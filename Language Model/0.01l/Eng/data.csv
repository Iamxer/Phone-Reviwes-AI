ive never owned a nokia phone before so this is a first for me i really like the phone alot the reception is greateven though the signal strength shows being low the quality of the phone is great too it feels sturdy and weighted i highly recommend this phone,5
it does a beautiful job i have used this item with my att account its good to see my bill so little and avoided big amount of billsi would recommend this product to any body very good quality it really met my expectations,5
phone did not come with a sim cardinformation i wouldve liked to have phone works fine but because ptt walkie is being phasedout on boost no sim rating is for phone but very unhappy not to have all the facts prior to purchase,4
wouldnt know anything about the cell phone i ordered because the person hasnt even shipped it yet its been a month and amazon has does nothing to help and really has nothing for an option to provide assistance,1
this phone was the one my husband got when we first opened our cell account many years ago he is not open to change and i wasnt sure i could get this phone again i am very glad i was able to get it for him and it is working quite well thank you,5
i got this phone because i wanted a phone that would have better reception than my previous phone however it never recognized any of the information stored on my sim card so it was essentially useless to me,2
this is the third phone ive purchased for my son since we switched him to att the first two were the same phone and were no good within a few months this one has lasted him almost a year now he likes it and i like not having to replace it all the time,4
horrible purchase came today and first thing i noticed is it is far from like new looks like my  yr old has been playing with it a few yrs avoid at all costs i guess its cheap for a reason dont waste your money,1
bought this for my parents who were reluctant to try a smartphone when their razr stopped working on their provider didnt work gave  stars because the seller tried to make it right but the second didnt work either oh well i tried,3
this is an old school motorola phone but works well and is reliable the only thing i am not crazy aout is that the battery doesnt last long it really needs to be plugged in each night i bought a newer battery but it still doesnt last that long,3
very delayed asked if it had any noticeable defects knowing it was refurbishedused but was assured it worked great extremely delayed navigating from contacts to messages and so on going to have to buy another phone,1
i was not able to activate the phone the numbers i needed off of the back were missingsome numbers on the phone did not work i had to pay for shipping to receive it and to ship it back i was only refunded the amount i paid for the phone,1
i have had  of these phones this one will not snc to the bluetooth in my car like m other one did it is the old programming and it cannot be up datedi want to return this for a full credit lets see how i get jerked aroud now,1
timely arrival phone condition was as advertised life of battery seems to be ok only disappointment in moving it to my verizon account was that the pictures i had on the phone wouldnt transfer to this one contact phone numbers transferred ok,4
the phone was ok but battery must have been junk would only stay charged for  day and after  weeks the sound went completely bad could not hear incoming or out going calls ended up purchasing a new phone from verizon so much for the like new advertisement,2
this phone has a mind of its own the video works when it wants to and the charge may last a day or  minutesnew this phone is the best but used you never know what youre going to get this particular phone is a dud,3
i ordered this because my current razr vm was not reliable in receiving a signal after several days i began having the same problem at first i thought it was verizon but obviously its not i have absolutely no complaints with the vendor,2
this phone doesnt stay charged and when the battery gets low it will not send text without notification the text didnt send has cause major headaches sorry i got rid of my other phone it worked much better than this one,1
i had a phone like this before and had no problems this phone even with a new battery with not hold a charge i would never buy a used cell phone again it has been plugged into the wall more than used to talk on,2
the volume control never worked replacement sent and after  month white bar across the screen was cheap but not worth it all the time wasted and we ended up buying an unusedunopened phone from another seller customer service was good but product not,1
it didnt work when received took it to the verizon store they could not make it work sent it back for a refund  i wanted it because of the slim design i carry my phone in my pocket wish it had worked ,1
phone looked brand new no problem at verizon with activation if you have the correct usb cable for this phone bring it with you i had to transfer contacts one at a time via bluetooth since that required two cables for them to do and they only had one,5
i havent had the phone turned on yet but it arrived on time and in great condition its for my  year old mom in law she is so excited about getting a new phone so prayerfully verizon wont have any trouble turning it and transferring her old service to this phone,5
i often have trouble doing a review  sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt i am pleased with my experience with this seller the item was just as described shipped in a very reasonable time frame and the price was reasonable,5
i have had  of these at a time on my family plan over the years and needed to replace a lost razr and let me i was not disappointed in getting this razr always reliable and small enough to fit in the smallest pockets,5
i can find no other cell phone as durable as the razr since i dont need a smart phone in my life the metal case makes this my  choice i hope the cell systems always provide support so i can keep on using the phone i swear by,4
the phone can not work very well battery runs out so fast i need to charge it everyday even i didnt make any calls and receive any calls my friends always complain a lot of noises i need to switch to other verizon phone to be able hear well,1
this is the second review it is the same as the first one  it worked well for the first two weeks not so well now the condition of the phone cosmeticly is not desirable however we are stuck with it and have to live with it ,3
i love this phone but mostly i love the fact i paid  for it i hate the idea of spending half a paycheck  on a device that lets people contact me at all hours of the day plus i have already dropped it over  times and its still good,4
we still have these type phones in our family and im glad we found one we keep this one in reserve in case the others bomb out on us in the future you really cant get these anymore and we dont want the new kind at this time,5
i bought this phone for my great aunt because it was something simple for her rather than the o ne she had at the time it charges fast and the battery lasts all day i recommend it to anyone who is looking for a simple easy to use flip phone,5
bought this for my dad as a birthday present my dad isnt up to the times with cell phones he doesnt even text lol but he needed a good sturdy phone for the basics making calls and some picture taking he loves it and loves the battery life on it,5
after  weeks of use  three of the button covers have fallen out and lost now i have to use a pen to push the buttons in order to control these  functions how long is the warranty on these phones i would like to have this one replaced,2
absolutely pos had it not even week first day got it button came off second week another and today lost most and said good shape bsthen wont give me my money back sorry but its such a pos i cant even send it back,1
second one of these i have owned with my line of work farming i am really tough on a phone previous barrage lasted  years through all the abuse glad i found another because simple function milspec phones are hard to find,5
i have one of these phones already so i knew what to expect but did not know what shape it would be in since it was used and reconditioned it looked almost new and functioned like newvery happy with the phone and price,4
the camera does not work the battery does not hold a chargeif i had know it was from the dealer dealscay i would never have bought itthis is the second phone i have gotten ripped off from this dealer,1
the barrage flip phone by motorola v is well designed sturdy and comfortable to use battery power use seems excellent and goes threefour days without a recharge will see if this continues as the months pass ,5
phone works good but was locked by previous owner phone could make and recieve contact calls only with previous contacts after working  hours with three different verizon reps phone works finei feel i am due a partial refund from taylor wireless please advise,5
since i have no need for a phone that can serf the internet etc i have a great computer for that i love my compact motorola barrage v phone it does all the things i require it to do and looks pretty too with its new red protective cover,5
very disappointed that this phone did not have a camera most phones have cameras now days the last phone we had exactly like this had a camera we thought we were getting the same phone how do we get a motorola barrage with a camera,2
this phone is no longer made for verizon so i had to search for it because this was the one my husband wantedhe is extremely happy with and would not part with itits dependableclear and sturdy for a working person,5
this product arrived in excellent condition both cosmetic and operational it was exactly as described i would suggest to anyone doing the same though to order the extended life battery and door as the battery that shipped with this phone was inadequate,5
would have been nice to have information with the phone serial numbers for registration had to remove the battery and find the identification number which is extremely tiny and hard to read other than that very happy with purchase,4
i am very much impressed by this product but also by the company that sold it to me recieved phone as told had a problem with one of these products was given a new product in a timely fashion all is well kudos to all,5
this was a surprise in the best of ways i had bought one a few weeks ago from some where else and i was very disappointed but with this phone i purchased from taylor wireless i am  satisfied i will buying from them again,5
i have two of these and they are great my husbands starting to get a little collateral damage and am shopping for a new one buy it you will like it if you are looking for one of those high class phones this is not it but it works well for what we need,5
i love this phone i work in a very busy office and i am always dropping my phone and getting it wet this phone is extremely durable and water resistant or in my case coffee resistant i cant say enough about this pone love it,5
the screen on the outside of the phone cracked under normal use no dropping etc had it in motorolas belt case all the time this area of the phone is poorly designed and low end materials the reception is good and battery life was great,1
phone no longer charges new battery  swapped battery from other v but it still fails to charge  the only way i have improved this failure is to turn the phone off flip it open then plugin and charge it while it is opened weird but it works,3
purchased this phone because it has been the phone my husband has used for years it was stated that it could be used if you had an existing verizon account that does not work it is not longer available for programing disappointed,3
i just want a cell to talk i have ruined several because of moisture this one has sort of a rubbery cover on keys and has lasted me longer than any phone i have had in a very long time for those who just want a cell to talk this is a great phone,5
the back of the phone was broken with the backplate not even fitting on properly the phone itself had gunk in all of the nooks and crannies disgusting would like a refundreplacement to change my rating,1
sellers sent this quickly and when you order something useful dont know what to expect was pleasantly surprised phone was in much better shape than i expected and it works great and battery was fully charged it almost looked unused for the price was great deal,5
this was recommended by a verizon rep and the phone is hard to use shuts off sporadically and has to have the battery removed to re start and gets worse reception than an older lg i had previously would not reorder,2
i have had my phone around seven years i love it it finally stopped working i am getting another one you do not need a manual to program and save and text it is a substantial phone and not dainty it fits in your hand so comfortably i highly recommended it,5
i really like this phone got it to replace the kin  which was awful the barrage is simple to use camera is fine and this one is waterproof not that it will survive a washing machine good sound quality with no dropped calls i would buy it again,4
i received the phone on time when it was time to connected i was not able because the phone was locked the phone did not come with the unlock pass code finally i was able to connected the battery was not good the phone was not in the condition that the seller said,1
the phone was for my mother and she says its works great i would give it a  star however they sent the wrong kind of charger and we had to go out and get another one other than that everything is great,4
i had foolishly expected that something would come with it to let me know how to make it work but there was nothing at all and since ive never used a disposable phone and dont have a regular cell phone its worthless to me thanks a lot,1
the item was not able to activate because the item was already activated by someone i had to go verizon service center and spent long time to cancel previous use and activate for my use please do clean business do not sell used one as a new,1
you said there was no contract and you have to get a new one too use this  i have a contract all ready and i just wanted to use this phone temporaley so i bought this phone for nogthing not happy ,1
im on my rd one with verizon  this one bought new as prepaid had to wait  months to activate with regular verizon blocked before that excellent phone but old technology means you cant backup or restore contacts  verified at a verizon store darn,3
i order it for my brother but he still said it was to small for him to see the numbers good but now i think he had my other brother to check it out and the setting was wrong on it but he is now not complaining so everything ok,3
 i ordered two identical items i received one item exactly as ordered and one with an extra attachment it makes me want the nd attachment for the nd phone  they arrived quickly and were packaged safely,3
this was a christmas present for my dad he loves it it arrived on time it was packaged safely its just what the low tech man needed hes not interested in smartphones this is durable and simple to use just what he had been wanting quality for a descent price,4
i have had this phone for almost two years its been dropped dozens of times and this past weekend it was dropped into a pool it still works as good as it did on day one however if youre looking for features this isnt the phone for you,4
i have a samsung rugby ii for almost two years it was working fine so far yesterday i accidentally dropped the phone in water and it died immediately this was the first mishap so the phones durability is definitely overadvertised,1
samsung advertises the a as rugged military spec f certified it is not we bought two one broke within month of ordinary use and samsung will not stand behind their warranty i suggest you find another phone,1
i would give this cell  stars but the speaker is terrible the worse of the worse  i have owned lots clam or flip phones this has so bad speakers it should pay you to take one  save yourself money  buy a cell you can hear  this one is useless  rugby ii sgh a ,3
this phone is rugged but the screen is hard to read in daylight and the voice quality is less than average i tried one out for a week and returned it my  year old samsung flip has a brighter screen and clearer voice,2
phone came very clean for what i paid for this phone i would of paid double the only thing missing was the original box and instructions if not i swear this phone just came out of the box new thank so much,4
i have had this phone for a month the reception is not nearly as good as my old phone the phone wont stop charging on its own verizon is replacing the phone wished i had seen these reviews before i selected this phone,2
i just got this phone from verizon last week after going back to the store and working with tech help online we have determined the the alarms will not go off on the hour they will function at  min past an hour weird i miss my old slimmer samsung,3
good ph but wouldnt work in mt so check with carrier to make sure before orderin  however if you goof like i did net  will fix it by sending a new one with mailer for you to mail it back to them just delays activation,5
this phone is indeed rugged and verizon permits a data block to be applied by calling customer service now my son uses it for talk and text only and i dont have to worry about the bill being sky high also the battery charge time is outstanding,5
was looking for a phone not a computer i love this phone bought used however had all previous owners contacts still on it was sold as perfect not necessarily perfect cosmetically but works great would recommend seller and phone,4
i bought  phones from them  however did not work and even after i fully charged they didnt go past the start up screen i contacted the seller and they totally denied that the phones are in unusable condition,1
okay i must eat crow here i cannot seem to find a way to remove the bad review in short i found the battery later in the box hooked up the phone and works like a charm my apologies to the vendor please let me know how to remove the other review and i will do so,5
i like the phone and it does what it says it will do only problem with phones like these is you have to set it on autolock otherwise youll accidently hit the buttons to connect you to the web and all your minutes will be used up,4
not a smart phone but this one does everything well though the keyboard is extremely small also the voicemail occasionally sends your old messages to you as if they just came in and in normal course doesnt give you verbal dates and times,3
i have only had this net ten phone for two months and it freezes up and does not load properly for photosiam how ever giving it a two star rating it is only good as a back up phone for making and recieving calls in case of emergency if you can get reception,2
a little tiny for my taste but it works quite well it has very good tone and is nice and clear this is definetly a very good thing because i have friends with very expensive cell phones that dont work as well as the net  does,4
i love this phone its easy to use the only thing i do not like about it is it can easily go into the browser and burn away minutes if you arent very very careful but thats all i do not like about it,5
im putting this review only because i never received it but thats only because i had a change of address at the time if you were going to order this phone you probably should because i read the reviews and they seem good,3
this particular cell purchase began with a limited budget keeping that in mind you get what you pay for not impressed nor disappointed in the least i got the whole  worth if you can get a recommendation from this or not remember you have been advised,3
mad when i got the phone and opened it i brought the same phone last year at christmas from radio shack on line it cost me end of getting two i could have gotten two for the price of one its still in the box,2
i like this phone its more expensive looking than it really is it does not feel like a cheap phone i feel like i have a black berry without the price of one i am very happy with my purchase thanks amazon,5
unfortunately i lost this phone on my way to a nursing refresher course all day i longed for this phone i missed it very much when i went out of town i never found it i never traced it and got it back,3
i am enjoying this phone took me a long time to get one more updated i can get on the internet now and take pictures however i do not see any call waiting with this phone and that is a disappointment other than that it is a great phone for a great price,4
this phones main function is for text  talk with some browsing options but it lack the kind of phone features youd get on a drod or higher however if you for gating a  phone with a monthy bill of  it a good buy,4
bought it for my daughter she loves it only set back is it will turn on in her backpack and go off it is easily set to on she cant have that happening in school keeps a charge for  days very reliable,4
received phone earlyfast deliverynice phoneeven though its an older model stores still carry this modelkmart sells it for   i will be buying another for myselfthis one was for my sonthanks amazon,5
like the phone good size and i like the structure of the querty keyboard its a rather light phone so it doesnt take up too much space in your pocket i like the usb mass storage feature on it as well so it works as a flash drive,4
if youre buying a phone for your young child just to keep in contact this would be nice however its not very sophisticated for an adult and lacks some basic features that i liked on my previous phone thats a later model than this one,3
bought the product to replace a prior phone that had a cracked screen set up was easy to transfer prior account thru net  and the price for the phone was cheap if your looking for an android phone you need look no farther,4
its a good basic phone it dont have a lot of bells and whistles because its not a smartphone it does run on verizon and i have never had a droped call if you just want a basic phone or a cheap phone until you get a new smartphone like i did its perfect,5
even dough it is a quadband phoneit wont work with some networksafter i bought it and try to use it in canadaall networks operate on mhz wind and mobilicity did not work very user friendlyif it works ps amazoncom were great with shipping,4
wow not a great product im an apple guy but surprisingly i actually like the layout of this windows phone however its battery life is terrible and goes off by itself sometimes makes it really not worth it,2
this phone is easy to use and easy to customize i bought this for myself my mom and my aunt my family laughed at the thought of me teaching them how to use a smart phone all i can say is success if they learn how to use this with ease anyone can,5
great quality for the price trust me fast smooth and great battery life just buy it if you think you need an unlocked world wide carrier capable phone and hey its a windows phone thats all i have to say,5
purchased two unlocked phones but only one came unlock contact seller and received code to unlock phone after numerous attempts i was able to unlock phone i am now please with my purchase i was going to return phone but decided to keep phone,4
the phone itself is set up well however if you are planning on using over seas beware it is not fully unlocked as the ad states phone was purchased to use in costa rica you can not use data internet email etc in costa rica,1
i am so disappointed brought this product on oct  got it oct  and it stopped working on november  it has no warranty so i was robbed i wrote the company that supplied it and i never received a response dont know what to do,1
i bought this phone as a replacement for a defective blu dash  android phone that i had to return have to say for a  year old phone updated to windows  this is a much better product highly recommended if you can pick one up at the  dollar price point,4
i am completely irritated and will never purchase a phone though you again the phone that i purchased was not unlocked as it says in description this is extremely irritating as we pay for data and are unable to use it,1
unlocked phone correctly it is an excellent phone functions are fast excellent photography brought your screen saver and all the accessories i recommend this phone and the seller is responsible and fast delivery,5
great phone many features versatile and quality a very nice lled sensitive display i was a little scafy having a smartphone but this one is very friendly and useful reception is great sou d is great and the price wasnt that high,5
after some time of using i realize that the network signal was bad i had to go outside of buildings to get the signal to make or receive a call other than that phone is great and multifunctional for personal use,3
my phone sucksi was wanting to get me a new phone and found this oneyeah then my son dropped and shattered the screen on his phonehe got the new windows phone i still have a crappy phone boooo,5
this phone is greatit functions well with my laptopbeing windows  also is a plussimple to useupdated to  easilywas already a zune fan and this works well for my music also plenty of apps available overallsimplicity being the key,4
one the worse samsung cellphone to complicated this windows version is nonsense compare with the previous one the one before was much easier to use this one the memory is a headache because it become part of the phone and once is in it you can not remove it,1
this cellphone is incredible is excellent nice display connection with exchange very simple really is awesome i can see all about your social networks link contacts play xbox games listen music the camera mp is wonderful,5
this phone is great but theres something wrong with my phones wifi connection i cant connect open wifi network either the network that i have known the password i am not sure whats problem with it i just hope i want to get solution from seller,3
the truth i thought it would be a little better but it sucks do not buy cell is a scam does not work on anything not grab the camra sd card and take a picture transvestite and does not keep from buying garbage that does not has warranty,1
i cant seem to get whatsapp downloaded on this phone its a pain in the neckwell the other features are nice but i wish the whatsapp would work and i dont like the fact that my windows live info comes up instead of my contact list,3
phone arrived on time in new condition after activating the phone is unable to hear volume being able to be heard also there is no text to speech or gps available which is dissapointing we would like a refund,2
this is the best phone ever if you are having problems with the app store download the zune software go to account settings update it will take forever to update from windows  to windows  but its worth it  app store will also work afterwards,5
pros nice os nice screen nice camera nice mail management cons battery life day you will have to charge the phone at night as an iphone hardware no good update march   mine died like this ,3
my first wp and i liked very much the power button stopped working after a couple of months and became a  minor problem but them speaker stopped too  now i use it for playing music with headphones and take pictures,3
i was really hesitant at first of ordering a phone onlineanything online actually but it turned out great i love it it came in the att original packaging charger and headphones included  i was pretty surprised at how well it worked too,5
this phone unexpectedly crashes microsoft windows for phones is another attempt from microsoft to limit you to microsoft applications giving you a os with less flexibility to adapt to your individual requirements,2
super easy to use its an ausome smartphone i use an att go phone sims  plan i go right now and there is no problems its big on techs without the high price big screen thin phone its light best phone ever,5
i was a little concerned when i bought this phone since i got it it is fast and so easy to adapt to windows phone i installed zune on my laptop and the updates went easily just miss the apps could have more,5
excellent experience all around delivery was quick everything came as advertised and the phone is terrific if people would get over their microsoft hangups they would see what a great platform windows phone  is,5
at first this was awesome but then it stoped working it worked for maybe  months the service this unlocked phone got was horrible come to find out it was becouse it wasnt really unlocked it was still att and we dont have thier coverage where i live,2
the sim card holder cells where the sim card make contact and transfer the data were broken and i have to replace it with part of the main board the cellphone can not recognize the sim in the actual condition so it cant be operate just as an mp,1
zune did not recognize my device using similar cables so have to purchase samsung cable shouldnt they ship with cable like every other phone rhetorical update  got cable updated to  pleased with the functionality,3
this is the best first generation windows phone from samsung samsung did a great job in getting things right the battery life is excellent in this device i highly recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for first generation windows phone,5
this is a very old phone and will never be able to run the latest windows phone software the nokia  is currently cheaper and will be upgradable to windows phone  in the future so if you want a good phone now look at something like that,3
good phone for kids that you dont want to pay for a data plan takes a little work and google hunting to get the configuration for the internet to work with all apps and mms at the same time but once set it works great,5
good phone for the money however all the instructions came in german  i do not speak german  i am still guessing some of the features and at times it is frustrating also sometimes the volume goes lower by itself,3
i love this phone my first smartphone and i am very pleased with the features it has it is a basic yet elegant phone great design size and shape perfect for someone who is not looking to have a lot of features or is on a budget awesome product at a great price,5
since the phone provider metro pcswould cost more then the one i have used over the yrs i sent it backthe overall choices that looked available by turning it on and going through the diffeent icon choices it looked like it owuld have been a good phone,2
i ordered this phone to replace my fathers flip phone he wanted to stay with a phone that was as close to his old phone as possible this phone had turned out to be a good buy two day shipping was awesome,5
this is perfect for anyone who is hard on phones my husband has now owned two of these it holds up very well to being dropped on a variety of surfaces exposed to extreme heat and cold and offers everything he needs without the unnecessary frills of a smart phone,5
just got the phone up and running everything is perfect so far  stars for expection of this phone for appearence compared to description as written by seller on time delivery and all items in box as described as well will update if any problems occur,5
had a phone just like this previously and when it died verizon had none like its available so my husband was very pleased to find this one which was just like his old one great phone and very rugged which is what he needs in his line of work,5
delivery was speedy phone was the same model i was replacing due to my carelessness and while not as nice as my new one is acceptable for the price just has some dings  scratches works fine so far,4
it was better than i thought it would be it arrived when it was supposed to the price was a good price but the express shipping was alittle more than i liked but the price was so cheap that it didnt actually matter that the shipping was high,5
it arrived dirty debris in the battery compartment and missing the cover for the charger port i decided to keep it anyway received  off for that but since discovered it does not vibrate or at least i cant get it to,1
i needed a replacement phone very close to the one my husband had he had it for years but it finally died since he has dementia  the cognitive decline that accompanies it he wasnt able to learn to use a new phone getting this was the answer,5
the phone operates great it was a replacement for one i cracked the screen on it was missing the cover for the charger port but i was able to use the damaged phones cover problem solved phone is very rugged but not indestructible,5
this phone is awful sends texts that you didnt write it pocket dials constantly if you have over  messages in the inbox you wont recieve any further texts its rugged but thats about all its good for had mine for about  months and it barely holds a charge,1
this u replaced an older u the  does not have the same rugged feel of the earlier model lacking the rubberized coating and heft i will be very surprised if the newer model has anywhere near the lifespan of the u,2
if you want a basic cell phone that also takes pics texts wakes you up in the mornings alerts you when to take your meds plus provides a handy calender calculator stop watch and voice activatedthis is the phone for you,4
this is my first smart phone and its perfect the keyboard rocks its quick and has a great camera now i am not a phone junkie i dont check fb play games or tweet with my phone i only use my phone for talking texting and checking email i love it,5
good phone i am in a g area and i can never get my youtube to work i had to delete many of my apps because they would freeze up i always updated my apps facebook didnt work liked that i could open more than one tab i could make calls and text,3
the shipping from this seller is awesome i ordered wens received friday i really like the phone not quite as quick as the blackberry online first touch screen i have had i really like this phone once i master it ill probably love it,4
i purchased this phone  below ebay and also the store price i received this item before the estimated shiiping date and also in new condition i am very happy and love the touch screen and keyboard option i would highly recommend this phone,5
my husband has been a blackberry fan for years and we recently purchased the samsung replenish he loves the new samsung and its android system the phone came to us in the mail fast and we got a really great price over all very happy with the purchase,5
i thought it would be better than the phone i was having problems with i even did my research on the phone before i got it and when i get it you dont get the options as i did with my other phone the seller was great an fast delivery,2
the phone was exactly like i expected it the only issue i had was that i could not access the marketplace in my region the bahamas but i was able to find a loophole would reccomend this to anyone plus the price is good,5
the phone was exactly what i was looking for it was a gift for my grandmother her first smartphone and it was perfect it was exactly as described and was shipped secure and fast i could not be happier with the purchase,5
estoy realmente maravillado con este telefono es excelente la verdad es que el telefono si me llego bloqueado pero al momento de realizar la apertura de bandas fue muy sencillo excelente telefono y funciona muy bien con todos los operadores en colombia,5
i bought this phone and it said it was new and it was a used phone with persons contact and name each time you try to set up your email on it the phone reboot itself and delete everything i would not recommend this phone and if i could give it a zero i would,1
this was a perfect christmas present i bought together with the case hard shield cover and screen protectors it was a new surprise because he had been looking for this model it was bit small in his big hands but he didnt after a while,4
simply love this little phone i hope samsung can continue to make theme gorgeous looks especially in the right case i got the black rubberized protector for itsold on amazon friends are amazed at how fast this phone really is,5
i gave this cellphone as a gift to husband on christmas it is unlocked so we can just insert our tmobile sim he likes it because its easy to use great resolution for pictures and light in weight i would recommend this one,4
i bought it to use in jamaica all u had to do is put your sims from your old active phone and it was ready to goscreen keeps freezing have to take the battery outsometime the people cant hear and u have to use tthe speaker fb and other apps are sooooo slow,2
this phone is not unlocked i have tried to call att to fix this however they are unable to unlock it for me waste of my time and money should not be listed as unlocked should have read the reviews,2
it hangs up display is not as bright i like windows platform but its definitely a subpar phone the call quality is good but you cant predict when its going to act up so i might just be ringing but you wont be able to take a call,2
el telefono en efecto está desbloqueado el sistema operativo es impresionante corre bien sofisticado y sencillo a la vez excelente para quienes usan las redes sociales y gustan mantenerse actualizados en las noticias y acontecimientos y con sus contactos,5
this is a phone without all the bells and whistles and thats exactly what i wanted it is simply a phone that is compact has decent reception and is quite good at one thing  making and receiving phone calls im very satisfied with it,5
i am very disappointed with this phone is just to outdated and my wife is having a hard time trying to send and received messages with it the screen is to small and make it very hard to see in it to many steps to do anything making the phone very difficult to operate,2

this was a replacement for my  year old cell and is better in almost every way than the last both are samsungs but this has better features and is faster than the last one so far im extremely pleased with it and i like the fact it cost less than the last,5
i guess i just expected a phone that doesnt need to do much except call and text to last a bit longer on the battery  of its life is spent in standby and it lasts less than  days but then what do you really want from a  phone ,4
this is a good phone for just talk and text purposes and it also has a great battery life it can go about four days before needing to be recharged although not very often receiving messages can be a little delayed,3
i normally only use my cell phone for emergencies but this phone is very easy to use so i have found myself using it more often switching between text modes is not as smooth as i would like but for the price  its general use its fine,5

i think this is a great phone i dont want on the internet or to take pictures with my phone i have a camera and a computer for that this phone does exactly what a phone is suppose to do it lets you talk,5
if youre looking for a cheap phone to just talk and text with this does the job its not particularly fancy and doesnt have all the fun apps that your friends with iphones have but you only have to charge it like once a week which is a huge advantage for me,4

these are great and so cheap i bought  of them last year when best buy had them for  a piece ive used them when i was in between phones and i also keep some in a first aid backpack because even without a phone plan they are able to call  in an emergency,4
ive found this phones qualty to be exelent  could use louder ring tone volumi do like the clarity and brightness very easy to readand being a clam shell i dont axidently push buttons witch is a aluss for me very sadisfiide with it,4

first of all it is not unlocked can not even use for att  so do not spend money on this also phone is not charging well  i have to push hard by connection plus point is it is new but no use to me not worth of returning,1
the only con is the address book is impossible to use it imported a lot of contacts incorrectly off my sim card was using razr before otherwise i love that is asks before connecting to data because i never want it to holds a charge for days and is cheap,4
the phone was new  what was expected works fine good backup nofrills phone bought originally for  through amazon stay away from newer sellers and their   prices this is ridiculous check walmart first,5

bought this one for my travels in the us and am very happy with it can communicate at very low cost   a day unlimited including internet but would like it to have a longer validity for my credits only  days still a very good value for my money,5
worked out well for us it was complete when it arrived and it is just what we were looking for we do not use cell phones except in and emergencies and we use little if any data this phone replaced a phone that is at least  years old,5
this phone is exactly what i wantedneeded the screen is easy to read the keys are large enough for my old fingers and it even fit into my old phone case if you are looking for a nice basic phone at a great price this is it jg,5

i bought this phone to replace a contract phone that broke all that is needed is to replace the sim card and it work perfectly with my plan i use the phone just for talking so i have no comments on texting data etc,5
the phone frequently powers off and will not turn on again it gets stuck in the reboot loop and i need to pull the battery any time i need to make a call should be fine if i need to call my folks but not helpful at all if i needed to make an emergency call,1
replacement for the same type phone needed for calls and occasional messages good basic sound quality needed to be reprogramed with sim card as it would not work with our family plan att was very helpful and it only took a few minutes to fix problem,4
bought this phone for my momso that we could place a sims card in it and that worked great the only thing she didnot like was that the screentext was so small but she mainly uses just for calling so that part works okay,3

this phone works very well in fact when my husban lost his phone i ordered another one our sim cards worked right away from our own carrier would recommend to any one that needs to replace a phone fast,4
this phone is crazy cheap and just works the t input system isnt as good as with sony ericsson my previous phone but again its crazy cheap good battery life good sound and reception if you factor in the price you can upgrade everything to great,5
i received the equipment i understand that it is a used equipment it operates correctly i think at least they should take the time to clean the equipment since it came very dirty regardless of the dirt the state is  out of ,4
its not for sprint sprint doesnt support nextel devices anymore would have been nice to know that before hand they offer returns but who wants that hassle would have been a lot more convenient to know,1
it is well built wonderful camera plenty of memory clear signal thousands of apps and it does not crash it does what it is supposed to do and really well and this is from a professional mac user windows has a decent product here finally ,5
i love everything about this phone but since it was att some features such as bluetooth still dont work but i knew that goin in so no biggie i love the os platform i think it is far superior i can use this phone as a mini stereo and it is wonderful,4
great phone i went with this phone to replace my htc trophy as my windows phone just to let you all know i am using this phone over an iphone s and a nexus  this is a rocksolid phone and love it windows phone  is still a great os no need for wp,5
i love my nokia lumia it was a bit tough to get used to at first but luckily my brother had the same phone for a while so he helped me my mom also has this phone and she loves it too its a great phone a bit pricey but worth it,5
i just bought this phone a few weeks ago and it is gorgeous the screen just blew me away and the os is very fast and user friendly this is the first time i try a windows phone and i have to say that its been a wonderful experience,5
arrived very quickly in perfect condition the phone is magnificent has many uses i was surprised when i realized that i could not share files via bluetooth but the phone is the maximum is exactly what i expected and at a great price this undoubtedly,5
i think price is normal orderedwhen i recieved phone was bad box not originalinside box not any manual bookearing only had carger phone looks used dont enter to market in anywhere dont reccomended    ,1
changed from an iphone to this phone and i am glad i did i love the larger display learning the windows system has been tricky but fun the hardest part for me was finding the right software at the marketplace to use to change the network settings,5
we bought this in the states wanting a global phone and it works great on our nz sim card we had to buy another one though because it will not tolerate being run over by a truck the sim card did though ,5
the phone didnt charge since day  it was very dissapointing receive a phone that does not charge and that it says factory unlocked but as in reallity is only an att unlocked cell it even seemed refurbished i wouldnt never buy from this supplier ever,1
not a fan of the windows software the delivery was excellent and the product was too just couldnt use the apps that i wanted this phone is the only lumia version that can not be updated to windows  so its limited on the apps that can be downloaded,3
good afternoon please i have a problem with the phone there is a problem with the phone bluethoo does not work and with the speaker because i do not listen to talk the other apps work fine i could do with this problem thank you,3
phone runs really smooth gorgeous screen resolution very good camera battery life is pretty good the only thing is the app store not enough apps and if you head droid before and love google stuff the you have to improvise,5
the box was not the proper one for this phone as promised and when charged it did not work the battery ran out and lasted only few minutes i am not happy with the product and the seller this is the second time i have something to complain about with this seller,1
i was good at that price it works well but if you have been using android you need to go through manual st bse this is window operated smartphone it has some differences enough space for storage but its skinglass and housing gets dirty quickly,4
friend i am from venezuela the cell that does not meet published reporting features he says he is unlocked and not so i could not use the charger does not work came with no manual and headset presents software failures i am not satisfied with what sent,1
i bought this phone because i heard so many great things about it however it does not allow many apps at all quite disappointing since i love instagram this really broke my heart its a great phone but not if your an app person,2
i got this phone for presenting it to my dad i highly recommend you guys to go for lumia phones if you are looking a phone for durability if it accidentally falls from your hand i am sure it can withstand the impact pressure when compared to samsung,4
a very good phone connection fast an excellent size especially for viewing websites allows sharing of a simple fast and fluid the downside of this device is that suddenly goes off to turn it back on you have to perform a soft reset,1
im sure this phone will work for me just as it did said inother reviews ii just ordered it but im kind of paranoid that it wont work i have att so im sure it should work if it does then i will be very much pleased and happy with my purchase,5
all in all good phone however i cant figure out how to use the zune music thing also the app store is very limited you cant connect via bluetooth to other phones for some reason i cant figure out camera is awesome the screen is clear and doesnt get scratched up,3
its very clean without any thing which shows that it has been used even once the mobile itself is great but i have another windows phone mobile its samsung focus i i think its screen and colors is better than the nokia one but in games nokia is better,5
its an excellent pohone i had a windows phone samsung focus an this nokia is wow is just excellent in eevery aspect battery life camera sound image phone quality and a super plus is the higher quantity and quality of nokia apps for windows phone,5
my nokia lumina  was an dissapoint the software was not good the battery was damage the phone get not turn oni both the phone in june and i use the phone for only two weeksi have the phone now for souvenirs,5

i ordered nokia lumia  gb unlocked gsm phone with windows  os amoled touchscreen mp camera gps wifi bluetooth fm radio  cyan blue from breed but i got this phone with att carrier doesnt seem to be unlocked phone,1
i love the nokia lumia  cellphone it has great features that are easy to use one slight problem i encountered since i am from another country belize is that the phone was not accepting my sim card i had to take it to a phone company to remedy the situation,5
i have received my order but i was amazed to discovered that the ear piece was missing please i want to know the reason why the ear piece did not came with the nokia lumia  because the description of the product says its a new product,3
the apps that are available works to perfection however i have not been able to download or bluetooth anything thus far and some features are not available outside of the usa its still by far an outstanding phone suitable for the office people and students,5
the phone is great but people complain that they do not hear me well on the other side do not know if the phone i bough have problem or not also the phone turn off immediately although i made the software for  min,4
fast shipment phone exactly as described very pleased works with straight talk im still trying to adjust from my iphone there are features the iphone has that i miss  love that this phone doesnt have but its still a great phone,5
im not going to say anything about windows phone because you should already know but the hardware on this phone is beautiful i did not expect it to look this good the camera is nice nothing amazing but not bad and the screen looks beautiful,5
i like the large screen my problem with this phone is that its not that simple to put songs on it plus we cant choose our own ringtone besides downloading apps to do so but its a good phone i must say,4
not one mark or scratch on the phone works perfectly great price great phone fast shipping would recommend this phone to anyone like it better than an iphone perfect for browsing net and can view all email accounts plus pretty decent camera,5
great i loved it  i like how it processes functions how it looks screen is wonderful and even better than iphone s screen no argument apple are pioneers in smart phones yes but nokia is getting there strongly,4
good morning sorry wanted to charge the product number order   and i have it in my hands i find the option to pay again do not understand why they do not charge the product greetings before hand,1
very bad product it was awful and nothing worked not able to install apps and not even able to save contacts the phone does not look new and when tried to return the product i had to pay for the shipping  awful experience do not buy from this seller,1
every thing else is perfect but i was really disappointed with the market place for not having most of the common top apps if you are a heavy gamer too then this phone is not for you but other features are great,4
this is totally frustating as though i have paid for the new one and extra shipping cost it arrived at me as a used one which is contradictory with the add heading now i have wait without any cell because of this rubbish,1
great screen very functional and easy to use did not realise data and internet access would be slower due to the fact i did not use att network also lost quite a few of the apps and functions that are only att compatible still all in all a decent phone,3
i was very disappointed when i purchased the phone it said new but it wasnt the phone had a couple scratches and it was repackaged it did not come in a nokia lumia box and the only thing i got was a charger the phone itself works fine but the seller failed,3
best smart phone for the price paid it has all the features including front camera for skype and other video calling apps battery lasts long compared to samsung and apple phones bit heavy compared to samsung and apple,5
got this phone and as hard as i tried to get it to work on the tmobile data network it just refused wifi was great but not on tmobile prepaid data plan needless to say it proved useless while out of the house,2
the phone had great features but i could not get picture messages or group messages nor could i send them i have had the phone for a few months and now my battery does not last within the day even when i am not using it i would not buy this phone,2
i loved the phone but it started malfunctioning in late january early february it keeps freezing up on me and the battery dies way too fast thing is im in the caribbean now and cant return or replace it,3
i received this phone and on powering it up all i got was a white screen unable to see any iconnokia lumia  gb unlocked gsm phone with windows  os amoled touchscreen mp camera gps wifi bluetooth fm radio  cyan blue,1
all accessories attached were not original the computer connection did not work and the headphone and mic are so bad the telephone freezes if you try to work with it while charging the charger is not original either,3
i bought the phone expecting tht it would be unlocked as advertised and was very disappointed tht it wasnt had to wait a whole  days to get it unlocked and paid a whole lot more tht was not cool but i got it to work and the data service still had issues,2
the only thing i received in my phone is the phone and a house charger i dont know how to open the phone or how to operate the phone can you send me the rest of the stuff to go along with the phone please,5
supposed to be an unlocked gsm phonebut after activating it with straight talk just says requires code to use on service used code i setup i presume i either need the right code from attnokia or strtaight talki have  try left ,2
i rate it with one star for the following the screen is scratched the four corners of the phone are battered and deformed the screen showed humidity inside charger is generic no hands free device product is not as described on page,1
the box shows heavy use the cell can see that they have been using and most importantly is incomplete ie missing the handsfree did not come in the box i demand the return of my money and deceiving buyers,1
the product is perfect and admirable to have but selling it under att is a dupe in the sea nobody would wanna buy this phone locked under att with there way of business just sell it unlocked with no contract and let the customer choose hisher own service provider,1
very good phone for the price smooth transitions between the apps but it is still a windows phone this means limited access to apps to download battery life is decent you can use it with regular use throughout the day without having to charge,4
the phone itself is nice however i am giving it two stars because it was not unlocked i gave it to a friend as a gift when he took it home with him he was not able to use it so nice phone but not unlocked,2
i love this phone i have one so i bought my wife one just like it my only complaint is the sound is not very loud in the headphones not sure if there is an adjustment for that or not it seems to be louder by bluetooth so that is the workaround,5
i finally convinced my husband to ditch the blackberry and get a nokia we searched and searched and he really liked this phone according to him this phone is more user friendly and easier to operate i love my new phone are his exact words,5
i believe the lumia did its best despite therere few apps useful  i do need to set up the g my own instead of automatically done by others brand anw att fone use tmobile is complicated  lumia did do the job well,5
nd amazon purchase that i got an item that doesnt fall in the new category as advertised the dirt at the ear speaker is quite visible and missing apps that are always preinstalled on windows phones are not there disappointed much,1
first of all the phone can work only with att so it is not unlocked the picture of the phone on amazon doesnt have att logo in the top right corner i got my phone with a logo and it doesnt work with tmobil though it says unlocked returned,1
the ability to transfer the existing contacts from the old sim to the new phone should work but for some odd reason that feature is turned off on this phone is it a windows  limitation or a phone defect it was good enough reason for me to return the phone back,2
the phone may simply stop charging in few months if you dont believe me google my nokia lumia  wont charge and find out yourself how many people are having this issue in addition your nokia may not have a warranty in the us please dont waste your money,1
the lumia  is a nice phone it is higher level of phone well built nice looking my dad is using this phone and now im looking forward to get the lumia  i know for sure that the  is out of this world,5
i bought it since  months and it is still gorgeous it works perfectly in my country  bulgaria i did not have any problem with it really fast browsing i love it and the camera photos are super amazing for mpx,5
the phone looks refurbished i was ok with that but two weeks ago the screen started flickering and it went off and even on plugging in did not come on for  days i tried it again it came on but has gone off again certainly not worth the purchase,1
now i know why the iphone has the best ui its simple it works and doesnt dial by itself the phone is sleek comes with a mini usb slot the camera has a reddish hue when taking pictures has the usual digital lag during snaps im back to my iphone for a while,3
i bought the unlocked lumia  but when the product arrived it wasnt i try to search for a un unlock code somwhere in the invoice or any paper that came with the cellphone finally i had to buy a unlock code over the internet,3
i bought this phone from us wireless it worked ok in the beginning but after a few months the screen just went on me i got up a morning and the screen was fuzzy i hardly even used the phone and it never fell i was so disappointed,1
since i received the phone i have not been able to use because it asks me for a code to unlock and in venezuela i have sought someone that knows how to unlock it and nobody knows now i do not know what to do with the phone i feel very cheated,1
bought the phone for my sons birthday  have the phone since october  but it is useless to him its advertise as unlock but its not we are unable to get the code to unlock it stuck with a expensive paper weight,2
i give the five star rating because what i saw in the catalog was actually what i was sent i liked the performance on the date of delivery and recommend this product and seller it is an excellent product to recommend,5
only came with the phonewall charger nothing else no stylus no manual ended up having to send back bought another one though from a different site and it came with everything but vibrates out of the blue,3
i love my nokia lumia it is great the only problem is that i cant send messages like ok but as i understood it was windows phones issue anyway i would reccomend it and the seller wireless extra ps sorry for my bad english,5
the cell phone was purchased under the condition of being unlocked after it arrive to my home i could see that this cellphone was att locked it will no work with my carrier so be aware when buying from this seller,2
excellent product im in venezuela and i received my phone before the expected arrival date and in excellent condition the cell its really unlocke it has wonderful nokia apps already installed its the best phone ive ever has thankssss,5
appears to be very durable no doubt about that but sim card couldnt fit i had  cut my sim to fit info about phone did not say it was mini sim very hard to pair with other phones for bluetooth but i like it it works,3
received the equipment and never lit i thought it came fully discharged and discarded with other chargers actually burnt wine team plus it did not bring handsfree or a users manual i am very upset about the teasing after me to trust in you,1
the phone is overheating added to that it has to be charged very often like every  hours or so i would appreciate it if someone can tell me how this situation can be rectified can i have it returned andor replaced please advise me soonest,2
lets say you dont charge your battery and then you need to make an emergency call so you plug it in and have to wait  minutes while windows hijacks the boot sequence to ensure theres enough juice to boot the system forget the call you just have to wait,1
everything is top notch the built quality hardware camera fluid ui and a great software experience only short coming is that it has fewer apps than ios or android but all the significant ones are there,5
i guess its my own fault for not reading the description when it clearly states no charger since i do already have one but phone is as described works well i bought it for only the battery door but good back up phone thanks,5
nice little phone to replace my original gusto which did not survive the washing machine easy to use nice display and features that fit most of my needs the prepaid plan minimizes the phone bill to a manageable amount every month,5
the description of this phone does not show it as a prepaid phone i was hoping to replace a broken phone on contract but this phone arrived and cannot be added to my plan disappointed with description the phone itself is good for basic users i currently use one,3
this phone will not work if you are in a contract it is pre paid only when we had another provider we could use the pre pay phones for our contract if we lost or broke a phone this one we were told is not a substitute,2
looked good when i received it charged it and it immediately turned off when i disconected charger verizon tech said it the battery was ok but phone was bad why wouldnt they test it b they sent it out wouldnt use seller again,1
took this to the verdon store when i received it bad serial number couldnt be activated they also told me this was a refurbished phone no mention of that in item description spent another  somewhere else and did get a new one very disappointed,1
after few months and normal charge few hours every  days the battery has started to bloat and become very dangerous you can not replace the battery and can not open the phone i stopped to use it,1
works as well as can be expected as it is an older phone had alot of trouble getting it activated nothing amazon done the phone was just unlocked and even though it said verizon it could have been hooked up to any carrier,3
just got the razr today took it in to the verizon store and they tried over twenty different sim cards of three different kinds none of them were compatible they told me the phone was likely refurbished not new,1
i meant to get a droid mini and accidentally ordered this i dont like it as much as i loved my poor droid mini that died i thought about returning it but it was pretty low cost so i am keeping it for now,3
this has been a great phone it has the large screen without the large body the battery does not last as long as my razr maxx but even with hard use all day it will make it through without a recharge during the day,5
when we tried to activate the phone out carrier  verizon said the phone was not theirs even though it had the logo on the phone could not activate it after try several cardsthe phone was returnedvery disappointed,1
the phone was greatwas purchased as verizon copatablephone serial numbers wouldnt come up on any network company was most helpful and easy to comunity withand refunded our money promptly  sorry didnt work for uscould have used phone,2
for this phone best company to buy from mango wirelessjust tried another vendor and phone came with glitches i have purchased many of these phones wife finds a way to break them best phone ive ever owned,5
completely happy with the new phone  i had the old droid razor m for  years and it finally stopped working a few days ago ordered this phone friday night am showed up sunday morning am perfect condition no issues,5
this is a awesome phone same size as iphone with larger screen and android this phone will outlast any phone ive seen and its g which makes the battery life even more impressive all the latest features in an android phone that fits in your hand,5
recieved phone took it to the verizon store to activate the sim card and they told me the imei number on the back of the phone is nonexistent in the system therefore it cannot be activated cant even get passed the start up screen without activation junk,1
this phone would not receive service no matter whatspent over hrsin a verizon storethe phone came with original owners musicemailand ohone numbers on it alreadynice looking phone but it just wouldnt accept serviceim giving it a one starand thats for looks,1
the phone arrive on time and was exactly what was described the only thing i dont like is that the phone is smaller than expected kinda reminds me of a iphone the phone works excellent and i havent had no problems out of it,5
extensive research by the tech and his supervisor could not find a sim that is compatible with this phone id love to use it i like the small form factor but if it ever worked on verizon it doesnt anymore november  ,1
received the phone faster than i expected changed out my sim card plugged it in works perfect few little scratches but i payed for a used phone not brand new i didnt want to upgrade at verizon rather have no contract this was easy and will do it again,5
had it for a couple years worked okay if youre an avid phone user its not for you this was my first smart phone pretty tough which motorola phones usually are but its junk compared to the droid turbo,3
all my complaints have to do with the actual model of the phone i recd it quickly and for a great price it was in amazing likenew condition as with the other razr m that i used to own after a few months it becomes insanely slow and close to useless,2
i got this phone for my daughter to replace her droid x and she absolutely love this phone its fast and responsive but the only flaw is the camera isnt the best quality other than that small complaint its a great phone,5
i bought this phone for my  year old son it is nice like my husbands regular sized droid razr but a bit smaller my son likes the smaller phone it has a great look to it and the screen looks really nice,5
the phone is just what it was advertised as the only reason i did not give it  stars is that the v dc usb adapter shown was not included and it took   days for the seller to ship after upgrading to  day shipping,4
did not want hd and dont think its necessary does what it says the phone is fast  reliable and going from a g droid x which was a nice phone to the g lte is awesome all day on a single charge highly recommend this phone cant go wrong with motorola,5
great phone at great price working in venezuela with h i need to check my data plan with movistar only thing annoying is the usb portwhich is on the left side i would rather have it on top or bottom,5
just received it wow fast processing and shipping as stated the phone is literally brand new no blemishes no functionality issues no problems activating also excellent price thumbs up to taylor wireless,5
the overall functionality of the phone is dreadful at best the phone has very limited capabilities after the first android upgrade the processor was virtual ly nonresponsive spend you  somewhere else awful experience,1
i had this phone for  hrs by the time i took it back i absolutely hated it without a howto guide this type of phone is absolutely useless ill stick with my jitterbug id give it  stars or negative stars evenbut you cant,1
this phone is simple but does exactly what i need it to do i bought this phone for my daughter so she could have a phone in an emergency it stores numbers it can text and it has data available my daughter is young but was able to figure out the phone,5
i call this my little travel secret agent phone because of its small size it is easy to take anywhere but does everything the big ones do i like the physical keyboard have gotten many compliments happy with ease of set up thanks tracphone,5
this phone was ok i didnt like the way the buttons worked but for the price it is a good phone its just a personal preference the shipping was pretty fast also i received the phone within a few days,3
everything about the phone is self explanatory but it is hard to find something small enough to hit the correct numbers or letters i havent seen a stylus that is small enough yet eventhough i have been to several phone sstores,2
quick sale and shipping using it as a  gb mp player wfm radio when i travel excellent battery life too not too shabby for   im happy btw it came with triple minutes if i ever use it as a cellphone ,4
i had same phone but it got crushed in accident i was happy to see it was available at such an excellent price i dont need smart phone just wanted a phone to call and text and take pics this is the one,5
no complaints it was delivered fast and easy to set up i got this for my husband coming home from deployment so he can use it while he has layovers it was cheap and will get the job done until he gets home and can get his cell phone reconnected,5
unit is locked to tracfone service only unlocking services cannot source unlock codes for this phone arrived in timely manor as promised and it looks nice i am just not willing to switch carriers to make phone work,1
is this able to be used as a government funded phone in wi safelink its the carrier i know the lg  is able to but the price is higher and it doesnt have the actually buttons motorolla does have excellent call quality,3
had my eye on this phone for awhile now but was waiting for the price drop wish i would not have waited so long my previous phone was a samsung focus and this is so much better great camera quality feel much better touch response,5
this phone came in great condition exactly as described and shipped fast took it to a local att store got it setup in  minutes love this phone i had an iphone s  and just switched to windows phone,5
the problem of windows phone should be attributed to microsoft as for nokia lumia   never broken nevermost toughest phone in the world  camera and screen are ok  the music is acceptable,5
i love the phone i just hope windows gets it to support flash player also i would recomend buying after christmas because prices droped two after on the  to the same as  all in all very good phone,4
its beautifulonly windows phone put people firstbut the operating system is not perfact for example this function attentive phone is not availablejust like htc x hope next update include this feature,4
best camera best nokia apps especially navigation and lenses and of course supported by best mobile os i like facebook twitter bing and few more services integrated right into os gives best user experience,5
excellent phone in great condition it is like new and worth to buy i like the windows phone but sometimes the phone can not reach the internet i dont know the reason and it take me time to restart it,5

 call quality is amazingly clear  camera is the best of its class i love photography and this is the best camera phone instagram please on window phone   i was totally amazed by the screen very clear  the speakers produces great sounds  its nokia,5
 same price against rivals location services  camera technology  upload new camera firmware fix wireless charging pad costs way too much vs producing one unit i hope you make more lenses for camera use and use rich recording more,5
i had used iphone gs for more than  years i siwtched to lumia  i start loving this toy  lumia  specially i like the design  and it gives me good feeling when i was holding overall i like it no battery issue yet it has wireless charging plate also,5
upgraded our  lines from iphone s   to this latest version it is built solid my favorite app is nokia drive used  for half one year my favorite app is nokia drive it is sometimes better than my wifes garmin like it,5
great sound quality camera city lens video skydrive maps and nokia drive  well you get the picture everything works just like you want it to the skydrive storage syncs with my computer running windows  so everything is good with me,5
ive had windows phones since windows mobile  i have been using htc windows phone devices all along and the nokia lumia  is my first nonhtc windows phone it is an awesome phone perfect size cutting edge features and performance very happy,5
ive had several iphones and this is far better the design is excellent camera and video are topnotch nokia drive is flawless last but not least now that im used to this screen i couldnt go back to an iphone,5
great phone no complaints thus far i came from a iphone s and will never look back the windows phone  os is great and feels like a breath of fresh air compared to android and ios good job nokia and msft,5
lumia  is fantastic mobil after  hour use i have still   battery left sound with my bose headphones is first class i read all my papers with lumia and not need anything else no problems whatsoever i just love this phone,5
i switched to lumia  from an iphone awesome super sensitive touch remarkable display and the amazing camera this phone oozes awesomeness also live tiles in wp are ridiculously good goodjob ms  nokia,5
you can sync all the data between your phone and outlook on your personal computer directly believe it or not this app is the only way for windows phone users to sync their contacts without going through some kind of cloud,5
i fell in love with this phone when my friend bought it and showed it to me i tried to make a photo at night and it was really good everything worked smoothly and seamlessly wp works fantastic and now i am waiting for my own expected tomorrow,5
pro great fantastic wonderful hardware design i love the live tiles personalizing my lock screen was also fun too gb of space and the phone charged up really fast  con battery could be better a little heavy a little slippery kinda big,5
i love this phone great battery life and nice design the quality of pictures are incredible i have never seen such a clear and high resolution pictures taken on phone i will definitely recommend this phone to all my friends,5
lumia  is much heavier and thick than comparable phones on the market galaxy g iphone  even htcs wp phones windows phone  still needs more work there is really no reason to select this phone from the numerous choices on the market,1
i bought this for the front facing camera to replace my  which was fine the phone is wonderful i love the camera and it is slightly larger than the screen on my  so its much easier to use i am a huge fan of windows phones and this is my favorite,5
i bought this as a replacement phone for my college daughter as hers died it was just like her old phone and we thought this would pickup where the other left off she used it for  months and it died i really expected at least year nothing lasts forever,2
i absolutely love this phone sleek and beautiful and a much prettier alternative to android or ios devices its really sad to see how uncommon they are taking up less than  of the market would love to see the lumia phones make it big,5
phone is very easy to learn especially if you are familiar with windows my first smart phone so i dont know if the horribly short battery life is the average of others or not  hours is the best i get with everything turned off except phone,4
i am very disappointed with this phone i buy this phone in nov  and it runs only one year and dead now its not opening and nothing is coming i dont understand what to do with this i spend around  for a year only on this phone,1
this phone was a problem from the start battery life was especially bad especially disappointing since i use windows  on my computer returned for a samsung galaxy s mini which is better in every way,1
got this for  how could i not perfect timing as my other contract was up very happy with att at the present time phone is working well with my rt tablet and home computer this is a great size phone for mejust want i have been holding out for,5
bought this for my husband after he had the lumia  for about two years and it finally broke down on him this phone is very good and i got exactly what i wanted the only downfall is the battery get a charging case for it,4
nokia lumia  yellow simply the most beautiful phone i have ever own i upgraded from my samsung focus and loving the new features of windows phone  loved the xbox smartglass app and the kids separate home page,5
just got the red phone and man this has to be the best phone i have owned i had the  but this is extremely fast and fluid the only downside i would have would be weight but i really dont notice that much its awesome,5
perfect its fast has alot of features and is rugged in feel and takes great photos the application store is a bit lacking but overall its a good phone note this phone has a huge screen so may be more bulky than people may want,5
excellent phone would recommended to everyone so happy with it worth every minute of waiting thanks nokia and msft excellent apps connection good battery life and it looks incredible just its camera and maps makes it the phone of the year,5
phone looks new and works great runs smooth and no problem connecting it to att all the apps i could want were available facebook netflix spotify etc really great price for a surprisingly awesome phone,5
very nice all round phone awesome camera feels great in hand superb build quality i consider durability also a part of the equation and some great free apps from nokia leaps and bound ahead of the competition well done nokia,5
from what ive seen from reviews and what people are saying about it seems like a great phone samsung has some of the best products and it makes it a convenient buy for people who dont want to pay an arm and a leg on the iphone,5
rd phone like this that i got one eventually broke after countless drops what did it was a drop at speed from a bike still works but the screen has too many cracks now the other two are still working,5
i am still getting to know what this phone is capable of doing but so far i love it i really like the ease of the keyboard i love the large captions at the top it is pretty easy to transition into after using a droid for  years,5
problem   phone constant rebooting  updated phone software yay day or two later  phone shuts down completely i am at a lost for words right now  truly disappointed i think i just want to return it and no replacement,2
i couldnt download any apps when i first got it so i reset it and that corrected that issue i also have issues wwifi connections but that could be self inflicted but i will say that it seems like a great os and id definitely recommend it  ,3
phone sucks brand new and internal spaeker no good going back to the nokia  lte better cell any day update seller will not pay me for shipping back to china what a rip off do not buy  beware buyers  ,1
its a nice phone but its a brick it is heavy and i wont be able to carry in my pocket it is user friendly i like windows for that reason we have the fastest internet we can have and the phone still loads very slowly,3
this is a simple phone to talk and text it works well the sound quality is acceptable for the price it has a micro usb charger which is the same charger used by most smartphones android and windows these days,4
i would say its a nice good looking phone the only thing about it is that they lie about the phone being unlock thats a lie i buy  of the phone thinking it was unlock like they sad and i end up taking the phone to a cell phone shop to be unlock the a the bigs lie,5
i purchased the phone june th and now at the beginning of january the phone is completely dead i had several problems with it and the phone would reset itself to the point where i had to reset everything up now i have to buy another phone,1
i should have looked at more of the reviews before buying this phone i took it to sprint twice in one day and waited for four hours only for them to tell me they cannot do anything for me the phone would not connect to the sprint network so that i could use data,1
the phone received worked but it kept dying even after being fully charged  i would have to keep it plugged in the charger just to keep it turned on if i had not cracked the screen i didnt have a have on it i would have returned the phone ,2
the phone is very good cant tell if its the bad service i have or the phone however i occasionally lose the correct time with the phone so using it as an alarm clock is out all the other features that i use are handy,4
i ordered a gb phone and received an gb phoneso clearly im not happyand to top it off i had it all set up before i realized it was wrongwent to put music on my phone and it says gb free of so wheres my gbidk,2
i love the picture quality of the screen the function of this phone far exceeds my expectations the battery life is about as expected i have had some connectivity issues but they were easily resolved overall a great phone,5
i was able to purchase my new phone through amazon with my sprint upgrade it was very easy and much cheaper i could not be happier with my purchase i am still learning all of the things that it does but so far i am very very happy,5
because when they put in the  update to the software they messed up the phones operation there supposed to fix it but they should not released it before they tested it more if you buy this phone dont put the  update till they fix it,3
just a good lil phone for the price of a penny it is a shame they want to stop subsidies but their price points are staying the same i bought  of these for my kids one is broke but it sure wasnt samsungs fault,5
phone home buying does not work consistently also has a lot of issues with the wifi turning itself on and off the g is also very unreliable more times than not i have to reboot the device to access any internet,2
it is everything i expected and then some this phone will be with me for quite some time and i will naturally stick with samsung products like i always have awesome phone and i highly recommend it to anyone,5
phone arrived on time since the phone was refurbished there were still problems with it sometimes it wont receive calls i would call it and it would say no one called the maps app is acting up i would recommend getting a different phone,2
fast shipping and this phone is wonderful this is my nd as i gave my last s to my brother when his died liked the phone so much that bought another one with the same systm case d this phone is a powerhouse of unlimited capabilities,5
this phone was for my husband he had one before but was damaged by someone who would not replace it i ordered the phone came within  days my husband just loves his android phone and has wanted nothing else hes happy and now im happy,5
phone seem to have some water damage the sim card kept reading that it was not in when it was inserted in the phone therefore we had to use the phone without a sim card which caused the data to not work properly without wifi being on ,1
it lost charge completely within two hrs with no use  all and after the next three days it gets and stays very warm almost hot and you dont even have to use it very concerned i only have had it not yet a month,3
the recipient of the gift loves the phone the only complaint is that they wished the ring volume could be increased even more since it does not appear to ring loud enough once the phone is placed in a phone case,5
this phone has more functions then ill probably ever use but it has the functions i was looking for in a replacement for my old flip phone im not a technology geek but this one has been pretty easy to use and im still learning,5
this phone is more then anything i could have imagined i can do practically everything that i want to do and more the picture quality is amazing although a little slow when focusing i would recommend this phone to any and everyone,5
overrated definitely i liked my old samsung galaxy ii better though this one has more features the features on the old device operates easier than this sound volume is low and some apps from my old phone would not work on this phone,3
love this phone my wife has the s so i opted for the s and i am not disappointed its like the s on steroids i would recommend getting a seidio case or otter box because it is very expensive to fix this phone,5
i thought the price was too good to be true but it was true as always i am very satified with my phone brand new out the box and priced better than all of the cell phone companies still getting used to the phone but overall i love it,5
 star is too generous the phone did come in factory packaging but with broken security label the phone was a factory reset and did not appear to be brand new the phone was not for the sprint network it was for yemen mobile the preset language was arabic,1
phone was in great condition was delivered quick but unfortunately it did not work  everything works great but it will not connect to g or lte it gives errors always on g the phone works great have not been able to figure out the problem,3
i love my phoneit does have a lot of built in apps i dont need but not sure if i should delete themand my phone did the same as my daughter no sprint zone first day or so but then poofit disappeared and mr mobile dude showed up loafing around ,4
we had this phone for approx  days would no longer charge discovered that the charging port was broken phone used by aged parent not mistreated bought in like new conditionno refund from this vendor this was the fastest  ive ever lost on a product,2
phone sucks it lasted  months do yourself a favor dont buy this junk its pure junkits unfortunate that amazon doesnt allow me to state the full story but its ok because today is the last time on amazon im sorry i ever shop on amazon,1
goodlooking phone came in  days which was perfect for my teenage grandson that had broken his old one no issues thus far but have only had it since thurs  no problems switching his service over either thanks again,5
amazon outdid themselves on this deal  cent for this piece of wondertech what a pleasant surprise i have  of these in use in the family and now ive finally gotten my wife out of her palm os and into the android world i am very pleased and she is happy as well,5
an amazing smart phone this is essentially a small computer in your hands it has very many different functions and with the free android software that is available there does not seem to be any limitations to what it can do way to go samsung,5
my husband received this as a gift for christmas early and he absolutely loves it great phone there are a lot of different features available on this phone which take a while to figure out but gives a lot of options,5
samsung has been stepping up coming from a galaxy s this phone is amazing i used most of the features and there are plenty more my favorite feature is the air view im always checking emails and being able to view it without opening it is great,5
good phone battery at first was great but after a month starting to die faster the charger that came with it charges my phone in abt an hr but i have lots of games the first day the battery was fantastic i still love the phone though,3
i love this phone im not into all the hand waving and phone touching but if i was this would be even more awesome its fast the camera is really clear and i get my emails apps look great on the phone too,5
really wanted this phone but it evidently was a manufacturers defect have used samsung galaxy for couple of years and never had any problems until the s arrived shipped it back and amazon happily replaced it with the lg g since the galaxy was on back order,1
had to return orginal phone due to dropping of calls so far so good with second phone dont like the fact that the  day warranty applies only to the original phone does not start after delivery of replacement phone,3
be careful with these the one i got was financially locked by sprint because of the previous users account being unpaid we could not activate it and had to send it back seller was good about it but i went elsewhere phone functioned fine otherwise,3
i have a galaxy note  and bought this phone for my wifes upgrade it is super fast and makes me want one the screen size is just right for a average size hand overall you cant go wrong with this phone it is super fast,5
pointless product i purchased this product and tried to activate the thing on start up the sprint booting info comes up so i called sprint to activate and they said that the serial numbers were not real,1
love the phone love the features love everything about it best android ive had yet i personally think the iphone is overrated i know quite a few people that have left iphone world and became team android,5
it is the greatest phone i have ever seen its better than iphone i wil definitely recommend this productits worthpeople should buy this cellphonegreat clarity and light in weightits good for girlbecause its light in weight,5
i love this phone the color is better and brighter than my older phone battery lasts longer than expected the processor is way faster than the older phone simply put best phone on the market in my opinion,5
the phone shipped as required and reached me within the scheduled time the phone works well and i have no problems my contract with sprint was up and i paid less by purchasing the phone on amazon great job will do it again when my contract is up again,5
smh the battery life on this phone is terrible takes forever to charge and at  it only last  minutes to top it off the camera quality could be better because it sucks and also the charger has to be wiggled in order to charge it several times,1
bought this as an inexpensive replacement for a stolen phone arrived in great condition exactly as described so far it has been a great phone for my mother and had no issues with the quality or service,5
i received this item march   the screen went black on july  and i paid  to try to fix the problem no luck in total i spent  for a phone that lasted a little over three months this the absolute last time that i will buy a cell phone online,1
great delivery i received it in great condition as well ive had the iphone htc and samsung this was a great improvement from previous samsung phones im looking forward to future products from them the only issue sprints service in our area is terrible,5
as an evolution of the s its fantastic its lighter faster prettier has a better screen and battery  it hits all the marks its just a great phone swap out touchwiz for something better apex nova gel anything and this phone will not disappoint,5
i had the galaxy loved it then it fell and cracked the case the s actually has a better camera and seems faster it is a little bigger by cm so i needed to get a strong cover i am happy with my s i love this phone over any that i had,5
galaxy s is very nice and for a penny you cant beat that price i have the s and my husband the s and i think i like the s more than my s and i paid twice as much for the s i will be shopping amazon for my next cell phone purchase,5
well everything nice was already said about how awesome and totally rocking this phone is i can only add that i cant believe how i survived without it and lived with blackberry all these years i am in love,5
this is my second galaxy s  and the price i paid was a cent i was using a samsung s  which i lost and i tried motox after that for few days and realized its not gonna work out returned to the store and bought the s  from here its really a great phone,5
the phone is a good investment it is like having a laptop the size of your hand i gave it  stars instead of  because it freezes and i have to turn it off and on to stop the freezing arrival was prompt,4
love my phone just need to figure out how to work all of the settings and apps etc since prior to this i had a dumb phone but the phone itself is great lightweight and easy to use delivery from amazon was efficient and seamless,5
its an s no complaints i love galaxy phones they are simply the best ordered the phone and it was delivered the very next day nothing better than super fast shipping when your excited about a new device youve purchased,5
i like everything about it i can play gamesemailsurf the internet all with one devise i love it i like i can send and receive pictures of my grands i would recommend the gs to all very happy with it thanks samsung,5
slim light nice screen great battery life and power management options they fixed the limitation on putting apps on the sd card recently as well so now this is everything i wanted all of your wildest dreams will come true,5
i switched from apple and am not clear this was a good thing for me i miss itunes and pandora i am still trying to understand why the battery life is so low on this product hopefully i will become a loyal fan,5
the phone has a known issue that it randomly stops being able to charge you plug it in and nothing happens ive tried battery swaps and countless different chargers reading forums it sounds like a known issue and samsung has done nothing,2
loving this phone i have had this for several months now actually almost a year its very easy to use graphics are great as well as the audio very durable phone the phone is fast and has plenty of memory im glad i got this phone,5
this is just the right starter smart phone for my ½ yo he wanted the latest iphone but i wouldnt and he couldnt pay for one this one is reasonable if he loses it rugged if he drops it and has everything he needs to communicate in todays world,5
i purchased it and went overseas cause i work with the military without checking the phone it had a cracked screen it wouldnt work it wasnt water proof cause when i opened the battery area and the behind the screen was full of water damage,1
this is the most unuserfriendly phone special cord unlatch open port coverand talk back wont shut up even after a factory data reset if you dont mind everybody hearing whats on your screen then youll love this blabber mouth,2
im no phone expert but this is a big jump from my flipphone to this im still in the learning curve but it seems to have all the bells and whistles it is supposed to have it seems to work well and keep a fairly good battery life,5
i like the phone but i just received the phone and its defected it keeps giving me a message that says unfortunately google search has stop working ok very frustrating i hope they will replace it with a brand new working phone,3
nobody can hear me because the mike is terrible when i first try to make a call  of the time the first time it says no signal it is nothing like my rugby flipi will be getting a different phone very soon,1
phone constantly crashed on me took forever to load appsbrowsers speaker quality not very good battery life subpar but i can say it was extremely consistent in that it inevitably froze every time i used it,1
phone was bought unlocked to be used outside the us operates ok but cannot receive sms text messages from my local provider probably because of an att software that is still on the phone dont know how to correct this problem,2
received in near perfect condition the phone part worked great with the sim card out of my old flip rugby but i had to get a new sim card and go to att to be able to get data this is my first smart phone so i am slowly adjusting,5
the samsung galaxy rugby that was sent to me was used and with no paper work to inform how to use it the phone was rattling around in the box it was advertised a new phone thats what i paid for and expected to receive not happy,2
went through two the first you couldnt do anything it kept telling you that touchwiz had stoped the second wouldnt google with a error message saying google stopped couldnt load anything or search with a new phone terrable workmanship,1
the samsung galaxy rugby pro  is user friendly i like the smaller size of the phone as well i just upgraded from a slide phone and im still learning about all the different options available for the price and my needs the phone is perfect,5
i love this phone if i didnt go to a bigger phone this would be the phone that i would use i have a bigger galaxy note phone but this is the ideal phone for someone who uses a small phone which also can be used as a smart phone,5
good phone for the price i live on a boat so being water resistance is a plus so far it is easy to use i got it in  days very fast shipping i use it as a phone so i have not gone online with it yet,5
product was unlocked when received works well showed minor wear screen chips easily when keys hit it but i just placed a glass screen protector over the screen and put it in a case i look forward to using this unlocked phone on straight talk service,5
i bought  of these to give to tow truck drivers and roadside mechanics theyre tought and reliable they still work after water shock broken screens run over etc we are slowly switching to kyocera duraforce xdbut i may really miss these,5
still working but came with and is experiencing slight problems from a red fine sand like something that is coated throughout the entire phone screen has a weird orange red tinge to it but phone works audio jack sucks on it,3
for the price buy a different phone the one sent to mne feels used and it wassuppose to be a new phone it is slow the battery life is real bad the phones that cost less then this the battery lasts way longer will find out if it lasts,1
in my line of work i need a tough phone and this one seemed to fit the bill it takes the larger sim cards from attt and the back doesnt seem to want to stay on but i bought an otter box case and its like a rock needa some quality improvements but its a nice phone,3
very disappointed screen cracked while in my husbands pocket did not need to be dropped or run over when the back cover was removed it was full of dust and dirt so much for dustproof good phone otherwise but is not tough as advertised,1
i love this phone had to purchase something to replace old phone this phone is fast small enough to make it easy to deal with and large enough to enjoy the screen looked at a lot of other phones and i am glad i didnt spend  to get an iphone,5
i can hear the person who im talking to just fine but to them it sounds like im underwater its been like this since i got the phone every time i think ive fixed it it just goes back to the call audio sounding really bad,2
my favorite smart phone a little slow and the microphones are crap but works great for use in austere and rough environments never came cles to cracking the screen and i have dropped it in water several times without any real issues,5
so far i love this phone had it about a year great quality does everything i need and more only thing i dont love it i wish i could delete some of the apps that came on the phone that i will never use love the rubberized case,5
nice phone for the money just like a samsung galaxy s not mp camera just mp and gb storage drive with firmware but having a plus that is water and dust resistant having in my jeans pocket all day easy to take out of the pocket,5
good phone this one is meant for my girlfriend and shes been wanting a sturdy phone but i wanted to get her a smartphone for the hell of it so why not and its great for the first timers just dont expect this thing to be secreting performance with  gig of ram,4
has some sort of glitch freezes up some sort of popup message about google i have to do a master reset annoying otherwise i really like the phone very durable easy to use for a newbie to smart phones,4
horrible it didnt even come with a battery  it was suppose to be in great condition looked like it was ran over  it feels and looks cheap i found much better phones for same if not less after this,1
one of my dogs bit my phone and caused one button to lock itself i loved the rugby and wanted to replace it with the same the phone was in very good condition only missing the charging outlet cover works great and i am very happy with this purchase,5
os was pretty dated and even updated it cant run some of the latest apps it does the basics but i would not recommend if you want full smartphone functionality that being said the seller was great i would definitely do business with them again,3
its a good phone for anyone whos a little tough on their phones the only thing that i would change is the location of the buttons non the side theyre to easy to push while you talking or texting and change the screen other than that im happy with the phone,3
this phone seems to be as durable as suggested by ads has been hard to find a hard case for it the jury is still out but i expect that it will preform well i will get another one soon still learning the phone limits,5
unfortunately my boss didnt listen to me to try this phone as soon as he received ithe doesnt like change the voice is all garbled i knew better than to buy this phone too good to be true  it usually is,1
phone came in quickly and works great had a bit of trouble getting the pushtotalk feature to work correctly but after updating everything on the phone and getting a new sim card it began working as it is supposed to will be ordering more in the future,4
this phone i received must be a bad one because it does not perform as good as the reviews it locks up constantly and does not open apps well both sim and memory card are new i am very disappointed with performance of this phone,1
i have had this phone for over  years i love it best phone i ever had left it on my roof it fell off at  mph dropped in pool drop it every day still works great and the screen has no cracks i dont even have a case for it,5
i love my nokia  the windows phone  interface is so much cleaner than the android phone i used to use win phone  may not have all the apps but it has most of what i want plus unlike android i can easily and fully uninstall what i dont want,5
my first smart phone been loving it wish ap developers would get with the windows program and offer more aps banking etc for windows systems there are still plenty of good aps out there for windows anyway,5
had the phone a few months though i was happy with it the first week i got it i wanted to wait a while to see if any problems came to the surface nothing has the phone is in excellent condition came on time and i have no complaints very happy with purchase,5
the phone had scratches on the screen that was not visible in the pictures or stated in the description it also had a crack in the flash would not have paid the price i did if i had known i was getting a defective phone,3
ordered refurbished nokia lumia  after my old one took a dive i was sweating it arriving before i left on vacation but it arrived on time and i was able to get it set up at the local verizon store the afternoon before we left this phone is great,5
initially i was worried that this phone would be slower than its  core android counter parts this phone only has  i was honestly surprised it is as fast as any of my buddies note s and even their new ss speed to use this phone is really fast,5
i like the phone but it doesnt have a self timer on the camera it is fast and easy to operate but sometimes you feel limited on what apps you can get overall the phone is pretty nice for the price and it does take nice pics,4
i like pretty much everything about the phone my only disappointment with the one i got was a got a good bit of dead pixels on a solid black background in the camera mode very disappointed it bugs me even though its somewhat hard to tell,4
i am very happy with my nokia  i wanted a windows phone as i am familiar with windows    and i am satisfied with my decision as i learn all of the available features i become more and more satisfied with my decision,4
great phone when it works replaced st unit after  months the speaker would go out randomly nd unit being replaced now touchscreen freezes  of the time after  hard resets and unlimited soft resets months of unhapiness,2
i have been a nokia phone fan since i got my first cell phone which was a nokia i was thrilled when they finally introduced there smartphone i am still learning all the things i can do with my phone but for now i am enjoying the process,4
where do i start the speaker works sporadically and after  months doesnt work at all so i sent the phone into nokia and the monkeys in the service shop cant find a problem garbage but it has a nice camera  star for the camera stay away,1
i like the idea of a windows phone with its cross functionality with microsoft office for work functions but there were just too many apps that i rely on missing from the store so i had to return it i owned this for all of about  minutes,1
i love this phone but you definitely need a screen protector it has a super soft screen i have shattered the bottom left corner twice and even the slightest thing will scratch the screen other than that i love this phone,4
had one for six weeks and the earpiece stopped working verizon overnighted a new one and ten days later had the same problem plus speaker phone malfunction and would not hold a charge do not buy this phone,1
i loved this phone once i got it all set up unfortunately the touch screen quit responding at about  week it happened suddenly and i could not even shut it off i will buy another one as soon as i get my refund next time ill get a certified refurbished nokia ,5
it is indestructible i dropped a scanner on the screen without a scratch dropped it numerous times even accidentally washed it with the bed sheets it took a week but it is dry and alive battery life was decent screen beautiful i loved it,4
i like this phone it is easy to use and understand for those of us technologically challenged my original nokia lumia was stolen along with the user manual this replacement came well packaged but without the original box and no user manual,4
love it what more is there to tellgreat looking phone in fact it looks brand new and the packaging looked brand new does everything it is suppose to do thank you oh it also came a day earlier than expected that was a bonus for sure,5
awesome camera awesome call quality awesome build quality awesome os wp is frustration free silky smooth fun different and robust enough to tinker with awesome native ms office integration highly recommended,5
nokia has a great product here the camera is awesome i like the lens effects i find the windows is to be very clean intuitive and stable the app store is a bit disappointing but similar in scope to the original android store in its early days,5
barely  months after nokia delivers on the revolutionary  here it comes again with the  finally on verizon an improved lighter version of the  sweeet love the wireless charging love that industry leading camera love the design sign me up ,5
i am lucky to be the first one to get a black phone from verizon with a new ordered batch of phones i loved this phone so much that i went ahead and added a new basic line to get this linked to my existing number you would not be disappointed with this phone,5
perfect condition phone it has some quirks working on att being the international version no really issues but takes a bit more setup time and things like softcard only work currently on att branded phone,5
love the phone but unfortunately when i recieved the package it came with a crappy charger didnt even plug into the phone amazon was nice enough to refund me partially but besides that i love the phone and it matches the description perfectly,4
love it to bits had it now for a few months and has never acted up or failed me now with the new update which includes cortana the phone just keeps getting stronger the built quality and camera is really what sold it for me would recommend,5
everything that i expected from the phone as described and priced very well only feedback to the reseller is to offer more quicker options to ship i needed this much sooner than it was shipped but no options were offered other than that good phone,5
yes this phone is really fast even with the new windows  mobile which is a great improvement over  way better than my previous  and  lumias however the battery is just horrible it probably only gave me from  to  hours of screen time surfing the web,4
it wasnt a tmo branded phone maybe thats why it wouldnt work with my sim card and my data plan wifi works as it should it is a top quality phone win os is so simple and powerful to use the size is perfect for my small filipino hands,3
great phone was pretty beat up beyond what the description lead me to believe the box was from asia so setting it up for english was fun also the camera appears to be defective at times takes solid white photos,3
this phone cost  dollarsand came with a water spot on the screen it also decides not to work when it wants to it rarely takes a change my daughter really dislikes that bc she has been wanting this phone and all it has been is trouble ugh,1
we are still pleased with the phone after having it one year the only downfall is storagememory which makes the phone slower we suggest getting a memory card or upgraded phone other than that very good phone,4
the phone was exactly what i expected and more i really am happy i got this phone it is a nice phone and it really exceded my expectations i highly recommend this phone i ordered a refurbished one and it is like it is brand new,5
granted ive only had the phone for less than  hours the phone is exactly as listed and the shipping was extremely fast i upgraded my boost service to this phone from a kyocera hydro the orginal and it was very easy and quick,4
received phone today  works great  but i paid extra to receive the phone in excellent condition and with a charger included the phone is not in excellent condition  it has multiple scratches and i never got a charger,1
i buy this for my mom and the phone is giving a lot of problem and a i hate that because its just a month now and it freezing on her shes complaining i dont think im buying any more phone from hear i feel safe buying from the stores,1
looks nice but has very poor signal battert dont last long like how it says battery life is so poor internet is bad it freezes alot its so sad to say that my kycore hydro worked better than this junk,1
every time i call someone i cant hear them they assume to be able to hear me they let me know via text that actually works this phone is crap worst phone ive owned can i send this in for a full refund,1
i have been only taking this supplement for two months what i can say its that my skin does not have bad break outs any more and my lashes and eye brows are fuller but thats it i havent noticed a difference in my hair yet we will see only time will tell,2
this phone is great i love it you can do so much more with it than you could with the freaking samsung galaxy prevail piece of s phone this phone i can get better service with it than i did with the freaking samsung galaxy prevail,5
when i saw the advertised about the  phone on the amazon page it says the packet include the phone the charger and the hands freebut when i got the package and i opened it was only the phone and the charger the hands free was not in,3
i got this for my son whose old phone gave up the ghost he likes it a lot and says it gets good reception is relatively fast and fits in his pocket it seems to be a very good buy since the price was very reasonable,5
came fast and was in good condition but did not like the fact that it said on the package the esn might not be clean because it didnt say anything about that in the description at all but everything works fine,4
this is better than the prevail  which was the first phone my wife got with boost after giving up her blackberry its basically a smaller version of the galaxy s loads of features and excellent price best android phone for  no contract on any network,5
there are so many negative reviews on this phone and i honestly dont know why its a good phone has a pretty big screen lots of space it does lag sometimes but its usually just at the end of the month when you need to reboost add money i would recommend,4
this phone is locked to boost it does everything it was purchased from amazon the phone had to be reset several times after activating the talkback program that was a major hassle and i couldnt do it myself i had to have mom do it,5
not even one star the phone just stop working even the the at the phone store didnt know what happened to it i didnt drop the phone or drop it in water but for some strange reason it just stop working,1
i bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it the samsung galaxy prevail is perfect for a th grader this phone is just enough for her lifestyle of watching videos texting and playing games i cant get her to put it down,5
i bought this cell phone for my grandaughter and she loves it i love the price she loves the fact that it was easy to set up it has two cameras front and back loves the color the clear screen and most of allshe loves everything about it,5
hi ive had this phone for about a year now tho i didnt buy from here i bought it from a store this is definitely a good phone one draw back that this phone has i think would it can be slow at times including when powering on it is a little thick too,4
would give zero stars if i could when phone arrived and i started using it i found out the home button was stuck down and that was not mentioned and was categorized as like new very upset and disappointed especially since this was a present,1
bought this phone and had it delivered january th  it worked well for three months then shut itself off on april   i have replaced the battery hoping that was it but no change this is one of the few purchases i regret from amazon after about  buys,1
i love my phone but after certain period of time my phone says sim not inserted restart phone but my sim is in there so i have to power off and extract sim and put in again and then it works again but its so frustrating,4
go for the  gig because im already getting warnings about not enough device space most of my apps and all of my music photos etc are saved on an sd condition was fantastic for a used device though,4
i love th i s phone it is everything i expected i only take pictures talk and text everything else is a bonus i am not into being on the phone or playing games all the time so it is perfect for me easy to operate,5
too much bloatware ill never use and cant delete its always wanting to update and load my memory w junk pay attn samsung not all users are young and always on public sharing sites the phone works well for meintuitive easy to use,5
superb customer support shipped and arrived early and as advertised if not better than very impressed by the quality of my purchase will use ndlife for my next phone purchase and highly recommend them to my friends and family,5
unable to make calls did not ring on my end yet connected the call the person on the other end would only hear loud screeching really liked the quality of the camera and the rear speaker put out some good sound when watching videoslistening to music,1
the phone was crap there was something wrong with the sim card reader and  times a day i had to restart the phone so it could work in middle of a phone call it would shut the phone off saying no sim card i wont buy from them again,1
absolutely great phone for a great price  amazon offered with  yrs contract no other retailer could beat this price the phone comes with amazing features and battery life the apps run fast and is very responsive,5
my camera failed have tried all suggestions on resetting and still not working correctly this is a known problem showing up on the internet i purchased this phone because of the camera love then phone  while cam was working,3
she came from an iphone  so of course this phone is godlike to her lol its a good phone and specs are really good its plagued by samsungs terrible software and slow carrier updates but i rooted it with cyanogenmod  and its a beast,5
i bought this being very skeptical because its used and the cheapest phone on amazon but im pleased to say that the phone came looking brand new and was in great shape and now couple months later is still working good phone and great price,5
do not buy you are better off paying  for a phone that will actually work this phone was a complete waste of money it randomly shuts off and will not turn on until it is plugged in again and will not hold a battery charge,1
my first smart phone and i love how easy it is to use it has and does everything i wanted in a phone and the battery does well compared to other smart phones in my family after seeing what it does my mom wants one now,5
i just received my phone today it arrived early works smoothly right out of the box and the screen is flawless the only use i see is some slight marks on the edge but theyre so small theyre barely noticeable i highly recommend this product and this seller,5
smooth fluid functionalityquick responsegreat screen size for watching videosmoviesbut wish the battery was a little betteri use it a lot and charge it once a daywhen used less can come upto  daysoverall its great ,5
as advertised att smartphone had a few minor dings in the bezel but overall in great working conditions excellent replacement phone for the one my daughter had broken arrived prior than indicated and with a  day warranty great deal for a great price,5
my husband really likes the galaxy s but it kept giving him a message regarding the sims card even after replacing it twice at the att store we tried to see if we could get a replacement but was told we couldnt he was not happy,2
the phone was chipped and scratched pretty bad on both sides of the phone thank goodness i have a phone case that will cover this it was in pretty bad shape the screen was perfect though that is why i have it more than one star,2
thank goodness for amazon prime and their representatives the product functioned properly but had significant cosmetic damage and was not like new fortunately the amazon representative was there with a number of solutions to save the day,3
the phone has some problems it wants to restart a lot because it wont detect the sim card after a couple of hours of operation even though the card is present and secured properly reseated card several times  sometimes it works sometimes not so much,2
phone came new as promised has performed as all samsung galaxy products do excellent my only regret was my last phone was the note and this screen is obviously a bit smaller i would order again from this supplier,4
excellent but delicate this phone does everything i could want and more basically replacing my old tablet however the phone is so delicate that a slight drop with a protective case is enough to cripple it we had two dropped one,3
when i first got the phone i was really happy with how good of a condition it was in until once the warranty went out it started having hardware issues it is a beautiful phone i just wished it worked as well as it looks,3
phone came with cracks in the plastic rim that surrounds the screen also the screen malfunctions when phone temperature reaches over  degrees f replacement procedures would leave me without a phone for weeks,2
i updated from a palm to the samsung galaxy s and love it i am now in the current century quality is great and att has been outstanding with their service still need to figure out all the apps but i couldnt be more pleased,5
samsung galaxy s is by far the best phone ive ever had was so used to iphones that i thought i would be disappointed but the s is a superior phone only downside is in my opinion itunes is head and shoulders above google play,4
first of all the battery life sucks i need to recharge it every four hours and i have yet to figure out how to make it move with the swipe of my hand i have only had it two days so i will come back to edit my review later,3
seems a black phone comes with white cords and i was told i could chose my number which after signing up i wasnt the programs have issues to from text scrambled weather wont up date for days sometimes,3
im so sick of these phone companies charging the consumers for the price of the phone that makes me sick i finally decided to get an older phone for a cheaper price and just pay for the whole thing at once this phone is exactly what i was looking for,5
great phone all around of course i dont download a lot onto itbut the asthetic is nice but make sure you purchase a case screens are so fragile and it costs more to fix the screen sometimes than the phone itself,4
love the phone  the galaxy phones are great the s is nicer though with the waterproof features we went through two of these before we got an s once it was a little bit of water on the table that did it in,5
phone has a lot of features and is perfect for someone on the go picture quality is good wish the battery would last a bit longer even when it is on the saver mode it drains faster than i would like but i would still recommend this to anyone,5
just upgraded to the galaxy s after years of having the s othere than the giant camera upgrade with the s the s is still in my opinion the best phone ever made ahead of its time and still holds its own against new flagship phones  years later,5
great i just have to find the time to learn how to use it to the fullest i know i have a quick reference guide but i probably need to read additional instructionsdont know if it was included but overall i cant complain and for the price i wouldnt,4
ive been putting off getting a new phone but finally decided to do it so far i enjoy the s i had a galaxy exhilarate for a few years so there wasnt much of a learning curve to this phone for me i like the bigger size and it is easy to use,4
it was a nice phone features wise but no one could hear me when i called and a message would pop up and say it couldnt recognize the sim card and restart which kind of frustrating when i was looking at the maps,2
although we got a refund i was disappointed i sent this to my father for valentines and he had t take it in every other day to be worked on it kept frying his simcards very sad hopefully i can find him a good working phone,1
this was in perfect condition set to factory settings it quickly upgraded to the latest kitkat software everything has worked perfectly why would anyone pay  plus a  year contract to anyone im on the att  cents a min plan with no data,5
it has everything only reason im withholding the last star is all the bloatware installed by cell provider and i know that isnt the phones fault phone is fast and calls are clear and dependable ill keep it,4
my samsung galaxy s arrived within a day and in great condition i am so happy with my phone its exactly what i wanted i was relieved to simply put my straight talk sim card in add my refill card turn my phone offon and be good to go super easy,5
i purchased this phone after doing a lot of research i have had it several months now and still absolutely love it i have had no problems with it whatsoever and it still has great battery life i cant think of a single negative thing to say about it,5
first smart phone for my wife really likes it more features than she will use for a while still trying to figure out why she had garbled voice reception for a weekend but that may have been a network issue,4
i really like this phone purchased for my gf son and he absolutely has enjoyed having this phone and has had no complaintsmind you he is a year old in hs uses multiple social media networks music downloads instagram you name it,5
phone would not charge and would lose battery life when connected to charger had other issues that were apparently related to the operating system i am wondering if i was sent a refurbished phone i had to trade it out at a warranty store,3
was delivered quick item is as described a samsung galaxy s black mist gb what was vey nice was the phone number was sent to me before the phone i was able to have my business cards made up with new number before phone was delivered tht worked out perfect,5
this phone makes me a better person its light decent battery life good screen with great resolution and totally intuitive to start using a i bought a lifeproof case to protect it and its an awesome combo,5
these are the worst phonesand verizon sells them deceptively to peoplenever once offering me to exchange the phone for two yearsafter  complaintspoor connectionhardware on thesebuyer be very aware,1
terrible texting phone pretty good for everything else cant handle even small texts without bogging down and freezing up pictures it can handle only  or  at a time and forget sending little video clips,3
its not as great as people say i cant text it blocks most of my contacts to me its a hassle i cant talk for long the cell beeps better with an i phone this cell is made sloppy at times i cant hear my cell ring,1
purchased this phone and received yesterday when i tried to activate it as a replacement phone for the basic phone on my plan i was told this device was no longer supported by verizon call before you purchase and verify it will work for you,1
i did not want a smart phone and this phone has more stuff on it than i will ever use i am really thankful to the salesman at the verizon that suggested that i buy it on line and save myself a lot of money,5
rd one of these that i have purchased for my husband because hes hard on phones it provides good basic cellular service pretty much no frills which is fine with him long lasting unless you forget to remove it from your pocket when swimming,5
bought this for my diehard flip phone brother he is really enjoying it he can be hard on his phones but think this one will fit the bill phone arrived extremely fast prime not offered but wirelesscheap shipped at no cost highly recommend,5
phone was as advertised hardly any sign of wear or obvious scratches flashlight camera and other functions all appear to work fine was activated with no problems i am very happy with the phone and would buy from the seller again with no qualms at all,5
cute and quirky little phone manual doesnt tell you everything you need to blog do not turn on voice command it is a nightmare to turn off battery doesnt last too long but for amazons price this phone is tops,4
this is a terrific phone at a great price the sound is extremely clear and audible it is sturdy and easy to use amazons price on this phone was unbelievably low compared to other prices found elsewhere great purchase,5
this product worked fine for the first two weeks after that no one could hear anything i said it worked at times for short periods it has taken me weeks to find another phone i am now returning this phone,1
i had been using the phone for less than  weeks when i noticed that the front screen was broken i dont know what caused it to break the screen protector i put on it when it arrived is the only thing holding the glass together,1
bought this for my brother who had a touchscreen basic phone that was constantly butt dialing and locking up it suits his needs perfectly and he could not be happier with it and i was happy with the priceway cheaper than the verizon store,5
we are having difficulty with one of the two phones we ordered it has to be recharged frequently and they both sometime fail to ring alerting us of an incoming call therefore we miss calls they seem to have a delay in lighting up when flipped open,3
bought this phone for my father to replace his convoy  you can make the font huge in the menus but the texting font is unreadable its tough for me and im  such a shame i have to return it over a tiny detail like this,1
for over a month ive been trying to find a fix for the alarms neither verizon nor samsung have helped this problem dates back to the convoy  according to the verizon community otherwise it is a nice rugged flip although way overpriced ,3
this phone is an absolute hunk of garbage i am on the fourth phone in three months three of those in the last three weeks microphone goes out and no one on the other end can hear r what you are saying stay away,1
this phone works great for my husband he just wants a simple phone to use when needed he doesnt want or need to go on the internet or take pictures he just wants one to make phone calls this phone works great for what he needs,5
i had problems with this phone from the very beginning it wouldnt hold a charge they shipped me a different battery and it worked for a while but stopped working after  months warranty is only  days so im sol,1
its a flip phone works like a flip phone i bought this phone to keep my wifes personal number while she uses a work phone havent really used it its just been sitting in a drawer the battery did last nearly a month tho so theres that,4
purchased this phone for my husband after his got run through the wash this phone is very sturdy and great if you arent into the whole texting thing bought this a lot cheaper than going through the verizon store for the very same phone,5
its perfect for my husband who is always doing something outside in the weather he needs a rugged phone just in case there is an accident plus he cant hear very well and he can hear clearly on this phone,5
i would not purchase again cant hold phone wo turning sound off cant easily access speaker phone or lock it on red button is useless for my needs i will be getting a different phone and it wont be a samsung,1
works great with clear and crisp communication the only thing that i dont like about it is that on the motorola barrage an older predecessor phone the volume was loud this phone the volume isnt as loud and i cannot hear it over loud fan noise or engine noises,4
the phone was defective not sure why but verizon store screwed it up called verizon and they shipped another one out with no problem but this phone had problems my father who i bought it for loves the one that works though,2
knew i was getting a used phone but this is the worse purchase i ever made with amazon scratches all over the phone some buttons dont work well and when im talking it sounds like im under water very disappointed,1
the alarm clock is faulty and the phone lags whenever i receive any text messages i have to open them and they disrupt whatever i am currently doing on the phone i am not impressed in the slightest with this phone i will be returning it,1
i thought this was a brand new phone but it has so many quirks and now i have to tske it to a verizon store to have it checked out and i am disabled and only yrs old and very sick with lots of physical stuff so thanks,2
the phones sound quality is excellent sound is very distinct much better than most small phones that i have used it is also a handsome easytohold phone that has great sound for a small phone an excellent phone,5
overall the phone is good the only thing is that at first while on speakerphone the person receiving call had problems hearing me i later discovered that by cutting off noise cancellation setting the problem went away,4
im so glad i bought this phone it came on time and package was sealed i upgraded from a galaxy s to the s i love it takes awesome pics i was able to switch it to net i just put my sim in this phone and it automatically switched no regrets,5
i ordered this phone and the shipping was delayed but based upon the information provided it was due to usps and not in any way the sellers fault when the phone arrived it was as promised i have used it for a couple of weeks now and it works fine,5
not satisfied with the phone because i had to bring it to a repair shop because of its microphone which didnt work properly then for the volume button which was stuck i tought i bought a new but it wasnt the case that time not happy at all,1
awesome phone i got is gently used actually seemed more like new minor scratches phone is a dream and the battery life is awesome finished charging it once i got it and the charge is going well into the next day my seller was icing on the cake,5
the s is awesome it has all kinds of cool feachers i love google voice and the new android os  even though they have android  samsungs apps work awesome with  the camera is great and the zoom is awesome,5
if you want a simple phone go for the iphone but for tech geeks like my self is a definite buy i had this phone for sprint for like  weeks loved it but the plans for it is outrages thats why im going to the the tmobile version,5
just got this phone today and it came earlier than the expected shipping date phone is in perfect condition and im using it as i type i was in desperate need of a new phone this was definitely a great buy worth every cent,5
thought this phone would be much faster but its no faster than my old phone the picture quality is ok just disappointed over all plus the seller sent me the wrong charger so i had to go out and purchase one not a satisfied customer,1
it is exactly as it was described it works perfectly with minor scratches it came with all the necessary items to use for a day to day basis the cell phone company had no issue of making this phone my primiary cell phone,5
cant beat price and not even refurbished saved over  will buy next phone this eay only problem my verizon store was really not very interested in transferring photos and setting it up without them selling it to me main drawback,5
the camera slows and out of focus and the whole phone itself seems slow i had a samsung note before it was fast and was great for pictures which is the biggest reason i bought this note if it wasnt for this defect it would have been a perfect  stars ,3
first product that arrived had a bad battery and would not stay on without restarting randomly company was wonderful and sent me a replacement very quickly they included everything i needed to send the broken phone back,5
this is a great phone and good price the stylus could be a bit more sensitive but i think thats on samsungs end hope it lasts at least as long as my note  did i did download a different note program because the layout changed from note ,5
looks almost new arrived on time however no cell phone charger came with the box all of the cell phones i reviewed had a cell phone charger included so i thought it was general practice to include this with the cell phone,4
i ordered this phone on a friday and it came today  monday extremely fast shipping phone works perfectly looks great no cracks or scratches on the screen takes pretty pictures i am very happy with my purchase thank you,5
without getting all technical if you dont need the latest greatest s s edge note this thing is a powerhouse unto itself i am very happy with my decision and for the price  with yr contract how could i not be,5
so far this has been a great phone purchased used on amazon ive had it for about  months and i really like it i hate to pay retail for anything so this is great it is working smoothly on a rd party verizon network i will probably buy my next phone the same way,5
if the phone worked correctly it would have received  stars i got the phone on time i charged it for  hours using multiple chargers only to find out they sent me a phone with a defective charging port,1
battery to phone is no good phone will not hold a charge charger was not the correct charger sent an alcatel charger that is not strong enough to charge phone very disappointed do not buy from this store,1
for a use divice i will give a  start there was not signe of use at all verry happy it come with all accesories cant ask for more the charge was not compactible with it but work on my others divices great deal here thanks,5
todate my favorit phone ever yes it is a bit larger at  inches it is fast and fun the galaxy note phones are excellent for anyone wanting to use less paper i use mine note  to take notes and make todo lists annotate pictures or pdfs i just love it,5
this phone is great its nice enough to where you dont think of it as an old phone and the stylus is pretty cool too the bigger screen really makes using the phone easier and honestly more likable surprisingly good battery life,5
i went through a lot of extra trouble to get a refurbished new note  huge fan of the phone but im giving a  because for a refurbished phone it wont even read a micro sd card at all its missing a pin connecter,3
own for  months and love this phone works everywhere with verizon service have had no problem just finally filled up and now i need an sd card for storage of pics and videos not hard to hold due to size actually very comfortable great features,5
i am very satisfied over half a year after purchase it was surprisingly easy to have verizon connect my new phone this is legit i lucked out by getting the phone an older model for way cheaper than what i found elsewhere and am very happy thank you,5
am enjoying my upgrade from a razr maxx wantedneeded a bigger screen this fits the bill i did find that the bare phone was very slippery  was always afraid it would slip from my hand a simple case from amazon took care of that problem nicely,5
once i got all of the account information to match up the rest of the transaction was smooth in fact this is one of the best phones that i have ever used light fast and stunningly beautiful it makes my note  look atrocious,5
i love this phones features but ive had to replace it twice in  months first it wouldnt charge now its booting down and restarting itself and verizon only wants to replace with a like new or refurbished phone,3
i had my motorola droid for years and thought i loved it  i did not know what love was  i absolutely love this phone it is taking the place of my computer on the road works great on my verizon network,5
i had been wanting to upgrade to one of the newer notes for a while i had the original note and held off until the note  came out amazon had the best deal and i am very please i waited this phone takes care of all my business and home chores,5
i liked it but it gets laggy and bogged down with heavy use nice sized screen needs special charging cords usb i switched back to the iphone  plus to me a higher quality product better build too,4
brought galaxy note  as a replacement for my wifes iphone  at fist she wasnt to sure since it was a big change now that she has been using it she is in love with it she can now do things for her job much easier than the previous phone she had,5
i love this phone i switched to it from an iphone  i really like the big screen and all of the cool features it has that im still figuring out and it was such a good deal  less than the verizon website,5
i switched to this from the note the  looks better is a bit more powerful and has a better display not not a huge upgrade to he honest  i kind of preferred the feel of the n rounded edges but the n square looks better,5
the description for the phone i bought said very good in the description i was expecting a phone with a few nicks maybe a scratch but i received a phone with a cracked case and very bad chips on the edges of the phone,2
fastest mobile device ive ever used wish i had bought it sooner a few tweaks of the default settings and its perfect cant put it down wont get into the tech specs you should know if you are reading this review,5
this phone was supposed to be in excellent condition the pen is broken and the silver along the sides is all dinged up and dented but over all phone works good and you got me to buy something else from your site because now i have to order a new pen,3
this phone does everything you could ever want in a phone it is so fast the sceen size and viewing quality is out of this world its like a computer in your pocket the camera takes the greatest pictures all i can say is wow,5
this phone is uncomplicated and user friendly its fast no waiting and screen quality is excellent after reviewing many phone options i chose the samsung galaxy note  and it has exceeded my expectations,5
great phablet the stylus is a pleasure to use and the battery life lasts a good while even with heavy use love taking notes with the s note app that was preinstalled overall i would recommend the note  to others,5
love the spen love the screen size got the uag case for it which fit nice and snug came packaged with sim card and activation didnt take too long so far ive had it for a few months and its beautiful,5
this is a great phone but the flash light does not work this is the phone i have always wanted i had to give it  stars because everything works except for the light this light is for the flash when taking pictures or when trying to use the phone for a flash light,2
phone arrived as promised it was purchased in very good condition and it looked brand new the sides of the screen dont seem to work as well as the rest but overall i am very satisfied with the purchase ,4
i love this phone i have had it for a week now with no problems although i had to go buy another charger because the one that was sent was the wrong one and kinda cheap quality other than that the price i paid for this phone was great highly recommend,5
this is a very good phone it came looking brand new and it works very fast i had no issues getting it activated on a prepaid account through verizon wireless i absolutely love the storage and the way the phone works it was definitely worth the money,5
so far so good the charger plug did not work but i have extra one  home to charge the phone phone was in excellent condition week later this phone is a blast to use glad i bought it and didnt break the bank,5
could be a little more ergonomic with respect to the placement of the buttons but otherwise an outstanding smartphone it functions exactly as i hoped it would and i would recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing a quality large screen smartphone,5
the battery life is fantastic he always had problems with batteries but this one withstands his frequent use of the phone love the product wish it would have came with the charger that is meant for it but overall wonderful,5
i choose note  for the program processing speed  and the internet speed the no delays in watching educational videos im happy with my selection and can live with it for the  year term with verizon,5
overall the product was good the only bad thing about the phone is that it came with the wrong battery i would have given it  stars if it werent for that so i ended up having to purchase a battery for it which meant i had to wait another week or so to get it,3
my wife is in love with this phone ever since i upgraded her from the galaxy s to the galaxy note  nice large screen and the stylus is really cool it is recognized by the phone just hovering it over the screen and it has its own popup features for the stylus,5
i purchased the verizon galaxy note three i love the condition of the phone but the only thing i hate about it is that it keeps losing service in certain places at my home you gotta be in a certain spot to pick up service and thats just crazy,4
its a big phone but the price was unbelievable and i love the phone itself the screen is awesome and with older eyes it sure makes it nicer when i have to show my parents how to do something on their iphones it is really a struggle,5
my sons picked this phone out for me to replace my droid and visor and it has been great easy to use and see tremendous battery life great pictures i have absolutely no complaints about it and would recommend it,5
this phone is awesome it can do almost anything the battery lasts for  days before i need to charge it there are so many things that it can do that i need to go online and learn about all its capabilities very happy with my purchase,5
crazy phone huge screen fast and i havent had a problem yet the battery life is great and im also a huge fan of the speak texting it has i could never go back to iphone if your thinking about this phone then get it,5
at first i thought size would be to big but its perfect for me i dont need my readers when using it  it has so many features i have yet to but will get to overall its the best phone i have ever owned,5

arrived quickly works awesome and i love the phone has been a blast setting it up and learning many of its new functions i found youtube videos extremely helpful to discover what the phone is capable of thank you,5
the phone is fantastic the only reason i have not given it  stars is simply because the flash for the camera has not worked since it was taken out of the box i will be switching it out for another one as soon as i find the time to,4
bought for great price as a new verizon customer i learn three days later could have gotten it  cheaper also could have gotten a s instead s for same price all good things come to those who wait over all i am still happy,5
i read all the reviews on this phone they all seemed good i was attracted to the screen i really liked the large size of it and the pictures seemed pretty good too so i went from my iphone to the galaxy note,2
ive had the note  and previously the  and with both i had bad signal and it would constantly overheat sometimes the phone would be idle and still overheat i replaced it twice and same issue this phone has a lot of bells and whistles but lacks reliability,2
works perfectly really clear screen best samsung model phone ever only problem the replacement bezel used in this refurbishment is even cheaper than original samsung one silver paint chips off even when in protective case,4
i love my note  it does everything well i have a new tab  and still prefer to use my phone for most tasks i could do on the tablet many people say its too big but i disagree i plan to upgrade to the next model when its available,5
pros fast boat load of features sturdy cons spam google will shove about  apps down your throat samsung another  as well as verizon not actual s estimated low speaker volume dual window mode only works with a small amount of apps,3
wow i havnt needed to root unlock and install roms at all yet the stock rom is plenty fast enough for me and the battery life is amazing i would typically get about one day from my s and i get about  days from the note,5
phone stopped working shortly after i had set it up screen remained black even though the back and navigation buttons turn on flashes white for less than a second whenever i attempt to restart it defective returning immediately,1
this phone doubles as a small compact palm top computer with available apps such as autocad  adobe pdf and more swore i would never give up my casio brigade cell phone after a bad  smart phone experience but the samsung note  changed my mind,5
concerned the product was sold as new and believe it is refurbished  only had couple months and already having issues son mad at me  yes he is an it and works on these  he has a note  feels it was misrepresented,4

ive had this phone for a week and i love it its not too big for me it fits in all of my pockets and it has a case on it beautiful display and great functionality i dont even know a fraction of what this phone can do,5
great phone  great price i have to admit i am still learning about it my previous phone was not nearly as sophisticated so theres a learning curve for me but im having a blast ps the camera is awesome,5
this product arrived as scheduled it would not work for mobile data phone gps and wifi worked i ended up using this as a remote for my tv since my galaxy s doesnt have that capability it is fine as a backup gps on my boat,2
what an incredible awesome piece of tech super fast love the screen size there has been some teasing from my work pals about the size though it does take a short while to get used to the size of this phone but i wouldnt trade it for any other on the market today,5
fast and tons of memory this came with gb compared with the mb of my old epic g and a slot for another micrsd card i added my old gb one reserve several days to learn all the functions of this feature rich smartphone,5
amazing cellphone im very happy with it all the details of this cell here is true for me is the only and also can you use two applications simultaneously i really like the battery is also durable i recommend it,5
the screen quality is second to none this is the best phone i have ever used the bigger screen allows you to do business like you are at a computer i just ordered  more for family members from amazon amazon is the best place to purchase these phones as well,5
great phone perfect size easy to switch from iphone  to samsung and android even with some adjustment time im always pleased to finally have a phone thats easy to read and often takes place of a tablet,5
absolutely love my phone this puts any phone i have owned or used to shame i will be upgrading to the note  instead of the iphone  plus due to how much i loved my current phone display is the perfect size,5
loving this new phone i can actually see the screen was a little worried bout buying a used phone but so far its working well except for a freeze up every now and then but not enough to be annoying its been a great phone so far,4
this phone is beautifulfeatures galore screen is stunning feels great in the hand and super fast multi tasking is a dream the only down fall i could see is the size for some ppl size is perfect for me though,5
great phone unlimited capabilities specially when you expand it with the usb otg that allows you to be able to do so much more when i attach the usb otg i can expand my memory by using a regular usb thumb drive,5

dare i say the best assistant available phone calendar schedule note taker presentation manager research tool some things just cant be completed by typing thats where this tool comes in simply the best phone there is,5
absolutely positively the best phone on the market period look at any benchmark testing look at the stats look at the screen the only downside is the plastic back but its  who doesnt use a case or have a protection plan,5
best phone ive ever owned i was worried about the size at first but got used to it after a few days perfect for watching netflix or listening to music so many adjustable features battery life is excellent despite large display,5
this is an awesome phone does not feel cheap in any way well done to samsung love this phone does so much phones today are like little mini computers just awesome phone not a bad word on anything,5
i choose  stars because this device deserves no less than  stars pros bright display large screen fast processor lots or ram great device cons does not have kitkat yet cmon samsungverizon i would recomend this to anyone who wants an awesome phone,5
this phone met all of our expectations the screen is brilliant and sharp it is large for a phone but it serves as a small tablet and lets face it we use smart phones more for surfing and texting than talking,5
at first i wasnt sure if i liked it the phone seemed to have a few glitches but seem to have worked itself off no sure if its new or refurbished either way it works well i give  stars to shipping though phone arrived fast,4
this is my first smartphone and im pretty happy with it pros micro sd card gb option big screen cons why not  sd card slots why bloatware why have a pen i ordered this phone on amazon but  days passed and they never shipped it so i picked one up at verizon,5
love it  i drop this phone maybe more than  times without the case  and no break what so ever  not like my previous i phone screen  best phone ever  btw i got white one  so pretty and thin ,5
two of my family members received these phones several weeks ago there are persistent and serious problems with call quality that have never been resolved many calls to tech support and updates did not resolve the problem,1
there was a lot of damage and use showing all round the sides as well as the mirousb power plug was pretty beat up i even asked the company if this was a new or used produced there responce was  new  shame on them,1
omg worst phone ever seriously i was in a time crunch and had to have a phone as i was traveling to nashville i love you guys though i host a morning show in dallas and always talk about you but man that phone sucks,1

shipped very fast just wanted to try a window smartphone to see what it was like the nokia brand is pretty good quality for the price i am happy playing around with this phone get my emails and surf the web a little i am not activating it as a phone,4
ive had this type of phone for a while and my original one started having issues purchased this one as a replacement but it had more issues than my original one so i returned it and went back to using my original till i can afford a newer model,2
at first it wasnt working and we were going to send it back at the suggestion of microsoft but for some miracle it started working so there was no need hes happy with the phone bought it for my husband so were happy,3
warning if you plan to unlock this phone like the other reviewer says do not do a full reset it will erase your imei  and make the phone useless for any carrier otherwise its a nice little phone with a nice price for those who needs a phone just to call and text,5
this is a great phone for the price its very easy to use very lightweight and small enough to carry in your packet the only negative comment i have is the buttons to browse the menu are kind of awkward,4
this phone was bought for my wife who rarely uses a mobile phone i needed to get her something that would be as simple and basic as possible and the samsung v has been the answer i appreciate the simplicity and the battery life of the phone,4
have trouble getting a signal in the house have to go out on porch someone said if you have metal in house could be the cause otherwise nice simple phone good for the older folks who dont need a iphone,3
after a very simple unlock phone i use it on simple mobile excellent battery life the only thing kinda dont like is the buggy menu system when pressing the center enter button its trying to open att website to me that middle button should bring up the menu instead,4
want just a simple flip phone nothing fancy this is the phone for you and you cant beat the price also if you arent going to be using it as a go phone which is how it arrives you van activate it through att over the phone and get the cheapest phone plan ever,5
its a phone that rings and has a dial pad and we can use for voice mail thats all i needed to add a line for mono contract with atts mobile share a review att would be lovehate at this point but there are no really good carrierstried em all,5
works with the other samsung i had to buy as it is the same phone but was never able to get the phone nunber from the phone i bought on amazon so went to walmart and bought a identical phone and the charger works on it,1
this is the probationphone when teens privileges of using smartphone been taken away i bought one for each of my teens so that they could still make phone calls the price is so good to beat it can be unlocked to use other carriers,5
i had been looking for a flip phone for months  wanted just a phone not a computer no apps  this phone is just greatcharge the battery using the included minicharger  insert a simcard  no activation excellent,5
confusing interface numbers to small ring tones annoying reception not so great does not need to be so big i have an lg phone from ten years ago that is smaller what is up with that so it is heavy in my suit pocket and annoys me,3
simple phone but it works well had to call a t  t and go through their automated process which uses voice recognition once activated it works well i use this as an emergency phone for my wife if your iphone malfunctions or she forgets to charge it,5
the plastic backing comes off too easily my father complains about it  elder man  about it coming off multiple times a day when its just sitting in his pocket the speaker is not good enough for elderly adults i was hoping it would be good enough but no,3
i no book im an unhappy camper not really happyhad my old flip phone for years could not find a battery replacement when it died i got the new phone but no book of instructions so its a bummer of a deal,3
it is a simple phone durable and clear i did not realize it did not bring a sim card with it  i dont know if the seller mentioned that or not because i dont recall  just beware you need to get a sim card if you buy this phone,5
this samsung phone has all the basic features voice text address file etc and its very small compared to some of the smart phone monsters that will barely fit in a mans pocket just a darn good basic cell phone with a long battery life,5
i hadnt realized that there is no camera charger or instruction manual with this item ive contacted samsung for a copy of the manual and they say the product is not one of theirs made in the us can you help me,5
i buy these for my grandparents as cheapie att phones while they work fine most of the time my grandmother is on her second device as the first just up and died for the price they are tough to beat if you just need a basic phone,3
i bought this phone for my daughter she is using it on a friends att family call plan  she said she put her sim card in the phone and was making calls within minutes calls are crystal clear great buy,5
i bought this as a travel phone my iphone doesnt have a sim card that i could find so for the price this was a good backup plus i didnt have to worry about losing it it was a bit retro to text but otherwise it was great,5
this phone is perfect for my grandma she doesnt know how to use technology very well and does struggle with even this but with all of the other phones available this is the perfect one for her situation i was pleased with the price of this phone and its brand new,5
i had a good sim card and my phone died so i needed a replacement for the best price i could find this was it i mainly use the phone for calls and text this does it well the sound on my calls was loud and clear,5
it worked for a little while but after about  months it stopped working altogether suuuuuuuuuuuuuucked if this is all you can afford buy extra batteries or something i couldnt really figure out its problem but i went back to smart phones sooooooyeah,2
had to buy two of these for my parents who are not into smart phones they were coming off the old metal razrs these work fine they are plastic but for the price worth it without a doubt also good for an emergency backup phone att here,5
i got this product not knowing what to expect it works great it came with full battery and came with a new sim card it was a great buy i dont use it for a att go plan i use it for everyday use great phone,5
functions properly no issues with the software hardware had minimal damages to edges of the phone nothing outstanding or anything worthy of notice i dont know what else to say this was a great purchase for a great price,5
bought this phone and received it today and im returning it tomorrow first of all i got a black one not a white the screen in the front is lifting off and the battery bulging out the back very disappointed,1
only have had a few days yet but arrived with no scratches on the screen or body looks new seems to be working great will update if any problems happen but right now really really happy with my purchase thank you,5
this phone is a total piece of crap why scam people by lying about the product you cant record or watch videos the microphone does not work and the bluetooth does not connect if it does not work then do not sell it,1
this was a great purchase i have received telephone less than  hours after placing the order i like the link of the battery googles hands free option and the speed of the camera i also like the shaking the camera comes on for quick response,5
would love to use phone but unable to unlock the network have tried multiple times different ways but nothn and always said no unable to read sim card even when inserted nothing happens at all can anybody help me would definetly add  stars,1
best price for longest battery life this is my second xt i tried the iphone  plus and the battery life was half at best but the screen was easier to see in the sun which doesnt matter if the battery dies,5
used this for parts to replace the screen of the republic wireless version just as cheap as a screen replacement plus now i have an extra battery speaker mic etc put the bad screen on this phone and the kids used it until it completely stopped working great phone,5
love the phone have had issues with the speakers though not always but it tends to make peoples voices sound all muffled almost like theyre eating during the call i got some ear buds wmic to fix the issue and have no other issues since,3
i just got this phone in the mail the other day and i am very phrased with it im very happy that this phone has the quadcore processor i never not had it lag not even once not to mention the new operating system its flawless its seriously with every penny,5
i needed parts to fix my drowned motog the new led screen was  and this phone only  i used the parts from the new phone to fix my old phone plus i now have a new battery as well repairs were easily accomplished in less than  minutes with youtube,5
if you want a prepaid phone and you dont wanna be in debt to apple this phone is so great update i bought this phone and when i first bought i did love it however i oughtgrew this one and ended up getting an apple product for my birthday its a great budget tho,4
this phone is great its fast solid and easy to set up i have already recommended it to others at this price its even less then getting a similar phone with a contract and paying insurance every month and a  deductible love the verizon prepay option as well,5
i love this phone i have bought this phone for the th time since that it is rather inexpensive it lasts for about  years and gets glitchy but the format is great i want to buy a huge box and just have backs ups to this phone,5
i switched from the samsung galaxy s mini to this guy its pretty awesome many ringtones and awesome wallpapers come installed on the phone loving it the display is very clear and the touch screen is very nice and accurate,5
the phone is awesome but beware that if you live in the country your phone might go into the roaming mode and not the extended network that you need to make and receive calls unfortunately i had to return this and get a verizon contract phone,3
best smartphone for the money seriously less than  and it is in serious competition with the top phones for me i am so happy i got this phone and will stay out of the iphone frenzy i love my moto g and saving money,5
i cant say enough about the moto g its not the highest selling unit at motorola for no reason read the reviews on tech sites but this phone is hands down a great bargain price v product you cant go wrong with this phone i have two,5
from the beginning i had problems with this phone it would constantly freeze up trying to use it and the longer i have had it the worse it has gotten at this point it is unusable it has froze and locked up completely,1
i love my phone very hi tech for a great affordable price just when i sent pictures texts it shows still sending it takes about  to  hours to receive or longer still looking for a solution but i love itit features are very nice got my money worth,4
this phone is awesome i like functional phones without all the fancy bells and whistles motorola phones has always been reliable and sturdy this one is no less it has all the features i want in a phone and some i dont use,5
its a really awesome phone i would recommend this phone to anybody who is in search of a really good budget phone its phenomenal and preforms such tasks as searching the web youtube and getting on various social medias effortlessly,5
work awesome i even drop it in the lake near my grandparents home my rd day of having it and when swimming for it and it still works great only recommendation is to buy your own charger charger that comes with overheats easily,5
a lot of bang for the buck the best phone in this price range by far ive had this for about a month and absolutely no complaints even when im on data its just as fast as on wifi looking for a great phone this is it,5
love this phone great for the price  im so glad i got it  i recommend this phone for any one who cant afford to pay  or  bucks it works just like a galaxy or iphone  i am able to download a lot more apps than a reg pre paid like straightalk,5
this phone will get u through the day without a stutter or lag battery life should get u through a good whole days work and performance well lets just say its better than amy other lower end android phone ,4
i purchased this because i wanted to use verizons prepaid plan however they would not honor this particular phone so i had to return it and ended up getting the moxo x and a contract reviews ive read tell me the g is a great little phone though,4
the moto g from verizon wireless prepaid is the best phone i had i love how google gives you  gigs for two years free the battery last me almost two days on a single charge the phone is a lot better than my samsung galaxy s that i have with virgin mobile,5
battery wont charge after only using it for  months i know its a prepaid phone but id expect it to last longer than  months amazon wont accept returns and i dont know how to get a hold of the seller,1
the service with amazon was great however the product is another problem i have had so much trouble with this phone since i got it it automatically resets most of my features dont work like my camera and gallery very disappointed with moto g phone,1
it came out of the box not working right and has a cracked screen i tried to make an exchange but could only be offered a refund to a card that is no longer working now i need the phone for work purposes and im stuck with a broken one thanks for nothing,1
great camera fast response screen size just right with great color and its really sharp i got the other one httpwwwamazoncomgpproductblcngrieutfcampcreativecreativeasinblcngrlinkcodeshrtagjustckem,5
has apps like nfl mobile that you can not uninstall and uses data in the back ground even though you turn it off phone eats through your data with these apps that turn them selves on and run in the back ground,1
its an awesome smart phone and didnt cost  dollars excellent cameras too i bought it for a pay as you go phone for only  dollars a month for unlimited text and talk does great and is on verizon so no problems getting service,5
could not use this phone as it came locked and couldnt get it unlocked had to send it backi have bought the same phone before two of them and no problemsloved the phones but scared to buy another one until i receive notice that the problem has been fixed,1
bought this phone for my husband i have the same phone and he previously had the same phone but this one hungary i bought doesnt work properly hangs up on phone calls a min through the conversation etc etc,2
its not a galaxy  but for if i lost this one id buy another immediately the best part is i will never have to set foot in a verizon store again also the gorilla glass is fantastic i do wish it was gb but its  dollars,5
love this phone fast processing speed and high speaker volume no memory slots but ease of use and add ons to customize use won me over ive had  or  already bought one for son and daughter with a few breakage mishaps and replacements still love this phone,5
i have to say this phone does it all and it was a gift and i really love it it has so much on it and is easy to use and im still learning how much it does do and i am in my s and its easy and great pictures and all you could want,5
fast clear phone this thing works flawlessly the screen is gorgeous amazon video and netflix are crystal clear the sound is so so with the speaker being on the back i bought another just in case someone needs an emergency phone great investment,5
not a bad phone enjoyed my optimus  a little more to be honest but the phone is nice cons are the battery life is pretty bad if you play any games or surf the web usually dies shortly after  hour work day,4
finally  a pre paid phone that actually works sound is perfect  duplex works as good if not better than others fast processor  no lag very sensitive to touch  good battery life  everyone likes the sound quality on the other end of the line highly recommended,5
this is one of the best phones i have owned and it has a decent camera especially for the price the battery lasts twice as long as any samsung or lg phone of higher price verizon service is very strong,5
used as a wifi device and it very easy to avoid verizon in the phone altogether great sharp screen and my seller had a charger come with it so that was great a great buy  for a phone that can outdo a  one a great bargain,5
this is the best prepaid phone ever from all the other prepaid phones ive used none of them compare to this one of course this one has some flaws but small ones i havent really had any major issues with it,4
love love love this phone its been the best one i have used it doesnt drain the battery to fast and quality of the camera is excellent the only con id say is there is no sd card slot other than that its better than an iphone,5
powerful great smartphone and a great price well made this was a replacement for one i dropped in a parking lot and i didnt have a cover so it received a small crack this time i also purchased the motorola flip shell so at least the glass will be protected,4
like the phone a lot still in the learning stage on how to use itonly had this  weeks now had a simple phone before this maybe  months later will give it a five star when i master this lol phone works great otherwise,4
im sure the phone is great but im not happy with verizon even though the phone is set up specifically for verizon prepaid plan verizon would not allow me to activate it on my current prepaid plan so i returned it,3
i managed to transfer the ex verizon phone to trac phone prepaid service and it has been very reliable although the lack of storage is irritating on november   the cell phone upgraded to android  from android  and it works great,4
it got here faster than they said it would which made me very happy and i love this phone i have yet to find anything i dont like about it i switched from the lg optimus l from metro pcs and while that was a decent phone i like this one so much better,5
works great i just got to get use to it works great watching movies and playing games on it i have to get use to text and clinking over while on the phonestill learning the battery last all day which is great,4
i am very happy with the quality of product on my hand considering the priceit does what i need most of the time  browsing music games social media callstext for sure the only thing i miss is expandable memory,5
its decent and gets the job done for its price if it was any other carrier in the entire world you would have more customization options such as being able to unlock it however verion is not a fan of letting you get more then they wish you to have,3
i have a razr maxx quad core  years old i purchased a moto g its nicer faster and better software and i will be able to beet my contract smartphone down from  a month to  dollars a month with the moto g prepaid,5
terrible it couldnt connect to wifi and kept dropping the signal forcing me to use the data plan verizon customer service was terrible and made me wait on the line for hours avoid this phone and provider at all costs,1
i love this phone i bought it through amazon because it was cheaper than walmart i bought this phone and a case for  bucks and the phone at walmart is  and they dont have phone cases so this was a great deal we have prepaid so it works out very pleased,5
well for a month the phone was working fine but after that the battery was being drain for some reason i am enjoying it though just concern about the battery which doesnt come out to be replaced but its the right size for me the display is outstanding,4
i purchased this phone to use as my main cell phone had to be in for repair it is a wonderful phone for a great price i think i will keep this one as my main one since it has more app options then the windows phone good battery life as well,5
honestly this is the absolute best phone i have purchased so for motorola has definitely gained a new loyal customer this phone can do just about everything i absolute love it  and its bigger than i expected it to be,5
purchased this phone it a rush cause my lg was horrible however after a week i was so impressed dont feel the need to upgrade most of my friends have apple phones and constantly compliment this motorola cant go wrong with this purchase,5
would be nice if verizon would update these phones to windows  before shipping them even now i await the cyan update that will give use of cortana what a joke that this not posted in product description verizon has really dropped the ball on this,4
took a week or so to figure it out but wow doubt i would ever go back to android if youre an app person it may not be for you but as a phone camera navigator personal assistantits crazy good,5
camera is top notch windows os is intuitive and fast and everything is large and dont have to spend time pecking small icons only downside is not as many apps but that is growing all the time as market share grows and its a nokia so its built like a tank,5
i love this phone great reception and sound lots of free programs great camera battery life much improves over the  only have to charge it every two days the navigation program is better then tom tom,5
great screen good performance battery would have been better charging speed would have been better great gaming great for videos will be much better with windows phone  very capable phone which makes windows phone app store look lackluster,5
i have had this phone for less than  months and the screen is already going out it will flicker off and only come back on if it is bumped this is a repairable issue but the repair costs as much as i payed for the phone,1
phone quit working after a few weeks and amazon will not stand by the product they sold me so why would i ever want to buy anything on amazon again i wont unless they decide to stand behind the defective device they sold me,1
has windows phone  which is old and does not have cortana the siri type voice activated everything wait for a better operating system to be installed on it very disappointing wait for windows phone ,1
this windows phone disapoints me i thought i was getting the best phone in the world but this phone is a piece of junkits game selection is poor it barely has anyit is just an overly priced piece of junk dont get it,1
i keep finding things i like about this phone the camera is great the voice quality is great and the reception always seem good g speed is excellent it is a bit on the large side but youd have to live with a smaller screen if you downsized it,5
this phone arrived quickly and in good condition my only issue if i were to mention one is that it didnt have the little tab that holds the sim card fortunately i bought it to replace another icon so i had one on hand other than that no complaints,4
i found a true premium phone the windows phone operating system is as intuitive as can be and the build quality of the nokia icon is just fantastic equaling if not surpassing apples iphone  awesome phone,5
its annoying when a model is advertised and another is shipped to you by the way i paid for sphl and got sphlt the t difference has a bigger effect than you can imagine otherwise phone came in very good cosmetic condition and works fine,3
i love this phone great condition especially for the price defenetly a great buy says condition  but it looks  to me came in  days early the only downside was no shipping details bit not a big deal since i was surprised with an ealy shippment i love it,5
i received the phone earlier than expected by  days this was a major plus also the phones condition looked brand new no flaws no issues at all i am very happy with this phone grade a service met and exceeded all expectations thank you,5
arrived fast was like brand new just with a couple of details on the side but not big deal really smooth battery life acceptable came with a chinese wall charger not the original its a great deal for this price recommended,4
phone had one little chip in the top right corner and the battery life is horrendous i wish they would have provided me with a charged battery as well other than that i am thoroughly impressed and pleased with this purchase,4
consistently drops calls for no reason battery goes dead in a  hour period with very little use will be returning this piece of junk the older versions of the samsung flip phones much more reliable battery lasted days or more and cost ,1
do not waste your money on this phonecompany that sold it i purchased it and when i tried to activate it i couldnt it had been used and previously registered with verizon by original purchasertherefore i could not activate it,1
replaced a broken verizon phone that was not eligible for an upgrade easy activation via verizon after purchase no activation fees with assignment of same  on sameexisting contract plan basic flip phone,5
simplicity is the real name for the gusto  i wanted a phone that is a freaking phone and thats it the gusto is my new hero i hear a noise i open the phone and someone says hello now thats simplicity,5
this phone has horrible sound my gusto  was great there is a lot of echoing and interference noise my friends are always complaining i get a lot of feedback noise very disappointed but cannot afford to buy another one,2
arrived quickly and in great condition but because it is windows i cannot download certain apps i was used to like snapchat for example the tiles are interesting though and make it easy to locate things,3
its the best phone on the market replaceable battery micro sd megapixel camera thats only beaten by the lumia  megapixel camera infra red widows pone  devpre amazing screen and its light as a feather cost me less than ,5
do not buy this phone the operating system is very out dated at least half of the apps you try to download arent compatible none of the food orderingdelivery apps work spectrum tv doesnt work msg go doesnt work turbo tax doesnt work just too name a few,2
phone works great fast shipping did have a pin sized divit like chip in the glass but overall in excellent condition and functionally works great put it in an otter box so it doesnt matter thank you for a great phone  had it  days so far and no problems,4
pleasant buying experience great product fast shipping very smooth transaction didnt put up a review right away wanted to use the product a while and make sure of the quality as you can tell i am very satisfied thanks again,4
i expected the phone to come in garbage condition or have some sort of virus the phone has worked flawlessly since my purchase the battery life is outstanding the longest battery life ive ever gotten out of a phone  would by again,5
exactly what i wanted just what i had hoped it would be was in pretty darn good shape for a used one took right to verizon store where they were able to simply insert a new sim card yeah we are happy and showed up when they said it would  bonus,5
screen flickers and the top half of screen is darker than bottom half once it goes completely dead and i plug it into the charger the screen constantly flickers and i have a hard time getting it to power back on,3
bought this as a cheap replacement for my boyfriends droid its a very simple smart phone has lots of glitches and as an iphone user would totally hate it he just uses it for fantasy football and phone calls so yeah it works,3
had this phone for a  months love it long battery life  quick response ease of use much better then my friends iphone had droid x prior to this phone im a big motorola fan all have been great phones,5
overall phone seems great motorola should have either left it at gb storage or included an sd card slot youre really only getting approximately  gb usable storage which sucks if it werent for that they would get stars will update if i see it necessary,4
mom bought me this phone to replace my other phone and it came and wont respond to my sims card try to get a replacement but just got a refund instead and stuck with a phone that doesnt work if i could give no stars i would,1
great phone for the money i am happy with this phone is a replacement and i am verry happy with this phone and will buy the next one i buy will be an up grade love it great phone happy hampton virginia man,5
so far i love this phone though it is an older phone as pointed out by the verizon tech who helped me activate it it was also much easier on the wallet the one i received looked brand new activation cost me nothing  ,5
i had to purchase this phone to replace my ultra which ended up at the bottom of the washing machine i love this phone so far its a tad bulkier than my ultra but i knew that going in as i did my research,5
this has been a very good phone for  years the only problem occurred recently for  days after an update the phone would not hold a charge i ordered an upgrade and the day before my phone came it started holding a charge again,5
this is the phone my husband who is legally blind is use to so we have bought it over and over if and when he breaks his its a sturdy simple phone wish it had an easier way to charge it overall my husband is happy so we all are happy,3
like this phone very much but a couple of things made me only give it  stars purely personnel preferences though eg no analogue display for the clock great phone though  easy to use  set up can not beat it for the price,4
i purchased this product from proxwireless and i initially received a defective phone however all i had to do was mention this to proxwireless and within  days i had a new functioning phone free of charge or hassle,5
good phone for using as a delivery driver there are many times i have to call the person accepting the deliveryso not having to use my personal phone works out for meits only for verizon but for  bucks a month prepaid im getting unlimited calls,5
does everything a cell phone should great battery life decent camera easy set up with verizon great choice for us older folks who just need a phone to make calls send a short text or share a photo very happy with my mo flip phone,5
this was a gift for a yo grandsonhe loved it dad will not allow him to have a smartphoneyet its a nice step up from the beat up hand me down he had for basic texting and calls so far he likes it and it works great,4
i got this phone less than a month ago and its already been through the washer threw it in a bowl of rice plugged it in to charge after leaving it in the rice overnight and it still works perfectly love the simplicity of the phone and how easy it is to navigate it,5
replaced an old phone on a prepaid plan that had a defective screen the gusto  was recommended at verizon very happy with the quality and price easy to transfer original number verizon helped me transfer all my contacts,5
this was the second phone we ordered took them to verizon and none of them could be turned on you said it was a new phonethere was no instructions or warrantee enclosed who are you fooling you should be ashamed of your selves for selling crap like that,1
this didnt work very well at all it constantly reboots itself for no reason you can rarely get through a phone call or text message without it rebooting itself and kicking you out of what you were trying to do,1
this ad did not mention prepaid but it was for a verizon plan i purchased  knowing my husband goes through them very fast i could not activate either one because of the prepaid was not activated for at least  months the company would not let me return them,1
the description says its  per month for  minutes but when you activate it it only lets you use a plan that is unlimited calls and texts for  per month that ends wether you use any minutes or not this is not what i expected or wanted,1
i had a problem with shipping in that i got  of them when i only ordered  so i sent  back and had to pay shipping of which i never got reimbursed i was never charged for the second phone i enjoy the phone and it was exactly what i was looking for,4
the most use friendly phone i bought this for my mother who generally gets very frustrated with the newer smartphones  and she was very happy with this one its a no gimmick phone great for making and receiving calls,5
got it as a disposable phone that i could just put a few minutes on but it turns out id need a plan which would cost considerably more for much more than i needed it for probably a great phone but i donated it to the verizon store,3
i dont believe this phone was really new it couldnt hold a charge by the time i realized a new battery couldnt fix it it was too late to return it i cant recommend this  at least from the vendor i bought from,1
i wanted a small fone to slip in my pocket and i like the fact thats its a flip cover protects the main screen its cute  the plan is cheap in fact i have  gustos it has the same basic features as those touch screen ones do and so so easy to use its a must have,5
this is a nice phone i already had one for three years but i lost it so had to go online and buy a new one i liked it so much that i just went ahead and bought the same phone it does everything i need it to do plus some i love cortana also,5
to tell the truth am very disappointed about the internet connection regarding g it might be my service provider but i checked with my friends and the service works with them just fine i cant get this phone to work g the performance other than that is good,3
love my windows phones unfortunately seller shipped phone with either defective battery or defective on  off button was unlocked but comes up as a tmobile phone didnt realize this was supposed to be refurbished,4
the phone is an unlocked tmobile phone it still say tmobile everywhere but i confirmed with tmobile it is unlocked i did an imei check and it comes clean for all major us carriers as well i will be connecting it to h and will write back if any problems,5
i returned two phones because they were not unlocked he third one was allso locked loos like the advertisement saying unlocked is not true and misleading what a shame i cannot believe amazon could not deliver what i bought,1
my wife loves it not the best phone of course but one of the best for the price screen is very responsive and easy to use no lag or freezes the camera lcd isnt the clearest but im use to my galaxy s with a hd screen but it works just fine,5
after one month this phone quit receiving incoming calls was ready to ship it back to amazon the walmart family plan gents played with this phone for two hours and still couldnt get it to receive calls the problem was a damaged cell tower phone works fine now,5
i bought this phone for my dad and hes really in love with it the so is very confortable to him  he has acces very quickly to all his apps and he has all apps he wants the only problem that we found its camera quality but for him its not a big problem,4
i am quite disappointed in the choice ive made in the purchase of this phone too many challenges even in setting this phone up and time consuming as wellall i can say the only good thing about this phone is the camera will not recommend this to no one ever,1
phone is ok for the price its my mistake that i did not read enough because i thought all phones come with front facing camera nowadays well this one dont i almost returned it but the in law said it will work for her,3
you can not receive any picture mail or group texts you have to convert and do all kinds of things to make it work if it works at all i even had my company it guy try to covert messages and couldnt make it convert group texts or picture messages,2
this phone is worth buying i liked this product and i am using it from last  months i dont have any complain with this phone i will recommend my friend to buy this phone if they are looking for android  range phone it is much better than those phone,4
this phone works well it could use a little more space and note it does not have a front camera would not have bought it if i noticed that  i got it on time for my trip to the caribbean it worked well nokia phones are generally good phones,4
it is broken i bought an cellphone with screen problem tactil its ok but the image turn off and on quickly i live in venezuela and i dont have how to sending back for guarantee i send a email but no response i hope others cellphone have been better,2
i gave this phone as a christmas gift and the power button on the phone broke within a few weeks i am outside tge return window so i am out the cost of the phone this is a well documented problem on the internet for this model,1
hello the phone is locked and requests a code to use it with a sim card other than tmobilei bought this product in order to use it in usa an argentina  please send the unlock code the imei code is  thank you,3
this product came with a charger and a manual it was indeed unlocked and works well in the caribbean on our local networks i love lumias because they are so durable and dont have all the confusing frills of other phones it was a great buy,5
build quality is great but windows kills it this thing crashes me back to the start screen all the damn time  chance you can watch more than  min of a youtube clip before it freezes and you have to start over and good luck using the reddit app,2
bought two of these i was under the impressions that they would both have cortana onboard however my husbands phone was the only one that had the app kind of dissappointed that both werent equipped with the app,4
buy this product a few days ago i received but i feel this phone is used as the display the screem is all scratched it came whit out memory  gb and i feel phone very slow  im a dissatisfied with this purchase,1
good morning gentlemen sincerely i want to say that you bought a cellular nokia lumia  is described which is unlocked and i came to venezuela as t mobile is not my line where the operator is movistar wants  i send me the unlock code,1
i bought the phone  months ago as a spare so i didnt use it until now i found that people i was talking to on the other side cannot hear me even though i could hear them basically its useless and i needed to get a new phone,1
this phone is the worse ever the battery drains within less an hour you need to connect the phone to the power all the time unfortunately i sent it to my sister as a gist and it was very embarrassing to send her such gift otherwise i should have returned it,1
i enjoy this phone very much i use the phone and i use word and excel to keep documents with me i only wish microsoft was going to continue smartphone production and smartphone operating systems i much prefer windows to android and ios operating systems,5
this phone is a great disappointment i cannot access google facebook doesnt work and almost all internet connection is unavailable to me its like this phone has no memory left very dissatisfied,1
love this phone its good and it was unlocked idk why all these people are mad because theres isnt unlocked but mine is and im happy about this phone i needed a new phone because my lgf cracked so i just wanted a cheap nokia and this product is great ,5
exactly as described works great and would have given it  stars but its old tech and all i needed was a temp while my good phone was in for repairs do your research check sim card size carrier suitability,4
phone doesnt freaking turn on i plug in charger sim card battery everything i connect the phone and it vibrate for a second but theres nothing on screen very upset with manufacture for sending me a broken phone will be returning and take business else where,1
good morning gentlemen sincerely i want to say that you bought a cellular nokia lumia  is described which is unlocked and i came to venezuela as t mobile is not my line where the operator is movistar wants then the seller sent the code  recommend to buy,4
great basic phone for calls text and emails shipping was quick it arrived unlocked ready to use i am a window  user so set up for this phone was not a problem for me for me the lumia  provides all the functions i need at a super affordable price,5
this is my first experience with a windows phone previously i had android powered phones there are things i like about both however up to this point my nokia windows phone has been much less aggravating,4
awesome love it should have maybe buy the one that is bigger for the price its a great phone way better than other crap that are way more expensive plus nokia was always a god phone till iphone and samsung killed the market ,5
running windows  great phone but keyboard is glitching up in some apps and covering text entry box avoid updating to windows  if possible phone is surprisingly consistent performancewise despite the relatively low specs,4
nokia lumia  is the best phone for the price i bought  the same phone for my family oversea and for myself i advice to anybody how is interested on nokia lumia with out any histation the phone is  perfect,5
the person i got it for liked it however the battery and charger was looking old and it had a lot of white dust on itits a very light weight phone the phone is a tt unlocked so it worked in the caribbean,4
major shock unlike other lumias including  this one is locked into an obsolete os and refuses to upgrade to win also logos and apps from old carrier interfere with operating popping logos or other wise messing with normal use,1
the phone itself is awesome although when i received my phone its box had a tear and was not sealed the sim card was missing for the phone amazon made this right and i was reimbursed for the sim card the phone is great,5
as for the seller extraordinary i arrive on time the dispatcher took him into custody within the mailbox i recognize them  in terms of product what i needed ideal recommendations to new buyers always read the specifications,5
a piece of crap spend a lot of time and just could not achieve a simple task as to transfer file from a pc first it does not come with a usb cable when i found a usb that fits and connected to pc the pc did not recognize it can someone help,1
great phone all the futures that iphones and galaxies have of course iphone is better but it also cost  times the price microsoft has fewer apps but all the main ones are there facebook whats up viber some games,5
this phone is a piece of s worth maybe  or  dollars defiantly not  the camera sucks wont connect to a wifi network and has a sty g network phone calls are constantly being dropped i have att and never had this kind of problem before i had this phone,1
im about to order a new one ive had this phone for over four years and ive rarely had any problems with it the issues i did have were very minor im sticking with the lumia  because its inexpensive it works well for my needs and i know the phone,5
only had this phone  monthspower button now does not work dropped calls and bad reception on many calls one day i realized i was not getting my texts this was a bad decision so i have now bought another phone,1
works very well looked a little crusty but sold as used no real problems just a little dirty i highly recommend this phone its so much better than the s i had that its incredible use firefox for best browsing on this,5
piece of junk dropped one time in an otterbox and got the black screen of death and of course the return window was up only two days agoonly thing i have ever bought from amazon and was unhappy phone never worked right g was always g very rarely was it g,1
delivery was fast  i really like this phone was easy to have activated but you will need a sim card update sept  five months later  i find it needs a new battery as well as it gets terrible reception even within a mile of a cell tower,4
ive had this for a month or so now and works well im sure there is a way to update the android version but for now it is locked at  my previous s was updated to the top version though this is less twitchy than the newer one,5
the recharging of the phone is terrible battery does not last long have to have the back cover off in order to charge the phone properly then it takes a long time to charge very unreliable and i am disappointed as well in this product,1
horrible choice took it to verizon had it activated and immediately started glitching out the screen constantly scrolls up and is completely unusable very unhappy with my purchase hopefully you dont make the same mistake as i did,1
phone works  but some apps i downloaded some more than once wont work i have to send it back i went to the verizion store they updated the out of date operating system  but it still wont load the apps,2
call quality is very poor people cant understand me also some features that are supposed to work on the s and did on my old s such as video calling dont work on this phone it doesnt make any sense,1
dont waste your money battery life is a few hours a best my phone turns off after three or four hours because the battery is dead but when i place it on the charger there is  battery it also randomly turns off in the middle of phone conversations,1
received the device and was packed well to prevent any damage once received attepted to activate the phone and after spending half a day with verizon took phone into a verizon store was advised the phone was unable to activate waisted too much of my time,1
i am very upset with this product because i have to fix a phone that i have not ever get to use the samsung galaxy s came on for  minutes and then just shut down and would not come on i need my money back,1
back cover is cracked and shattered through out never been dropped very first time it would not transfer from old phone to new phone the plug in cover broke off within  months battery will not hold a charge would not recommend the phone,1
the first phone i received was damaged and i dont believe it was brand new the second one amazon sent was perfect  i could tell from the set up and all the protective coverings that it was brand new  it was an easy exchange and im very happy with the phone ,4
phone came in great condition my girl loves her new phone pretty much we are happy in how great condition the phone however the shipping seems like it took a long time but will recommend to friends and family very easy to activate the phone and everything,4
this was a christmas gift for my wife and after one month of use the phone stopped working the images on the screen started scrolling upward and the whole screen gets distortedim definitely sending this back,1
my phone has been breaking down  months after i received it now when it is fully charged it will die as of today i cant get it to turn on or charge faulty product and i will be looking into getting my money back,1
my phone came exactly as described works great i went to verizon and set it up with their prepaid plan and was up and running in about  minutes i love my new phone i would purchase from this seller again,5
i had the phone in a protective case since the day of purchase the screen is already separating from the backing and samsung says its out of warrant its not even a year old runs slow and has had several malfunctions wont buy again,2
worst phone ever i purchased  and both broke moments out of the box back cover  jack cover screen problems to non functioning phone with in a month i had one of them worked on and it was found to be full of cheep after market parts,1
very worst phone it s said g but is not g this one working g my phone showing e symbol i am try down load facebook showing error i have make a video call really worst anyway i connect to wi fi same problem,1
i love all the accessories that came with the phone the picture quality is great its not too big or too small great tools for everyday use and some fancy extras the battery life is exceptional as well,4
charger port was broken when i received it could only use phone with a verizon small charger not the longer s adapter phone actually came with cost me an additinal  to get fixed disappointed but needed a phone however great price for what i received,2
my new samsung s phone is defective because when i try to turn it on sometimes or put it at the lowest brightness the screen flickers turns green or shuts off its been causing me a problems i would like the seller to email me,2
the phone is fine the battery that came with it however wont hold a charge for a reasonable time amazon should replace it also didnt get a sim card with the phone  had to pay verizon  for the card,3
no problems encountered with orderdelivery unfortunately both phones had software issues unable to factory reset due to screens freezing afraid to reorder for fear of getting another pair of phones with the same problems,1
this phone was the biggest piece of garbage ever the speaker phone never worked the reception is horrible i dont know what is wrong with it but ive used it for a few months and it is never performed properly,1
was really looking forward to updating my old samsung phone and i was a little disappointed with how many problems i have been having with this phone turns off randomly screen doesnt always turn on along with other frustrations,2
phone was in perfect mint condition not a scratch or flaw anywhere phone is works perfectly took it to verizon and had a sim installed with no problems definitely will do business with celluar professor again,5
we love the samsung s it was an amazing deal and shipping was fast and easy we always use amazon for our online shopping it was awesome to receive phone call personally to check on our recent purchase,5
if i could give zero stars i definitely would have alot of problems with sell phone less then a year old and broke the phone originally overheated and wasnt working now i cant get a refund this is really ridiculous,1
i was very wrong with this phone i got a chinese model of samsung s for all those who want to check if it is an authentic samsung mark this code      must arrive in menu to check the authenticity of samsung,1
arrived fast works great with my verizon service i went to the verizon store and they installed the sim card free of charge with no questions didnt change my rate plan verizon also copied over my contacts,5
i would not recommend buying from mobilespree the phones charging port does not work and sd cards do not mount properly i would recommend dishing out the extra cash and buying from whatever company you use verizon t mobile etc,1
great phone absolutely love it  im using straight talk  upgraded from my verizon galaxy s to this s  the transition was unbelievably smooth i just removed my sim  sd cards from my old phone  put them in my new one  never missed a beat would highly recommend ,5
i purchased the black version of this phone and received a brand new phone i purchased this phone and received a phone thats been used there is dirt and tape inside the phones back compartment battery terminals show use,3
item listed as in used  very good condition  phone works fine but the camera lens is all scratched up all pictures come out fuzzy and blurry would not have bought it if i knew the camera was not in good functioning condition,2
the phone is great the only problem was it was suppose to be a new phone and im pretty sure it wasnt it already had screen burn in from the keyboard when turned on and didnt come with the original charger very disappointed with false representation,1
i love this phone it works awesome it was easy to register with straight talk from the instructions that were given all i had to do was get a straight talk verizon sim card i would buy this phone again,5
many times someone may think there is something wrong with their equipment when the problem is the cable connection its too early for me to say how good this cable is but it works good so far i use it to connect my samsung galaxy smartphone to linux my computer,4
ive just receiving device and you download some applications and came off the device and appeared to me the samsung logo on the screen and all the friends lost phone numbers pictures and applications and pin numbers do not recommend anyone try this device,1
this particular phone had an internal problem had to send it back ordered another from another vendor same make and model new phone works perfectly just got a bad one to start i guess great phone if you get a good one but sometimes these things happen,1
had to change my rating after having had the phone for about  months now i am very disappointed as the battery lasts maybe a few hours tops i have to be sure and travel with my charger just to go to work,1
this phone is great and arrived in perfect brand new condition its fast and easy to use it has an awesome camera that takes clear colorful pictures downloads are fast as is retrieving my emails or texting i love this phone,5
ordered for a friend he loved the phone only problem was the charger didnt work must have been defective this is why the four star rating wasnt a biggy he had another charger plug was why no one was contacted,4
i knew it was a large phone before i bought it but i wanted a large display for internet acess it is on the border of being too large for a phone after you put a good case on it but everything else that is great,4
we purchased this samsung galaxy s with great results it arrived early and just as described will definitely purchase from this seller againsamsung galaxy s gv verizon g lte smartphone w mp camera  black,5
this phone has been a great upgrade from the s my provider is verizon prepaid which i was able to set up online with no problem since i do not do a lot of streaming etc i chose the g data plan with rollover the s meets and exceeds my expectations,5
phone was still locked to verison i had to sort out unlocking the myself the portable mobile hot spot feature appears to have been permanently disabled by verizon even after unlocking the phone the feature is still blocked asides this the phone is as good as new,3
i kept this phone for about  months got to the point i had to get a better phone the phone kept freezing up and was extremely slow even after i would turn off and back on i ended up buying the s world of difference,2
well phone is is decent shape but thats it i wish i could put a pic of what i actualy recieved not in factory box as pictured  inste a d of  charger and no ear buds period definantly false advertising but i g you just get ripped off some times,1
this phone is not verizon compatible as described verizon was mentioned in the description at least  times very misleading and extremely annoying the phone seemed to be absolutely finejust not verizon compatible,1
bought mine brand new and it works as it should not the persons fault but the battery does die faster than the knock off brands and it gets a bit warmer than my liking other than that so far it works great ,5
i really like it but i had it less than a month and the little door that is over the place where you put the charger in came off now it is not waterproof any longer i would expect an older model phone this expensive would at least last longer than a few weeks,3
i ordered a new phone it looks like i got a refurbished one the charge stays only for one hour battery is drying soon  and it will take  hours to battery full i am not happy with this product it stuck frequently not so happy with this phone,1
can not beat this phone for the price replaced my galaxy s that went out after year and half not as fast as the s but close enough that i dont miss it only have a couple of graphics intensive games but is handling without issue,5
love love love it arrived quick and it works great love the fact that you can wave your hand or any object in front of it when phone is locked and the time comes on great featureamong many others camera takes really good pix too,5
after many cell phones of other brands i decided to go back to motorolla i love this phone while i wish it had a few more features its a perfect smart phone for the thrifty phone buyer comparable to the two leading phone names but at a fraction of the price,5
best phone ever  love the talk to me feature  i dont even need to touch my phone anymore its the best feature ever i used to love the iphone but ill never go back to an iphone again  this phone has changed my life for the better,5
so far so good i like it the only thing that caused a little problem is i had to order a nano sim card i was not able to simply take my old sim card out and insert it in the new phone i will try and update several months from now,4
so this was a better of the used phones but the charging port was loose when trying to charge then the battery was getting warm i understand it may be used but maybe little more checking into complete check,3
outstanding product does everything i need i couldnt see spending twice the price to get an apple product no contract and unlocked is the only way to fly phone feels solid not like a piece of plastic email and web browsing are a snap calendar is useful,5
i enjoy getting the best phones from a couple yrs back for  the original price this was a great phone and its about as close to stock android as you can get wo having to load it yourself i enjoyed it better than my old iphone,5
great phone until i dropped it fast clean decent price no bloatware unless you count some of the moto stuff like the hand motions and the moto version of siri both of which i found useful especially the shake for flashlight,4
the screen on this phone is really fragile the performance and battery life are great  ive been quite satisfied by the phone other than this but its definitely not up to snuff on durability im going to be replacing mine,3
great phone if youre looking for a great budget friendly phone cant go wrong here great build quality and features however once i updated to android m i lost some key features such as motorola assist  boo,4
everything was perfect i got the whitebamboo combo and it is completly unlock device xt sold and shipped by amazon this is the best phone you can get right now a completely unlock device go ahead and give it a try,5
great phone i have moto x st generation and love it bought this one for my wife and she is happy with it first charge held for  full days with very moderate use and camera update fixed focusing issue all the rest is great as it should be,5
great phone for the price very good screen resolution love the ability to look at messages etc without having to unlock phone first too bad it doesnt have memory card ability but still a great phone,5
just received phone few hours ago but was very impressed that the phone was exactly as stated in sell information set up went smoothly and moto x nd genis a great step up from moto g i couldnt be happier with purchase great valve,5
the phone arrived in flawless condition appeared brand new this is now officially the best phone ive ever owned and the cheapest ive ever paid for one love it would definitely purchase from warehouse deals again,5
exceptional i used the previous version of this and it was great now this one had a problem and i sent it back for repair i called the number in order to know what was wrong with it and they told me that they cant tell that sounds strange to me,5
i love everything about this phone except when i brought it to verizon to have it activated they told me it was a locked phone boooooo not what i ordered update ive since received a new moto and its exactly what ii ordered thank you amazon,4
this phone is a piece of crap i have purchased  hoping that the broken headphone jack was just luck but the jack broke on my second phone immediately after the return warranty was up if you want to use headphones with this phone ever do not consider buying,1
really like this phone but ive been through three of them and charging issues are absolutely endemic it invariable gets so bad that i have to replace the thing on warranty sadly if you cant keep a phone charged its of little use small but important oversight,3
this phone breaks easily theres a reason they stopped selling it not to mention the description didnt say that unlocked does not mean verizon compatible i wasted my money on a rubbish phone that i couldnt use,2
this is a great phone others have mentioned its flaws in the screen but that can be protected by after market glass shields love the pure android experience camera isnt the best but this is a great phone,4
two months and  days after purchase the moto x nd gen has ceased working waiting to hear from seller i have waited  days for a call back super bummed no damage just gets so far into start up screen goes black i do not recommend this seller or this device,1
awesome phone bought one of these in  then changed it for the next gen version pure edition now my mom is using it battery performace dropped drastically as expeted but besides that it still working very very good,5
no sd card slot phone is a pos you cannot expand the memory unless you by a memory stick for this phone the memory stick will always be attached to the bottom of the phone stupid design pos,1
it comes in a generic box that scares me but when i open the box all was happines this phone is beautiful works great and comes in perfect like new conditions im happy with it only a problem is the att variant cant unlock bootloader,4
for a little while a couple weeks after i first started using it the auto rotate didnt work i went online and saw it is not uncommon problem solution is to whack phone hard against your thigh battery life doesnt seem too great otherwise it is ok phone,5
this is great fast phonebut have an issue with dinamicspeople couldnt hear me while i am on speacker alsowhen i was using it to talk on a skypewas really bad hearing this phone has problem with speakers all other functions are great,4
good cellphone for the price just the camera is not as good as you expect from a modern phone when it is a bit dark the camera just take bad pictures and also it is difficult to focus but i had already known it before buying so this is not a problem,5
this is a nexus dont let the name fool you motorola made their bloody masterpieces in  the moto x and the droid turbo the x is amazing just make sure you get the  gigabyte version the  comes with  useable gigs ,5
love it but poor battery life im not a heavy user but at the end of the day ive got less than  also now less than a year from new it wont charge from the wall outlet only directly from a computer or portable battery,5
ordered through open group wireless and they sent me a xt model which doesnt match the description at all the xt is the european  chinese version which doesnt have the correct basebands to do tmobile lte beware of buying through open group wireless,1
only had it a week but so far i love it not too large and not too small about a quarter inch longer than my samsung tundra pro and same width  has more built in memory so down loads and updates are much faster im still learning new functions but still love it,5
great phone and company is super helpful but for me after  batteries i can say that the phone isnt great as far as battery lifehrs tops before u have to charge back up i give it   only because the company is great to work with,4
the phone was in excellent condition i transferred data and sim chip works perfectly in fact it works better than my previous one that i bought from att ill never buy one from the att store again thx for a great phone,5
the battery dont last much ill try everything to save battery but with  or  calls the battery start to drain almost to the   of life i charge it to  and with in a couple hours the battery gets so low again thank you,2
i upgraded from the samsung galaxy s and i am impressed with the alpha i dont use any of the samsung health perks of the phone but its lightning fast takes good pictures and has great battery life in comparison to my prior phone,5
the phone sometimes freezes on me and now the battery wont charge i hope this phone doesnt give me more problems i guess ill have to order another battery isnt it somethingjust as soon as my return date expires i run into problems with this phone,1
huge improvement from my old phone i love the size super light and fits in my womens jeans tiny pockets great display speedy performance and updated to run lollipop everything i wanted out of my next smartphone purchase,5
i went from an iphone s plus to this phone its an awesome phone if you want something smaller and more compact this is the phone to get i was always an iphone user but then came across samsung and i am hooked best phone ever,5
have had this phone for  months it now powers off when it chooses not all phone calls inbound are recieved it chooses who it wants to recieve a text from and and send to and the touch screen is now not working very well very dissapointed in my purchase,1
its okay for the price but im having several problems with the camera  i have to keep resetting the phone for the camera to work ive lost all my pictures notes text messages and contacts by resetting the phone,3
the phn shuts off on its oni have to take the battery out bn put it back in for it to come back onit cuts off random ly would love to return it for another but dont want to be totally with b out a phn while waiting what can i do,1
i bought one a few months ago and it looked brand new even though it was listed as very good since my previous order went so well i assumed this one would as well but the phone is very scratched on the corners it looks terrible,3
in the description it said it would show signs of use like minor scratches and honestly theirs not a single scratch its in perfect condition and it came right on time im in love with my mega  i highly recommend your search stops here two thumbs up for sure,5
i had this phone for almost  months and everything was going fine then the other day the battery died and now it wont turn on or charge at all its pretty much a paper weight now had to purchase a new phone definitely not satisfied,2
i purchase this samsung galaxy mega  phone and it is not working i purchase a charger charged the phone and it is still not coming on i would like a workable phone to replace this phone or my monies back,1
i have had my phone for almost  yearslove it camara quality an that it the only reason it get  stars the price here is to much i got my from metro pcs at  total because i got a mail in rebate of new not used so why pay ,4
just as fast as the note phones because it lacks the unnessesary features the phone is not too big but its not a pocket phone and you will not misplace it easily it took me a whole  hours to master the device whereas i never mastered my not ,5
still my fav phone for however long its been out this particular phone being faster than even my last one so hell yea sprint provider being picky with this phone needing to be a sprint phone is the only slight drawback,5
the phone vibrates and then turns off ive tried swapping the battery with a new battery cleaning my phone of apps etc my husband has the same phone and his battery life is x mine and doesnt experience any of these issues,1
i am sending this item back to the seller it would not connect with the sprint network in richmond va it never worked and i was unfortunately forced to purchase a younger phone in order to continue with my service,1
nice phone works great however i didnt know that by purchasing this phone that i would get caught up in a two year contract by the carrier i have order a phone before and this never happen maybe it has something to do with the carrier,4
i ordered this as a replacement phone and i honestly was expecting something to be wrong with the phone or not be as expected but that was not the case the phone only needed a sim card and activated smoothly seller was great,5
i have been using this phone for a year now i like it a lot but i do have trouble hearing on it sometimes that might be do to the otterbox but can be frustrating other than that i love the phone and its functionality,5
i bought refurbished enjoyed the phone for about a week and then it stopped working i absolutely love the note  so after i receive my money back i think i am going to try again and get like new from a different seller,2
this is my first smart phone i really like it but i agree with the people who say battery life isnt that great thats not a hardship for me cuz im almost always able to plug in but i think a person who is constantly on the go and on the phone wouldnt be happy,5
this was a great phone in   stars while google owned motorola and released timely updates to this device now that lenovo owns it software releases havent been good and i would rate it a high  or low ,5
this phone is amazing love the speed over my last phone wish there was expandable sd slot but overall love the phone nice resolution beautiful display fast processor as well overall great phone highly recommend,5
i love my phone love the moto x is fast the camera is amazing and i cannot thing of a single thing i dont like even down to the way the phone fits into my hand that little curve on the back its just great best phone ive ever owned,5
great looking phone that can take a beating best value on the market until the s drops my sister has a gold s and this is better in every way besides the camera the samsung cameras are marginally better but this one gets the job done with hdr on,5
phone was brand new cant beat this deal for a cent plus shipping phone last all day for me i am a moderate internet user semi heavy texter and light caller excellent reception on verizons networki work for them,5
overall a good phone but lacks some features available on samsung such as voicemail management and an instant mute button for media settings much better purchasing thru amazon than directly thru verizon,4
the moto x nd gen is a great andriod phone i am a big iphone fan so for me to say its a good phone is really saying something there are a fee things im not a fan of but all in all its a great phone,4
phone is spectacular has the same specs as an s without that awful touchwhiz skin the moto voice works better than any other voice recognition software including siri also the voice recognition software can be activated when the phone is in standby,5
this is my second motorola phone this phone is definitely faster than my old droid razr maxx motorola released a software update a day ago and i am very pleased to see the changes make the phone more userfriendly,5
i thought this phone was kind of light and not very sturdy i would recommend the droid turbo for motorola this is just not their best phone while it is cheaper and good for a budget it is not something you will enjoy long term,2
sorry does not have same specs as last reviewer stated only gpu and cpu are same moto x has smaller battery worse camera worse quality screen not water resistant no fingerprint scanner no heart rate monitor,2
the phone sent me back to when i first got a phone it was like having a razr with touchscreen i couldnt get regular apps and the internet was wack other than that the battery life was decent and it never broke even though i only had it for about a month,3
it is very difficult to open the edge of the back case is butted up against the screen glass battery went in fine would not allow setup until sim was installed so of course when i had to reopen again to install sim the screen cracked,2
once i turned it on it worked like magic and its been working great since i really like it and its a cool phone my only problem is the battery lowers a bit when you use it but it makes sense really but either way its a good phone,5
i bought this phone as a starter phibe for my  year old this item says it was a no contract tmobile phone however it did not work with my tmobile sim card i even called tmobile customer service and they could not help me this was a big lie and disappointment,1
if you want a smart phone that makes perfect phone calls and has awesome battery life  this is it you cannot get a better smartphone for the price you are paying i keep this phone as a backup and it has always been extremely reliable,5
i dont need all the bells and whistles of a high end smart phone  just calling texting and pics the software didnt take too long to get the hang of i love the word assistant for texting you cant beat it for the price,4
the phone is not user friendly the camera doesnt have a zoom in option at least i cant find it the voice activated doesnt recognize what you ask it for it always saying i didnt get that no matter how many times you say it just not what i thought it would be,2
phone is defective cant dial out cant receive calls unless im hooked up to voicemail and it cant access internet i had the nokia  and am extremely disappointed with this phone looks like i bought an appointment calendar and alarm clock instead of a phone,1
i bought a unlocked version it was stated as new but what i got was a phone full of scratches and ther where about  contactswhen i tried to change my simits asking for unlock codei got this phone stating that it was unlocked versioni am totally disappointed,1
this is an exccellent price it is a prepaid no contract phone which is what i have and i pay only  unlimited everything g or they have talk and text for  a month its a month to month with no contracts love it its the best deal out there,5
this is a very great affordable smart phone works with tmobile go smart metro pcs bright spot ultra mobile and other companies that run on tmobile its good to use as a starter phone or as a temporary one and is really worth the price,4
a few months in and my husbands first time around with a smart phone has been a success though he isnt sure how to do much he really loves that he can speak his texts otherwise he would be there all day camera is easy to use as well for him,5
item did not come with tmobile sim which was expected also it did not arrive in a typical t mobile box so not sure about authenticity the sound clarity specifically when you want to use speaker phone is quite poor,1
i bought this as a beginner smartphone for my children it runs with the windows operating system my kids really like this phone they have facebook on it and it takes good pictures and videos theyre pleased and this pleases me,5
good windows phone pictures come out great only con i have come across so far it continuously hooks onto data in the background if you have limited data access you might want to be careful having wifi around is great overall good buy for the money,4
its a very good phone for the price if you mostly just talk text and use the most common applications it doesnt have a lot of bells and whistles on it compared to many of the higher priced smartphones out there today but all the basic applications are there,4
phone was defective judging by other reviews i would stay far away from this company andor phone the return has been a hassle and i still have thisbphone that doesnt work i had to but a different one disappointed,1
its that i dont like its that it is not unlocked phonethey playwith words the phone is unlocked from a phone plan but not unlocked from tmobile you have to use tmobile or get it unlocked to use and another carrieri like the phone and ,2
good phone but windows phones arent my favorite since theyre limited in function no front facing camera was also a down side i returned it when i got a great deal from tmobile on an lg l android for the same price,3
terrible i purchased this phone twice from the seller galaxy tech llc the first time around the phone froze a day later the second time around it froze a few months later this is totally not brand new phones as described,1
the vendor did their best to stand by the product but after three phones i realized that not all samsung galaxy come from the same place bought a galaxy from cricket and had no problems phone is great,1
i just received this yesterday i originally but the s in  and love it so happy to have found a replacement for mine that originally died its a great smartphone easy to use and does everything i need,5
i barely have a month using my samsung s its very fast i love the camera and its options  hd qualitythe only problem is that it cqme with too many apps that i cant desinstall using the phone memory in apps im not interested in,5
ok so when my  year old seen itit almost seemed to good to be true type of deal i told him to do a little research on what kind  reviews he did and this phone was the one in the picture  great condition  no bad price,5
phone fell and i took the liberty of opening it up only to find corrosion on one of the boards now the camera isnt working the screen rotation not functioning and the microphone only works with the speaker on,1
unhappy with the product led lights on top not visible usb cable  outlet plug dont work together need to use a different usb cable with same plug or vice versa not worth the delivery wait im one unhappy customer,2
the phone seemed fine for about  months then the screen started having dead areas so i could not enter my pin or phone numbers etc sometimes the screen is completely dead now it has no warrantysamsung galaxy s sghi usa gsm unlocked cellphone gb frost white,1
the phone comes on and everything but it refuses to read sim card seems like an issue with many ss now i dont know what to do with phone this is ridiculous youtube gives a solution to the problem but its temporary smh,1
the phone i received was faulty from day one and kept shutting off he knowingly sold me a defective phone and didnt care i ask for a refund or new phone and was totally ignored because he didnt care please do not make this mistake and buy his junk phones,1
the only reason i am even giving this a star is because one is required i bought  of these and none of them work i would have been upset if only one was not working nut both that is the worst thing ever,1
hi guys i really liked my order and appreciated the delivery time my only complaint is the battery doesnt take in maximum  hours if i charge it and the phone get very very hot when using it such as when watching the youtube videos thank you for your service,4
i bought this phone to send it to ethiopia but when they get it did not work because something missingi am so mad right now since i lost my  dollar but it thought me lesson not to buy phone or even an electronic from amazon,1
just turned it on and im getting a security warning message saying unauthorized changes have been made please restart i have and it restarts with a short recovery message but the error from knox keeps appearing,1
bought two of them and my husband had no problem with his but mine had all kinds of bugs and since i threw away all my info i ended up throwing the phone awaytoo because verizon could not help me with it either,1
well i thought it was an okay phone no frills but it worked fine and got the job done except for the fact that here  months later the phone is dead i didnt expect it to be an amazing phone but i did expect it to last at least a year this is ridiculous,1
great phone exactly what i needed for work and leisure not too big not too small and has a stylus it was unlocked so i was able to use a sim card from a network provider in a different country just ensure the network frequency matches that of the phone,5
i had a galaxy j  version this phone does not compare the processor is definitely much slower it is a note  means  duhhh so this is what you get when you purchase a phone that was manufactured in  i still love samsungs though,3
yes it did  wonderful phone  i made a mistake when i bought the first one i should have looked for a phone that works with my network you cant buy any of the phones you have to find one that is compatible with your network,5
all functions are working it looks good as promised im having one issue with transferring data to pc i seem to have solved that by changing a setting in the windows usb driver for the galaxy but still testing to ensure it continues to work,4
best phone ever i would recommend anyone who is having second thoughts to buy this phone without hesitation you wont be disappointed the samsung galaxy note  rise beyond my expectations wow is all i can say,5
this phone freezes it doesnt allow me to download pictures it even freezes when i try to download pictures from facebook and sometimes the screen even turns black id recommend purchasing a phone from your carrier,1
i just received my phone less than  hrs agoi am excited that it looked brand newnot only that well packaged also transferred sim out of old phone and it worked immediatelyso this seller is cool with me,5
love the phone stylus and features its a note  nothing old about it still keeps up with other new phones in the market was in immaculate condition almost new i sketchdraw a lot so the wacom digitizer was the biggest feature for me,5
great product have yet to check if its unlocked yet but its working with my att sim card and it comes with android  everything is in its original packaging like you would see if you purchased this cell phone new from a retail store,5
the vendor first sent unlocked att network phone i use tmobile i could make calls but it keep reseting to att i contacted vendor told him what happen and without hesitation he sent me a tmobile galaxy note,5
what ppl need to realize that this is a fake phone the realize version sim card n memory slot is on opposite side of each other a lot of features dont work please know what u is buying before u purchase this item,1
i tried ordering a case to go with the phone but you had old info on a lost credit card so every thing got messed up i tried to correct the problem but never got the case my phone is very cool and i like it alot im mr mullan,3
my note  came a little sooner than expected and i have loved it it was exactly as described and i recommend it to everyone i never want to lose it or brake it i bought the otter box defender case for it also highly recommended,5
many features did not work on straight talk and pictures are always upside down okay for the price phone was in good condition and is as represented by seller i did my homework too about the types of phone operating systems that would work on straight talk,4
i love this phone it is the best phone that i have so far i love using air command and the spen great great phone it came unlocked just like it said and i did not have any problems setting it up with tmobile i am glad i got it,5
this phone arrived in excellent condition and has been a great phone all around i love the big screen and am surprised at how well it fits into my ladies size pockets dont think i could ever go back to a smaller screen,5
came with a few minor scratches but the phone overall did what it was meant to i didnt have a single scratch on the screen but had some chipped paint on the sides the price was pretty amazing for the product though,5
received my new galaxy note  i love it a lot was not sure how to turn my data on had to go to the networks from my settings i also only received the phone and the instructions thankfully i have a charger that will fit my phone  stars from me,4
good phone love it no problem if you have t mobile u better off going through them buying so u get head set and good charger the charger they send doesnt make the batt last long u need a samsung charger,5
im a big fan of the features however if i put the phone in my pocket upside down it will randomly restart from what i have read this could be an sd card or sim card issue but id rather sacrifice my convenience to hold onto the phone and stay connected,4
i would of given it  stars because its a greattt phone but when i opened the box it had no headset and the picture specifically shows that it was coming with one but other than that the phone is great no problems whatsoever ill be purchasing  more,4
amazingi bought this to put on walmart family mobile just put my sim card in and i was in business the s pen is so cool the pink phone is exactly the same color as the picture battery seems to hold very good ringtone volume is loud i love this phone,5
i feel like used the device had been used and am trying to register it and am having problems never before has my heart felt as heavy and dirty as it does right now am looking to returning it the phone works just fine but i feel very disgusted,2
awfulnot describe in shoul have been properly describe adebrethdfvfyk hgkhkuiiuyhjkythgfjyuyjhgjghtuuiyii rteytrytruy tytryty trytjhjt khjkoo kjhjiijhjhgko kuyiu uyikuykuy uyik uyiuyiuyi uyui,1
great phone super fast great color son loves this phone great price for a non contract phone compared to what they charge at the phone stores was advised to get new sd card for every new phone for if to run at its best so runs perfect,5
nice phone with tons of user friendly features powerful wireless communications and crystal clear voice its large screen makes it fun to watch video work and read emails or go through your calendar i recommend it even though it is a little pricy,5
all expectations were met with this phone i love the notes but must have had the international version i bought from walmart it was aweful bought this from amazon as always amazon rocks thanks amazon as always,5
phone was actually pretty good but i developed a problem with the antenna while under warranty samsung support is terrible if support is important to you avoid samsung as their reps simply do not take ownership of problems,2
unfortunately the phone is not unlocked it was a gift for my mom and she hasnt been able to connect it due to her having to pay  to unlock it im waiting for her to send it back to me as i am in another state im planning on returning it,2
false advertisement advertised as a verizon phone and after receiving it i spent  minutes on the phone with a verizon csr only to learn that this is not a verizon phone my activate sim card wasnt being recognized immediately same day initiated a refundreturn,1
i think this one has had its screen replaced by someone who did it with tape or something pretty shortly into the life of the phone the screen would come loose had to keep it in an otterbox defender to keep it together without breaking it,4
i was so hoping this would work tho i was sceptical still not sure if my phone was new or reconditionedworked great for about ten days but then started misbehaving correction after correction since then right up to now returning very disappointed,1
broke  days after buying it sound has issues i cant talk on regular phone i have to always use speaker all sound apps including youtube you cant hear volume is all the way up what phone i ever owned do not buy,1
i love the droid turboit deserves  stars the one i received seemed good at the start but i had trouble with my bluetooth device once set up and connected it was fine then turn it off and when it connected it wouldnt connect for the phone usage only for media,3
this is the second time i have had issues with this phone the first had an issue with the speaker which i chalked up to software this one the power button fell out and cant be turned on now not great support from the sellers or manufacturers,1
this phone works nicely quick response take really nice pictures power last for the day running many things i really like so far i feel it has been a nice purchase nicely priced shipped right on schedule thanks,5
not long after i got the phone it started shutting off and take over  minutes to reboot kept saying android optimizing apps looked at motorola forums and this is a big problem with motorola phones will never buy another motorola phone,1
amazing phone i especially like the moto app that came preinstalled i can text without even taking the phone out of my pocket it did not take long for me to figure out how to use it with just a little bit of googling,5
the phone itself was fine ive had one before the problem was the charger cord that came with it i bought  of the phones and both charger cords take hours to recharge phones i have been using an old charger i had and it works  times faster,3
worked fair for first  days voice volume for calls was extremely low then it decides just power on and off consistently thinking it is not worth the hassle to buy phone via amazon too many issues luckily within  day return window but what a nuisance,2
if this phone has limits i dont know what they are battery life is superb never less than  hours sometimes almost two days have not had to use the charger in the car since purchase most other features very good to excellent,5
great phone battery life is solid and the phone is very durable i dont use a case have dropped it on concrete several times no cracks or any issues other than a few scratches on the edge motorola makes great phones and this is no exception,5
nice long lasting battery nice material and quick interface based on the google launcher but more stock i play with it while at work for hours to let the time go by and it lasts it goes the distance and keeps on going,5
phone works great i have dropped it multiple times with no damage whatsoever to phone this thing is tough i am absolutely thrilled with the purchase of this phone battery life is so much longer than any other phone ive ever had phone is very user friendly,5
i bought  of these from this company the glass is supposed to be scratchresistant corning gorilla glass  but the glass on one of the phones was scratched and cracked and the charging port on the other one doesnt work right,1
phone in decent condition however the camera worked enough to take  pictures then had errors initializing camera i researched this error and the first link found was a virus attachment i returned the phone and question the third party retailer,1
great case that provides a reasonable amount of protection for dropping the phone on the corners there are cases that are more rugged but they are also bulkier and this phone is big enough without adding more to it,4
i loved this droid trubo for the first few months i have had it great battery life amazing display powerful processor but after a few months of owning it the phone constantly restarted and now it wont even turn on,1
ive been pretty disappointed so far the battery gets very hot while running simple apps and also just while charging and the battery life is nowhere near what is advertised maybe i just received a defective but i will be going to verizon soon,3
best specs big battery in a small body front facing speaker good grip and all with a usable and reasonable screen size make this phone not only the best android on verizon but the best android phone period,5
best phone i ever owned  droid has come a very long way over the past few years ive had the turbo for  weeks and every feature is very impressive except the camers im hoping with a future update that will fix the minor issues with the camera,5
love this phone huge storage capacity battery is fantastic compared to my previous phone and it charges very fast with the provided charger only downfall is that it does get pretty hot when charging would definitely recommend it,5
from c j c on august   not new as stated when i ordered it when i ordered this product it said new this is not new its used it had an old used screen protector on it and old box it did not have the fast charger thats supposed to go with it,1
great phone works great no problems with phone or seller wastes alot less battery and data than any samsung ive owned  samsungs and they all just wasted away power and data i used to use  gigs and now use gbmonth and nothing in my life has changed,5
absolutely love my droid turbo bought this after i dropped mine and shattered the screen love the fast charging and the nice big screan great price will keep buying these when mine break until there are no more,5
loved this phone the only thing is my lte signal i used it with tmobile signal is erratic but besides that the phone is of great quality and gorgeous screen not to mention battery will last a day or two,4
i cracked the screen on my droid turbo looked at some repair places at they cost just as much if not more than buying this phone phone is in great condition i charged the phone moved sim from old phone to this and works perfectly couldnt be happier,5
great phone it works really well ive had it for about a year now and its still going strong anything that is battery draining seems to drain the battery a little faster the past month or so but not anything unreasonable,5
phone was exactly as described no problems getting service with verizon as my replacement phone delivery was prompt and required a signature thank you i was nervous buying a phone on amazon but this was a great buying experience,5
would have given it five stars but the charger is faulty and gets too hot to handle not worth the time to return it so i use my charger from the old phone the charger even gets too hot to handle even if no cable is in or if its charging or not,4
my wife loves this phone great battery life important since shes a nurse and is on the phone quite a bit during the course of the day solid device through and through does not heat up even with extended use,5
great phone does the job not too complicated but lots of bells and whistles two things that are not great ringer volume is not real loud and sound controls require many steps unless you just use sound button on the side to raise lower,5
i love my droid turbo it is doing everything i want it to do i use google docs for work so keep track of load information so far i have had my phone for a little over a month the is not quite as fast as the iphone still takes great pictures,5
great phone im a month into using it and am really loving how it runs on lollypop the camera and light gestures the battery life  i usually have  battery left by the end of a moderate use day the voice control,5
best phone i ever had you leave the mobile hotspot going and it stays almost all day before the battery dies unlock my motorola droid razr maxx which didnt last two hours love the phone and all of its features even love the way it looks,5
i am in love with this phone but after having it a couple of weeks the glass shatteredwhile sitting in the seat of my car apparently this is a common problem and a hard expensive repair i dont know if a case will help but my next one will have one,3
i purchased this phone straight from verizon as upgrade to my dna this phone is amazing pleaee dont hesitate to get it it came with kit kat os but now the new software is available i havent upgraded yet only because i love my phone so much  d,5
this phone is absolutely amazing the battery life is incredible and charges very quickly although the camera is a little grainy in low light the screen could get brighter also seems a little dim other than that i cant find a thing wrong with this phone,4
the battery life is not what i expected the phone gets hot when used and charging the camera is great but the camera app is not the best or very user friendly the phone tends to be slow and the touch screen is unresponsive at times,3
great phone easy to navigate and make calls big screen great battery life great camera fast internet dropped it a bunch of times already and the screen didnt crack the phone is like an f and the iphone is like a honda prius in comparison,5
phone isnt green its black and windows phones are terrible half of the apps available on ios and android arent available on windows but it made calls and texts and emails so it did what i needed until i could upgrade,2
im sorry but this phone was awful it would freeze up quite a bit the camera is not very good to be honest this would be a good starter phone for a older kid i ended up going to verizon and getting an iphone and keeping this phone for my son once he is of age,3
the phone came with ear buds and charger looks good but within the first week of having it the battery over heated and wouldnt charge luckily i had the battery to my old phone and am using that now and it works fine,3
bought this last year and the fone only work for two months put it on d charger and came back noting came on to the screen carry it to a electronic shop they told me that the fone is and refurbished phone an had serious problems,1
this is a high quality phone for good priced i put it on straight talk and it works amazing make sure when you first get it to manually set time and date or your account wont set right but the apps are so much better than apple or android you will love this phone,5
the phone was nice too unfortunately i couldnt get my automotive app to work on the windows operating system but i would buy from icellsolution again the price was good they were fast and the phone was just as advertised,5
just the phone i was looking for to upgrade nearly perfect condition i had to do a factory reset to receive mms texts but absolutely no complaints about the phone seems even easier to use than my previous lumia  love it,5
i love this phone to many times i have bought a phone only to find they forgot to make the phone part the primary function not to take anything away from the computer part i can truly say that there is nothing i can say negative about this one,5
had to send the phone to samsung manufacturing company to get the phones software fixed but the device was in warranty and was fixed at only the shipping costs be sure to ask the seller if the software functions properly before purchasing a faulty product like i did,2
used phone that was advertised as in very good condition the battery drains the camera does not work it continues to update nonstop bought this for my son for getting straight as in school so disappointing wrote to seller and waiting for response,1
shipping was very fast product was well packaged and no damage product was described perfectly i simply love this phone the features and settings are customized for individually which is very nice overall a very high quality item,5
battery life is absolutely terrible my wife cant get a full days usage out of this phone i got an s because of the bigger battery but even that one isnt great and i need to charge it at least once a day if i use it at all,2
current apple user almost purchased a used iphone  for a similar price this phone in comparison has a larger brighter screen better camera ir remote control blaster wireless charging expandable memory and i got a gb model for the price of a gb iphone,5
this phone lasted me about  months before the battery burned out along with some really expensive parts as in what i paid for the phone itself  the phone was perfect for me but i wouldnt buy refurbished again ,2
it over heats when being charged gets so hot i have to put it up so my child doesnt touch it it will not stay charged it freezes all the time it cuts itself on and off cuts me off in the middle of phone calls its by far the worst phone i have ever had,1
phone sucked didnt work both times we got it first one we got the person calling you couldnt hear the person on the other end and sent it back for replacement and then the second one we got did the same thingsent it back and they refunded our money,1
i returned it and got the note  instead this is a good phone but the one i had couldnt get updated to the lastest version of android that att released theres also a lot of junk att apps that i dont need and cant delete,5
im very happy with my samsung galax s edge battery sucks but thats samsungs fault the gizmotrader was a awesome company that got my phone to me in  daysand katie refunded me  to get a batterycase so this company rocks,5
overall this phone is terrible because the loopbattery life stinks battery dies witun one hour horrible phone for a professional that needs a phone i always have a charger attached to me might as well be a land line,4
phone is in superb condition without any malfunctions cracks or scratches everything works as of the device was brand new my only recommendation would be to supply better chargers luckily i still had my fast charger from my previous galaxy s,5
i bought this for my mom and she loves it she saw that i got the note edge and she loved it so i got her this one the note edge would have been too big for her little hands i almost bought this phone for myself but i love a bigger phone,5
i did like it until after  months the phone died samsung wont honor warranty since it was bought from a third party seller i am done with samsung phones previous ones i have purcashed have had negative issues as well,2
it might be a great phone but att told me that the att nano sim it ships with this is invalid and requires replacement or is that just a way for them to make money on another note the phone was unlocked when received,5
needed a phone quickly after my galaxy s quit on me was able to get this one quick for great price the phone arrived in great shape  looks brand new ive had it for a few weeks now with no issues so far,5
i was sold this phone and it had an account attached to the ime number that the previous bill was never paid so now im stuck not able to unlock it because it has money owed from a previous owner yet i paid a good price to buy it for a go plan with att,1
i have had issues with this refurbished phone since i received it the battery will not stay charged the reception is substandard and it freezes regularly my s that i replaced this with acted better and it was years old i am not happy with this purchase,2
i really like this phone the battery life could be better but it is responsive does well and isnt too big since i refuse to pay the big money for the latest greatest this phone hits a price point that i like and provides both value and quality,5
great screen image but not much the s one major problem is the wifi have the fastest home internet but the phone takes for ever to load all other devices work except my phone seems to operate at dial up speed on wifi works great on network internet,3
phone works great and it is just like new no scratches or anything on the phone flawless exactly just what the description said very happy with this phone will order again from this company if i need another phone,5
 weeks after purchase  weeks after the return window closed the phone stopped working it just went blank would turn neither off nor on and would charge tried to save money but it wasnt worth it in the end,1
phone had a thick bubble wrap around it to make it safe when the package delivers i was suprised no scratches nothing wrong with the phone its fast and works like a charm  if your trying to get a samsung s edge this is the place you should be looking at  ,5
as expected this phone is awesome have had all the galaxy phones many numerous times due to my phone obsession issues the gs edge so far is my favorite and as promised by amazon i did indeed receive the device on the release with free overnight shipping,5
i ordered a samsung galaxy s edge in very good condition and aside from one tiny scuffnick on the bottom bezel the phone is in great cosmetic condition and works perfectly just as expected the price was reasonable too thanks i love it,5
there is some sort of a glue on the top right part of the display and it doesnt seem to go away ive cleaned it with water and a soft cloth as well any way of getting rid of this patches on the screen ,2
fast phone thin and lightweight the edge screen isnt practical the functionality it does have is useless and often holding the phone results in the screen sensing more than one finger on it because of the dual edges dont waste your money just get a s or note ,3
its a great phone but when i unlocked it and inserted my tmobile sim card i didnt get lte even g was very week and not stable apparently att blocked some frequencies that tmobile is using just a word of caution for others who wants to unlock it,4
wow bought  of these notice  of them is now coming apart in the back out of alot of money should not have happened any chance of a replacement got our replacement but missing sim card and card holder still cant use this phone grrr,1
this stunning design let your content shine it has superb clarity and loud digital speakers and not to mention hd qualityif you are looking for a top quality phone i would definitely recommend the samsung galaxy s edge,4
bought it used still in amazing condition one tiny little scratch by the rear camera lens phone works like a dream i got one for me and one for my husband verizon offered an upgrade we stayed with our s edge,5
its a great phone but the battery just doesnt last as long as it should sometimes it will last for almost a day and sometimes not even an entire day i like it but i would also like the batter to last longer,3
battery power is its major issue the low power mode is basically a gimmick it makes it into a barely functional phone wish the battery lasted longer also has some quirks sometimes it calls people unexpectedly even when i just turned it off,4
good product but screen to small for this ol geezer and sent back i settled on the samsung s edge  gb much better but hard to find for tracfone user has to be used  att has the phone or verizon used can be used and accepted by trachone,3
i came from a htc one m htc was great but not with my cars bluetooth people on the other end always said i was breaking up when they heard me this s does everything and does it super fast great camera this phone is awesome,5
terrific hardware regrettably marred ny lollipop  touch wiz problems memory leak makes phone painfully slow and notification screen wont pull down unless phone is rebooted every few hours returned phone and will purchase the lg g soon as it debuts,3
great phone with a stunning new design completely changed the game with aluminum frame and glass frontback the edge looks stunning the camera is amazing front and back the  bit processor is super snappy and screen is the best on the market,5
ny wife got me an edge  for my birthday on april th works well and has a solid feel to it i will trade up to the gb model next year i take a lot of pictures and even the gb gives me great storage for musicpicturesvideos,5
the phone overheated operated poorly and died after  months of barely any use do not purchase a phone from this retailer unless you enjoy burning your hand and being out of a phone until you can afford a newer one,1
i know this type of phone is great however this one i purchase sim card slot did not work therefore i was stock with a shell of a phone this was an horrible experience i dont usually get plenty of bad purchase but this one took the cake,1
after  week of use the phone stuck when turning it on tmobile screen appears and remains stuck i dont know wtf happen such a ripped offff do not be fooled by other reviews it is a waste of money do not buy if you dont want to suffer the same,1
im partly to blame i should have read up on the phone it was no longer offered by service providers do to issues i paid for shipping both ways for a phone the smaller knows is below any standard i believe i have been chetted,1
the camera is broken it will eternally try and zoom but never will the pictures always turn out blurry im dissatisfied other than that the phone is pretty alright there are scratches but nothing as bad as the faulty camera that was not restored,3
my phone just stopped working after barely mthsthree days ago am so upsetcause its cost me a lot of money this is the first time i have bought something from amazon and give a bad review for its product not happy with this,1
the device is great but it was supposed to be unlocked and while it works with other cellphone companies it came with all sorts of annoying att apps and now i cant update it to a newer android version because its not in the att server,2
the phone i received is broken the back and menu button flash when plugged into charge the screen is very sluggish and slow i made sure to make sure everything was updated rebooted factory reset nothing worked,1
did not work with my sim card it was not compatible in any way says it was unlocked but it was not my wife took it to korea and it would not work with her sim card there either nice phone and great packaging but could not use it,1
the phone came as described the battery just drains too fast and the phone itself gets too hot but apart from that excellent phone i truly didnt expected it to be new but it really has cero scratch on it so i got more than i expected,5
extremely happy sometimes have to remind myself that it was used before no problems at all everything was reset perfectly although it was packaged poorly it came with a charger but with no transformer but i bought one an eaglewood charger that was perfect,5
the product and the reviews seem to be very misleading about this product when i got my ipod touch g i was very disappointed to find out that it does not have a back camera despite reviews saying it does i hope that i can find a way to return it,2
the ipod is in nice shape however the ad is not accurate it does not include the charger which is an original accessory also it doesnt come in a box so if this is a gift theyll know it is used very disappointed,3
so glad there are still nice quality flip phones out there for those of us that spend most of our time in rural areas with limited data access and just want a phone that wont make me cry when i drop it in the rocks and dirt,5
this flip phone is perfect for basic usage the numbers are large and has the capability to change the color to see the front clock clear without glasses nice phone and durable has been dropped several times and no damage,5
my parents did not want a smart phone and this was a perfect replacement for the previous flip phone volume seems to be much better and it has a bit more heft to it to ensure less likely hood of dropping,5
no frills basic phone for my son to start out with appears to be very rugged which im sure my son will test delivery was quick and product was as described so far very easy to use easily input contacts and such,4
i bought the phone as a back up when my other phone finally broke i took this one into a verizon store to have the service switched they told me it was too old  that it wouldnt work i threw the phone away  lost  ,1
i bought this as a replacement it is a sturdy reliable phone without all the fancy extras unfortunately after less than  days it quit working i had to buy a replacement phone immediately because i could not be without a phone,4
had st generation convoy for six years till i went swimming with it now i have this one and love it best feature for me is the charge last well over a week the keys on this one are also bigger which i like,5
it doesnt make sense to write a review about the old outdated flip phone itself but i will say the phone was in like new condition and works exactly as described it arrived quickly and the price was fair,5
i bought this phone to send to my sister in venezuela the phone did not work there and by the time i received it back to be returned the returning window had expired and i am now stock with a product that i dont need here impossible to communicate with amazon,1
this phone wont download or load mp music files will take photos on blue tooth but not music what gives here works fine as far as text and talk the data is a joke takes forever so dont get this phone of you want to do a lot of interner,1
verizon said the phone was from  however the phone was listed as new there was no instruction manual and the phone could not be activated i spent eleven dollars mailing it back this was a scam you suck,1
my crazy husband loves this flip phone in fact it is a replacement for one exactly like it that he has had for some time which developed a crack most likely from dropping it it has an excellent charge capacity certainly better than my smart phone,5
the phone microphone was terrible i tried restarting updating the firmware cleaning itetc nothing worked the seller wouldnt stand behind the product and offered a partial refund after only  days,1
i love this phone i upgraded my audiovox yes audiovox cdm with this like the built in light the button and screen size bluetooth is hooked up with my car for hands free calls should be a durable phone,5
if you plan to use with verizon assure to check with them before you buy this mobile wont work with total wireless tw would need mei numbers  amazon wont know the number until you buy tw only accept their own flip mobile,3
this is my husbands nd phone like this he is so hard on his phones hes always working outside and drops them frequently this phone is tough and made to military standards also it is just a plain flip phone so he can actually work it lol,5
the phone functions however people have a hard time hearing me no problem with signal i am with verizon sometimes the phone doesnt even ring and you see missed calls the push to talk does not work with verizon on this model purchased two wish i didnt,2
i ordered this item for a friend however i did go thru the men and settings icon this fone has many bells and whistles on menu very durable made and it had verizon hookup and the owner had to go to verizon to activate fone,5
worked really well with cricket wireless sim not truly unlocked as all the att nrtwork apps and bloatware were still on it and could not be removed unless you root the phone which we did not want to do easy switching with samsung smart switch app,3
i think i got what i paid for the phone doesnt move as fast as i would like maybe it needs to be debugged or whatever its fine for what im using it for which is work thats what i get for buying an older phone next time ill buy them the uptodate from,3
didnt use it much for anything but samsung pay and wifi access but it has a beautiful display a great camera and a responsive and snappy os even with all the extras samsung likes to bloat their phones with,5
i got this for my husband he really did like it but since day one the phone overheat really bad he couldnt hold it second one it would die sooooooooo fast it would charge and after few hours would just die,1
at first the phone was really good working perfect condition no scratches etc but after  months the phone was locked by att due to unpaid balance this is a scam since i bought this phone as advertised unlocked ,1
not stoked about all the att branding but it was evident from the listing so this phone meets all expectations at a much lower price than from my carrier and then it would just have their branding instead,5
great phone previous owner is broke and had to finesse the system to make some  i have the documents to prove it too ill be sure to send these documents to have a set forth solution to prevent this cruelty for other loyal amazon customers,1
the cellphone is perfect it doesnt have any issue except that for an hour o more it have a problem that the botton of back and menu begin push them selves and you cant just use the telephone until it pass out it looks like it was refurbished,1
they sell this phone as new but it is not true i ordered the phone and worked well for first two month after that its battery couldnt keep the charge more than  hours it wasnt a mobile phone anymore i had to connect it to the power all the time,1
several phone calls to carrier could not resolve texting issues determined it was a phone software problem attempting to communicate with samsung or google was beyond my patience level returned phone for refund,1
right after a month my the phone stop working it didnt want to turn on and the screen started glitching well i never tend to write any bad reviews but i just wanted you to save your money and let you know to buy another type of phone,1
dont buy this one you have to charge it at least twice a day even if you dont use it at all some of my know persons also returned this one for this issue though its look so good slim and camera is nice,1
this sucks the phone looked fine but its is not comparable with verizon purchased this for my dad and now im out  and my dad still doesnt have a cell phone dont buy this dont get scammed out the  like i did,1
i bought the phone and its asking me for a sim network unlock pin id love for the store to contact me about this issue update  i called the company and they were very nice in assisting me get the sim network unlock pin issue resolved,4
bought phone from mobile deals through amazon it was new as stated and came in sealed factory samsung packaging i have att already and this phone was the att model so everything is working great thanks to mobile deals and amazon for a great product,5
today i got delivery of phone but here shows it is unlocked and when i checked the phone it shows it is a t mobile phone i am so pissed off what if i go to another country will another sim card than t mobile work,2
its an tt product the screen keeps freezing and also the s keeps restarting everytime dont recommend it to buy it here i have already return the item today on march  and i i hope to get all my money back and also the  dollars i spent to make the delivery,1
this phone gets hot to the point where you cant hold the phone in your hand it also drops your calls the phone does not function as it should and i am afraid this phone will burst into flames without warning,1
worst phone i ever used get extremely slow after used for a while im not just talking about the normal android slow im talking about  second response time screen freeze slow factory does not change it such pos will never get another samsung,1
delivered in great condition i wanted to stay with the s size since i like to carry it in my pocket and my battery was no longer holding a charge seamless transition of apps and settings using samsung cloud im very happy with this purchase,5
well the phones work ive gotten two about  days then crap out one cant call the other cant even turn on and the youre sol because the warranty runs out after  day and the vendor plays that card hard dont buy anything from them,1
 signal drops for half day  person on the other end of the call cant hear me i have to restart and then wait for  mins to make a call again  gets really hot one can fry an egg on it ive had other samsung product but this one is my worst buy,1
ive just plugged the charger in the outlet and it had a short circuit the charger not the phone so i think that it is not completely reliable as it should be the phone seems ok but it came with some att apps maybe it is refurbished,2
the only thing this thing has wrong with it is the battery is being drained fast which should be assumed with a phone this old i will be buying a new battery and putting it in myself still saved alot of money and it works like a charm,5
got it on timethe seller is not at fault here worked great for the first four months then the charging connector port started malfunctioning and now im looking to replace it again the seller is not at fault this is a manufacturing flaw,1
amazing phone comfortable to hold dynamic themes and very fast ive used this phone for almost two years with no issues at all it hasnt slowed down at all which is a problem ive had with other phones one of the best phones ive ever used highly recommended,5
got this for hubby who had one as a work phone but had to turn it in when they stopped offering work phones it works just like the one he had before except he has a pay as you go instead of a contract  he is very happy with it,5
worst piece of junk ever ive had it for less than  years and it jumps screens wont answer when you swipe it sound goes up and down if youre looking for a new smart phone get an apple samsung sucks,1
i wont spend  more penny in any samsung products they are worthless product and super expensive dont waste your money in any samsungs products watches phones  do yourself a favorite and spend your money in another product,1
phone is nice i bought two both had some scratches though battery life is terrible on both i can leave it alone and it will die within  hours easy and i have no bars almost anywhere not even in my house im constantly fighting for signal,1
this phone was great till now it wont turn on and it is a paper weight cant believe it only lasted  months and i never dropped it other than off my bed onto carpet im so mad rn no refund in sight for my phone,1
i purchased this phone in august as an unlocked phone and now it is asking me for an sim card unlock code i contacted att and somehow there is a account payment due this shouldnt be happening as i purchased this phone unlocked,1
i had shattered my old phones screen and decided to go for this one my experiemce was excellent the phone arrived quickly and in excellent condition works great the seller was very attentive and responsive i had a great experience would definitely recommend,5
had this thing for less than  months had to do a factory reset withing the first  weeks seven weeks after purchase this thing is dead it will not turn on it plays the startup tune over and over again but none of the button presses to reset the phone work,1
i got a phone from att instead of the unlocked version also it seems not to be new it has a scratch on the back and battery life is really terrible i had an s before and battery was not great but decent in this phone i get about  hour of screen on time,1
i have no comment about the phone because everything works great smooth but the mail problem is the battery battery drops from  to  in less than  hours even on wifi on glte its a disaster battery must change,4
i purchased this phone in june it is now october and the speaker for the phone sounds like its underwater completely blown out ive never had a phone do that there has been no damage to the phone really annoyed as i got this for work,1
great phone just remember this is a bare bones phone that doesnt come with a file manager or music player but its easy to download them on the app store amazing price for an gb non contract phone for us cellular highly recommend it,5
had the same issue as previous customers being told by us cellular that this phone can not be activated on a contract plan that is bull after second call they finally did activate it love the moto transfer from motorola to motorola,5
i bought this with the intent of changing devices on my current plan was not able to do i tried calling to activate and i also went a us cellular store and was told the same thing not sure how others got this working on an existing plan,1
the phone works fine it is zippy fast and reliable for the price although youre not getting a flagship experience this phone running the latest lollipop software besides marshmallow this makes as a great mp and phone highly recommend for the price,5
this is my first smart phone so there was and is a learning curve but i have to say this a great phone for the money it does everything except tie your shoes for you i am saving a lot of money by not leasing an iphone or galaxy,5
listing and package say it has  gb internal memory but it only has  gb i know how memory works and that it is usually a little less than listed but the difference of  gb vs  gb is not how it should be,4
ok so i got it and its a nice phone a little beat up but looks great solid battery life but for the life of my i cant get a steady wifi connection on this thing love the suite of apps but ill be returning it for a s or s active,3
could not make it passed initialization process out of the box before it started to slow down stop the process and need to restart phone completely unusable extremely aggravating using att mobile transfer or trying to,1
i was sick and tired of my iphones the worthless updates that never worked right and how it would stop working with peripherals is why i made the switch this phone has just as many features and was a fraction of the price,5
used for  weeks after two weeks camera started making noise after  weeks screen went completely black phone is working based indicator light and notification vibration but screen is completely black and not working this cant be a new phone as advertised,1
i love this phone better battery life than my s and i love the physical buttons faster than may last few android phones as well the blue camo is also a nice touch i was worried it would be too much but it is subtle enough to not be a major issue,5
phone arrived quickly and works perfectly there was a minor scuff on the back but i dont care and saved a ton of money compared to new at the att store totally happy with it s active is awesome esp compared to my  yrs old motorola android,5
came as expected however there is a battery issue nothing major but will worsen with time it shuts off anywhere between  then when placed on charged immediately reads  otherwise works great and i was pleased with the condition,4
ive had this phone for exactly three months the software never updates properly and now the screen just went black the phone still receives calls and messages but the screen remains inactive tried every trick in the book,2
it cracked the day i got it dropped it on the carpet from the couch to the carpet and the screen went black the camera lens had a couple scratches other than that its been a decent phone had to spend  on a new screen though which was not fun,4
super fast shipping received several days early i absolutely love my samsung s active great condition and price all of my questions were answered prior to purchase and i am thrilled with my purchase i highly recommend thanks again,5
not new refurbished it should say that in the description but all for not just some generic samsung advertisement for it to be unlocked  they had to open it well its an att exclusive phone its not supposed to be unlocked,1
some scratches on the frontno big deal the thing that bothers me is that sometimes the sound is garbled mostly happens on the ring tone and other alerts but also once in awhile when im talking on the phone,3
when the phone come in the screen was broken at the bottom corner beside the back button i didnt send an email to tell bc at the time i was locked out of my account and now i have access to it again what do i need to do to get it fixed,1
the phone was a gift for my teenage son it works perfectly it came in before we expected it to he loves it thanks for a great product for a great price without getting into another contract i will use you guys when its time for another phone,5
decent phone although the home button started to break in less than a year decent cases are hard to find for this since its an att exclusive also att is very slow to push updates to this so dont expect to have the latest os in a timely manner,3
over heats been through  of them they never fix the problem plus the replaced with refurbished wont replace any more and still paying off samsung and att have been absolutely useless one positive thing is it is sturdy,1
love this phone i have dropped and tossed it its like any phone u still have to be careful with it my boyfriend has that indestructible phonenot samsung the screen did not break but the phone did,5
i have gone through  of these with no hard use or abuse they are carp i had a note  it was way more reliable then these pieces the active always had glass screen protector and case every single one ended up with a dead screen with the audio still working,1
this phone is a joke dropped on the tile floor at starbucks and the screen shattered only had the phone  weeks i guess i was too active att didnt care went into the store with the phone sorry tough luck was their response you shouldnt have dropped it,1
on the phone with samsung last  minutes phone slipped off couch and shattered screen fell less than  feet samsung response  refused to let me talk to supervisor and will not stand by their product phone less than  months old,1
didnt realize when my son bought this that the samsung warranty was already expired he stated having issues about  months after getting it and amazon nor sumsung would replace it ended up going to att to buy him a new one lesson learned,2
i love my s active ive had it for several months now and just got around to reviewing it it is everything that it was described as  very durable and functional for an active busy  rough user i would absolutely recommend this phone,5
i love my phone i used to have a samsung s and i need a change so i decide to purchase this one it get a little bit hot but like my old phone nothing extrem its very fast i like it a lot no complains,5
the phone is good but the battery heats up when taking a video using the camera gps or playing a video for just under  min to think with all the high specs of the phone they should have made it to at leastnot heat up annoying,4
bought this not even  months ago it keeps restarting in the middle of nowhere no water damage no cracks or breaks i tried clearing the cache like it said online and it still restarts something is probably up with the hardware so buyer beware,2
i just started getting messages that i wasnt connected to the network i went to the tmobile store to find out that the phone is locked and using unauthorized software because of that i was not able to receive any of the samsung updates and now have a worthless phone,1
this phone has been useless from the beginning  it over heats  the battery will not hold a charge i wish i had of just returned the phone instead of thinking these things would maybe get better stupid on my part now stuck with a piece of junk ,2
phone is not eligible to be unlocked according to tmobile already bought all the accessories for the phone guess ill have to return those as well paid money for a phone i cant even use other than that the phone was in good shape,1
the phone is like new but malfunctioning it should be  stars but not good for anything the return button is damaged and i was not able to advance to choose the language because it was returned to the previous step,1
never us your finer print to lock your phone is a bad idea if someone trys to unlock your phone it will lock you out too i try to reset the phone it reset but know it doesnt reconized my number or my gmail  dollars down the drain it sux,1
i bought this phone for my moms friend after ive not seen her in while she told me that the phone i bought was stolen she had to send the phone to her home country because she did not that i couldn return it,1
this phone is very good i got this phone for my birthday a while ago and it has held up perfectly this phone is really fast and can handle anything you throw at it i would highly reccomend this to anyone looking for a great phone that wont break the bank,5
its a great phone glad i brought it very user friendly for those who are familiar with the galaxy brand the only and i do me only problem is no expandable memory though that was my fault for not investigating further that aside it is a awesome phone,4
very nice phone got a refurbished one works just as well as a new one with the exception on the battery life the battery is draining fairly quickly but besides having to put it on the charger often it steal of a deal buying it used,4
the phones charge port is damaged so you have to buy a charge pad even when fully charged it drains super fast and wont hold a charge very disappointed i will be asking for a refund or at the very least a new battery,1
dont buy from the place name that starts with bay i bought a galaxy s that had a defective sim card reader but everything else was fine but you cant use the phone youd have no service so what is the point,1
after four months the phone will not hold a charge turns off randomly super glitchy and battery last like two hours customer support just says sorry nothing we can do for the money you waste on this you think it would last more than four months,1
advertised as refurbished its not advertised to work with sprint does not work with prepaid plans i switched to ting phone arrived almost a week late but i was reimbursed for shipping otherwise i am happy with the phone great camera quality ample storage,3
i have always hesitated getting a used phone especially siteunseen but i got this the other day and its perfect i brought it to sprint and they checked to make sure it wasnt blacklisted and it wasnt so far it works great thank you,5
phone is in new condition i love it but i think i was tricked the screen is plastic and it is kinda difficult to type and sometimes the screen didnt respond due to the plastic screen i dont think its gorilla glass ,3
great phonegood batteryspeakerno dropped calls nor wifi problems awesome screen plus the edge screen and apps make this a phone fun to customize still wish it had an sd card but with gb im very satisfied,4
so glad i ordered this phone seller has great qualityturned off the normal bloatware and extras so battery last all day and into the night without charging love the large screen and phone fits my hands and easy to hold and carry,5
i loved this phone when it first came out and was happy to see i could still get this older model still was beautiful and looked brand new when i got it havent had any problems with it at all i will buy from this vendor again,5
it arrived quickly and was well packaged i followed the directions got some help from verizon and it was ready to go it has worked wonderfully so far it is a far better phone than what i had before i have been very happy with this purchase,5
absolutely love the phone but the charger that was sent to me was not the charger that actually came with the phone originally i got a charger that works but isnt the cord that goes with this phone and does the fast charge,5
had bruised place under screen when i got it out of box to charge it before i ever activated then noticed small lines through screen making words and letters not clear small chip on corner bottom opposite of the bruise like spot in top right area,2
warning buying this phone through arad system is viewed as an unauthorized reseller by samsung and voids the warranty the processor fails on this phone in less than a year so youll be throwing youre money away if you buy this phone,1
as usual for a refurb nfc doesnt work i returned my last refurb because of this because im sick of having to carry a wallet again everything else works fine looks like ill just have to buy a new phone if i want everything to work though,2
love love love it  bought it in dec and its still great slow at times but it even tells you you have to turn it off then on so the updates can work better you know restart your phone i had to do it once and its fast,5
i loved the phone wasnt too hard to connect but i had boost mobile and i couldnt connect the phone with them had to go to sprintthe battery life is like a  but phone looked barely used and i love it ,4
great purchase definitely buy its brand new came with charger headphones and most importantly it works with no flaws great battery life great screen resolution very satisfied and its unlock im using this with cricket,5
im in love with this phone and it works great was really crushed about note  but this note  works great and have not had a day of trouble with it other than being on the crappy sprint network  great phone pos network stay away from sprint,5
lets v start with the biggest con you cant be on the internet and on the phone at the same time unless you are on wifi which was bs it worked great  did the job just a year later the phone started having malfunctions thankfully i was able to buy a new phone,4
great phone strong battery the vr applications work flawlessly phone is perfect size no slippery sides like my old lg samsung is the best oh yeah the stylus is excellent very reactive and precise touch like a pen and paper,5
i bought this after my original got stolen and i hadnt gotten insurance  a very small scratch was on the home button but everything else was immaculate and it worked smoothly with my verizon account i have had the phone for months with no issue thank you,5
malfunctioned phone  when it arrived it kept telling me to install a software i installed it  times an it kept showing up an popping upthe seller has poor communications  never responds dont buy from this person you will regret it ,5
bought the phone for my daughter  month ago i was worried about buying it online however after a month i can report no problems so far battery holds a great charge phone was new and in original packaging i have been pretty happy so far,5
i have had this phone purchase on amazon for less than  days and i am having issues with the phone turning itself off i am hoping that amazon will help with dealing with the  day warranty but havent heard anything so far,1
i was skeptical reading the reviews because my phone was being ordered for work i am very happy with the phone it looks like it is brand new the battery life is fine and it does what i need for my job great price,5
this is the best device i have ever owned and im going back to  the screen size and quality is perfect i added a photo i took from my note  this phone feels great in the hand there really isnt much i cant do with this device,5
this phone is great but i dont get service anywhere have been to att multiple times to fix service issue this phone is brand new my friend has the same phone and it works perfect att said the only thing i could do is get it replaced or get a new phone,1
im loving this phone ive had it for almost a month and im using it through straight talk wireless great features and it arrived in perfect condition i was hesitant to buy such an expensive item used but its perfect thank you,5
first time i have ever ordered a phone very pleased with it its a great phone and it saved me a ton not getting it from verizon no monthly fee for it it might be an older model but its a wonderful phone,5
i got this phone for verizon and it was beautiful but im suspicious about it because it would have horrible reception i many places i had it next to a note  and the note  barely worked this made it unusable i have returned it,1
the phone that i bought did not meet any of my expectations the charger that came with the phone did not fit and the phone kept going off and on it was a terrible experience so i did send the phone back and i was refunded my money,1
the galaxy note  is working out to be just what i was looking for as i said in the title for this review the note  is proving to be almost as good as the note  and its one big feature is that it wont burst into flames in my pocket,5
product arrived on time and looks great charger is some no name brand phone was suppose to come with screen protector and it was not included so i am only giving  stars will rate again later after i have used the phone,4
the samsung galaxy note  has an eyecatching design and highend hardware and takes extraordinary photos using a stylus has never felt better and battery life is extraordinary but on batteries that cannot be removed and there are no external storage options,3
i was very skeptical about the appearance of the phone but it came as if brand new my only problem was my sim card from my note  couldnt fit into the note  my sim was a micro sim and the note  takes nano sims,5
item was listed as new but im pretty sure it was refurbished my phone worked amazing for  weeks then one day my screen would start flashing every time i locked my screen seller refunded my money upon return,2
very satisfied with this purchase bought it for my husband and it was a great upgrade from his note  that he had he gives it a big thumbs up battery life much longer and it has a better operating system and quick response time,5
when i purchased this phone it said it was like new cosmetically but now its showing i received grade b which is a little disappointing its been working as promised though so it was well worth the price and i am definitely satisfied so far,4
i had the note  and the note  is a nice improvement over it this phone is fast takes awesome pictures and samsung pay is the best only thing i miss is the ir blaster remote capability the phone was in great shape and love the price for a used phone,5
when i recd this phone i took it to the local att store for setup installed a new sim card agent was unable to complete the setup cannot send or receive phone calls or voicemails would like a refund please,2
bought this advertised as brand newverizongsm unlocked phone is  verizon locked and will not accept any carriers other than verizon didnt know how to return my item so i guess im out a nice chunkof money fix your descriptions,1
he arrived on time  the phone its fine  it has few lines but its fine  it works perfectly  but the battery like it wears out quickly  i do not know if its because of the operating system or if the battery is bad im going to eg,4
i bought the white color of this phone when the phone screen was cracked i sent it to samsung for repair and samsung discovered that the phone original color was black and someone changed it to white my warranty was cancelled due to this selfish ideology,1
made the mistake of switiching from my note  awhile back my wireless provider no longer carries this option was very happy to find my replacement here it works perfectly very happy with this purchase,5
i need help with my cellphone please i can not log in to my account google asks me for an account of the owner of the cell it is possible that the previous owner of the cell phone can delete his google account of note  please,1
love it so much faster than note  and i dont mind that it doesnt have a removable battery or an sd card just make sure you get the gb if you need more storage if you have more than that you should get a storage account,5
absolutely love it no problems besides my sim was too big so i bought more at the walmart for  with a phone card but called straight talk and it is compatible and extremely easy to set up shipment arrived before noon on  day shipping absolutely would do it again,5
works perfectly i was able to activate the phone easily at verizon at no charge the sim card and activation were free the phone arrived on time i am very pleased with my purchase and thrilled to have save almost  of the verizon retail price,5
awesome when i got the phone it looked new there was no indication that it was used the phone was perfect but i got a charger that overheated and contacted the seller and they replied and sent me two fast chargers  buy it now it perfect,5
this phone is great nice size very fast gives you gb of cloud space with one drive great for memo taking office work and signing documents is an added bonus the downsize of course is no removable battery and no expanded memory but otherwise a terrific phone,5
i requestedordered blacki was sent blue phone has had several glitchessoftware bugs purchasing a new phone today because this phone has caused be so many problems in the short time that i have had it this was a bad purchase,1
i only got the gig ive had it for a little longer than a month and it seems like its slowing down a little bit i try to keep my files to a minimum and clean storage space besides that the phone it self is perfect just wish i got one with more memory,4
i brought this phone for my husband as christmas gift and it was working fine but the last couple of months its been acting up and now the phone wont turn on and i need this to be resolve immediately or i want my full refund back,1
didnt buy this through amazon i bought it through verizon in the gb model version cons  no sd card known issues  sim card says ejected every now and then even though verizon is cdma everything else is pretty much perfect,5
the way they make note  is very very stupid the phone do not take ds card who those that a big phone like that i always look samsung galaxy but this one is stupid the pen can go in any how they have to remember we have kids they want to kknow think,1
if your a fan of the samsung galaxy note line you obviously know that the note  is packed full with featuresthis note  arrived on time clean and sharp beast of a device very very happy with this company,5
the phone looses connection i rarely have good phone service i didnt change carriers from my s that i had great service i have taken it to be reset and updated ip settings but still drops my calls i can hear them but they dont hear me,1
i ordered a new device now i find out this device has been rooted which is causing me alot of problems with certain apps i always use most likely means its not new as well why was this not disclosed to me before or upon purchase or accepting payment from me,1
the phone came in and works great it takes a while to get use to the new device but i love all the added features i am still discovering internet calling is a big one before my cell would not work in my house at all,5
great screen very surprised by the top quality refurbished product  tiny dimples on bottom right corner had to look close to see worked fast very good battery life only reason for return was lack of sd card slot,5
this phone will prpbably not explode in your pocket and i really like mine a lot fast light and stylish lack of an additional sd card storage slot is a negative only really minor issue is with the fingerprint unlock function which is more of a software problem,5
phone wasnt as flawless as promised had a few knicks here and there screen seemed to have a particular area that stopped responding to touch or the stylus screen cracked very easily while in case from very slight pressure while trying to edit a s note,2
ive bought two of these note s the first one was great but this second one has very noticeable scratches on the screen and home button and the screen responds slow sometimes and battery life is bad why,2
its been since january since i purchased this phone we love it it was a gift for my wife no problem in getting phone service on it by the way ting is awesome service if you are looking for a provider,5
i dropped my previous galaxy note   broke it and started using an old note  and just wasnt pleased with the upgraded features of the  until i purchased another note  galaxy i love this phone even though its  old,5
do not buy it mine stopped working after a month and i sent it to samsung warranty department they are charging me  to fix the screen problem never been dropped or water damaged there was no warranty came with phone,1
this phone went far beyond my expectations the ability to write notes just as if i had a notepad is exceptional and was what i was wanting this phone is also much faster than what i have been used to and very responsive to voice commands,5
the phone came in appropriate shipping time there was one damaged area located on the bottom of the phone once a cover was placed on it you would never know operations work well and phone seemed to come as advertised,4
it looks new and is working but did not come with anything except the phone not the key to put in a sim card cord or charger wish i had known that so could have ordered them at the same time and not had to wait to use it,3
very fair price great flawless quality for a refurbished phone works wonderfully only bummer was that it doesnt come with an sd card but thankfully that wasnt an issue or an extra charge for me thru my carrier,5
this is an awesome piece of design hardware i love it and although i like the note  settings layout more the k camera on this phone used compared to buying a k camera as a camera makes it extraordinary value and a great phone,5
was leery about buying a reconditioned phone bought the phone over a month ago no problems no issues works great this was replacing a note  that i had dropped the phone was a better price than originally paid for the note ,5
just  days of use  the screen goes off  to a complete horror  byebye the screen is purple it looks like it was dropped in water and kicked around the phone is horrible it didnt last even a month be aware,1
good phone great deal for the price but not perfect if it had  gb of memory i would give it a better rating the problem is alot of apps wont load on the memory card so they take up space on the phone,3
httpswwwamazoncomsamsunggalaxyjsmartphoneinternationaldpbgcgrefsr__swirelessieutfqidsrkeywosamsung galaxy j smjhds gsm factory unlocked smartphone international version goldrdssamsungjunlocked,5
i like the phone and the samsung awesome features however i seem to already have a problem with space on the harddrive seems that it comes with about gb worth of programs which does not leave you with much space to download new apps even with a sd card,3
products seem very light weight feels like its gonna break samsung is losing the quality now a days i am not assuming this from this product only i got refrigerator from samsung which makes noise for no reason and its very loud,3
so far working great however one phone has low storage straight from the begining after restoring my apps and the camera continually fails however i have recently purchased a larger microsd card with hopes that with better storage the camera would stop failling,4
it should not be advertised that the phone has an expandable memoryit seems like samsung took out the feature to configure a microsd card as internal memory therefore it doesnt have an expandable memory to  gb you will be stuck with  gb,1
it has serious issues i gifted it to my father as his old mobile was old and he just started using it the play store is not working properly so its not possible to install apps its useless to him i feel bad that i gifted it to my dad,2
i need the power plug to reconnect the charger because i am in the usa not in europe it is a second one to plug it into the outlet on the wall my phone came without that second one calaxyj smjhemotional version thanks best regards alvaro prada,5
if you are a high maintenance user gb just wont do it for you you get around gbs due to samsungs excessive bloatware noone wants  always having to delete stuff even though i transfer stuff to the memory card,3
great phone its fast and is the full package as a smartphone what extremely irked me was the dastardly slow and useless service this phone seemed to receieve and if that wasnt enough the head phone jack ceased to work after a single month,3
worst cell phone ever i am truly sorry i decided to buy it after seeing the bad reviews i thought it couldnt be that bad since some persons had positive reviews it worked fine for a month after which the home search and back keys stopped working,1
this is a good phone easy to use the only fault i find is that it does not give the option to group numbers enter email addresses nor home addresses if a person has more than one phone numbers they have to be entered individually,4
i purchased this phone from best buy less than four months ago and the display died abruptly now i have to waste time dealing with samsungs warranty processgarbage product not even worth onestar avoid at all cost,1
the phone arrived new and in great condition its light and thin i love the color too however i am giving it two stars because it does not work with the service of att or verizon in the united states,2
phone worked for a few days and got stuck on the j logo it stayed like this for months until i tried to follow a youtube video to flash it it was very disappointing but after flashing it it works fine,4
i purchased this phone in march  and it still works very well works perfectly fine in the bahamas and when i go to the us only issue is that i had to replace the battery last month because it was swollen,4
not happy with this phone no space on it to even update apps my own fault neglected to look at the space on it does anyone have any suggestions wish we could get rid of some of the useless preloaded apps,2
this mobile is everything i expected it to be i am very satisfied with the gold color and the thinness of the mobile looks very stylish and the picture quality is magnificent very much pleased thank you it was delivered on time with no damages,5
although i mistakenly ordered this product i must admit it was great service and product arrived in great conditions no scratches all accessories included  recommended i know i have to return it despite my desires of keeping it,5
it arrived damaged the motherboard has a failure that causes the consumption to raise without doing anything killing the battery suddenly it show  charge then if you turn the screen off and blink twice the battery is dead not good item dont buy,1
you say the samsung galaxy j is a dual sim gsm and gsm smartphone that accepts regular and connectivity options include wifi gps bluetooth g g with support for band  used by some lte networks in india but in my g aws network dont work in g why,2
i ordered  of these one for myself and one for my fiance both have terrible battery life maybe  hours both have their own glitches my camera glitches and his power button and home button both glitch very disappointed in these phones,2
i bought this phone for my mom and while it worked well now after two months the battery dies very quickly i am very disappointed as the warranty expired unlike other phones changing the battery is a laborious process buyer beware what you are getting,2
an amazing phone i bought this for my mother in law and she loves it not it is not the latest and greatest but it is only two versions behind it is perfect for what she needs and has everything she could ever want in a phone and more,5
not quite two weeks in and the phone will randomly restart itself if it is plugged into a charger while you try to use it makes using maps on a long trip very complicated it also will power off when it says it has  battery left,2
bought this for the kid to play his games on over all it has been a decent product was disappointed that it said it was unlocked but was not if we decide to hook it to a phone number we will need to unlock it or find a new phone,4
this is a great phone and it works well with straight talk i purchase a black one from a different company through amazon and it was prior to this one and it was horrible if you decide to purchase a samsung galaxy mega  get it from this company,5
this phone was sold as refurbished and claimed to be like new but it freezes up constantly opens the wrong apps will not pick up wifi in places my last phone identical to this one did im not satisfied with the performance of this phone at all,2
this phone is not worth over  dollars maybe  ive had this phone for several days and its horrible battery will completely drain in a hour thats with a low dim on the screen glitches consistently freezes constantly i have to restart it all the time,1
i like the phone except there is a small amount of pink on the phone that wasnt mentioned in the description and the phone was for my boyfriend so i dont think he appreciated the pinkbut the phone is good,4
phone arrived on time and in better condition than i expected for a refurbished phone it works flawlessly and getting it activated was simple and easy at the verizon store took about ten minutes i doubt that ill ever buy a new phone from the store again,5
it came way before thursday plus it looks a little bit different than i thought it would also feels like its made to grip or hold onto better which is a plus cause the red one i had was just smooth and slippery,4
works perfectly however you must know a two things  the gsm bands it uses are not used by all carriers  g service is being phased out in the us aside from that the phone is unlocked and functions as it is meant to side note its surprising snappy,5
even though this phone is supposedly paired with a sim card from verizon which i also purchased i was told it was not compatible i was never able to connect it and its just sitting there unused and useless,1
im disappointed in this item imagine receiving a new phone and no earpiece device how am i going to use the radio this is supposed to be an unlocked phone yet it doesnt workcant make a call smh,3
this phone was not unlocked when i received it additionally the package was already opened there were fingerprints on the glossy front case and it had a security code other than the default code or code generated with my iemi do not buy this phone,1
i bought two of these to try out they work fabulous using my existing us tmobile sim cards put them into the sim card kit i also purchased and they worked immediatley clearer to talk and listen on than most newer phones excellent value for money,5
this device is not connecting to my network i belive it is defective i have never bought a phone that does not work i am living in jamaica and this phone is not working this is a fathers day present i need some one to contact me regarding this item,1
worse product ever do not buy it its a scam i would like to give it zero but one is the lowest really upset i bought it for a long trip to europe and i cant even use this stupid phone had to purchase another one waste of money not gsm or unlocked,1
im in love with this phone and it works great was really crushed about note  but this note  works great and have not had a day of trouble with it other than being on the crappy sprint network  great phone pos network stay away from sprint,5
lets v start with the biggest con you cant be on the internet and on the phone at the same time unless you are on wifi which was bs it worked great  did the job just a year later the phone started having malfunctions thankfully i was able to buy a new phone,4
great phone strong battery the vr applications work flawlessly phone is perfect size no slippery sides like my old lg samsung is the best oh yeah the stylus is excellent very reactive and precise touch like a pen and paper,5
i bought this after my original got stolen and i hadnt gotten insurance  a very small scratch was on the home button but everything else was immaculate and it worked smoothly with my verizon account i have had the phone for months with no issue thank you,5
malfunctioned phone  when it arrived it kept telling me to install a software i installed it  times an it kept showing up an popping upthe seller has poor communications  never responds dont buy from this person you will regret it ,5
bought the phone for my daughter  month ago i was worried about buying it online however after a month i can report no problems so far battery holds a great charge phone was new and in original packaging i have been pretty happy so far,5
i have had this phone purchase on amazon for less than  days and i am having issues with the phone turning itself off i am hoping that amazon will help with dealing with the  day warranty but havent heard anything so far,1
i was skeptical reading the reviews because my phone was being ordered for work i am very happy with the phone it looks like it is brand new the battery life is fine and it does what i need for my job great price,5
this is the best device i have ever owned and im going back to  the screen size and quality is perfect i added a photo i took from my note  this phone feels great in the hand there really isnt much i cant do with this device,5
this phone is great but i dont get service anywhere have been to att multiple times to fix service issue this phone is brand new my friend has the same phone and it works perfect att said the only thing i could do is get it replaced or get a new phone,1
im loving this phone ive had it for almost a month and im using it through straight talk wireless great features and it arrived in perfect condition i was hesitant to buy such an expensive item used but its perfect thank you,5
first time i have ever ordered a phone very pleased with it its a great phone and it saved me a ton not getting it from verizon no monthly fee for it it might be an older model but its a wonderful phone,5
i got this phone for verizon and it was beautiful but im suspicious about it because it would have horrible reception i many places i had it next to a note  and the note  barely worked this made it unusable i have returned it,1
the phone that i bought did not meet any of my expectations the charger that came with the phone did not fit and the phone kept going off and on it was a terrible experience so i did send the phone back and i was refunded my money,1
the galaxy note  is working out to be just what i was looking for as i said in the title for this review the note  is proving to be almost as good as the note  and its one big feature is that it wont burst into flames in my pocket,5

was leery about buying a reconditioned phone bought the phone over a month ago no problems no issues works great this was replacing a note  that i had dropped the phone was a better price than originally paid for the note ,5
just  days of use  the screen goes off  to a complete horror  byebye the screen is purple it looks like it was dropped in water and kicked around the phone is horrible it didnt last even a month be aware,1
phone listed as new was not new i have  droid turbo  phones and know what new is also turbo charger is defective not impressed at all for price the turbo  is a good phone but i should have bought local live and learn,1
i am writing this review on the very phone i bought for being a used phone i sure feel like i got a new phone very happy with this phone between the speed and reliability of this phone its has been nothing but short than perfect for me and my business,5
after  months the actual screen started peeling up and bubbling it also had several glitches after less than a year it has now shut down and wont restart i bought this phone because i loved my last one,1
seller sent a phone that doesnt work turns off frequently only one speaker works and the ram clearly was not cleared because frickin advertisements pop up on the phone every few minutes seller refused to acknowledge my concern,1
the good the phone arrived in two days and looked brand new i couldnt have been happierthe bad  from a full charge in the morning i made two text and checked  emails and im at  battery at  am couldnt be me discussed,2
had for  months now and is considerably slower than when i first unboxed it the screen scratches easier than my first and im already regretting now buying a newer phone i had my first for almost  yrs and im just hoping i can get yr out of this one,3
i love how quick this phone is everything seems to flow pretty smooth the camera is awesome however the turbo  has a lot of charging issues mine took  hours to charge to  unfortunately i had to return it,3
at first it charged fine but slowly the port got worse and now its impossible to charge its dead and every time it starts to charge at all it vibrates causing it to stop charging also the screen was burnt when received,2
lots of unnecessary apps and the battery life is minimal have the same model as a work phone with a standby time of  days the one i bought dies in  hours all apps do work correctly and visually looks and feels like new,4
the pixels in the screen are damaged when purchased and the phone continues to shut off on its own and the only way it will come back in is to be connected to a charger cord i would not recommend this product as a good purchase,1
i received the package early no cracks obviously no scratches on the screen minimal drop damage it is running android  all around fully functional although i was disappointed that it didnt come with the turbo charger,4
phone broke no physical damage done just quit working took it to the local verizon store and they couldnt get it to work took it to a tech guy and he couldnt get it to work no water damage nothing just quit working very upset,1
the droid turbo  is a great phone i was reluctant to give up my indestructible motorola flip phone which i used in my construction business then i discovered the droid i put it in an otterbox defender case and i dont worry about taking it on the job,5
not a single scratch on this phone amazing shape i upgraded it to android  still has a great battery life i would go ahead and purchase a fast charging cable the one that did come with it takes up to  hours for a full charge,5
i ordered  of these phones for me and my wife payed  a pice for brand new neither phone charging port worked had to buy wireless chargers to charge them and the were not brand new they were certified refurbished and it said new not happy at all,1
i purchased phone received it in a timely manner and within  days it quit charging i was told by several repair people that the charge port is microsaudered and its  to fix it im now stuck with a phone that wont charge,1
charger is dangerous received today and caused circuit breaker to trip upon plugging in tried again with the phone not plugged in and it exploded internally also sim card was not included despite it being on the items included,1
i received my phone  days ago and although the phone is absolutely amazing and the features come in quite handy on a day to day basis buying this phone refurbished it will not receive a charge so will have to return it in hopes i get one that does,4
i was wanting a phone with a great camera that was my number one thing verizon suggested this phone the camera isnt that great the phone freezes terribly and apps constantly close i cannot wait to get a new phone,1
this phone fell out of my pocket on a rollercoaster with no case on it and it is completely fine there is a dent in the top near the headphone jack but it still works with headphones i couldnt recommend it more to the accidentprone,5
battery would not charge out of the box i figured out that if i turned the phone off and plugged in the charger then turned the phone on it would charge sometimes when it would actually charge it would randomly drop charge level by  to  certified,1
not worth it everything started about this phone is untrue not worth the hype shuts off by itself after a few months of use no available updates i could continue but im using the phone to do this and im sure im limited in time before the next shut down,2
this phone only lasted  months the battery would only last a few hours and suddenly shut down even if it had  percent of battery power the screen had grunge around the edges it was basically someones old phone waste of money,2
ive had two of this exact phone before this seller though never again phone stopped charging and is essentially useless now its not the cord or the turbo charging block since ive switched both of them out to no avail,1
i am having issues with charging the phone is there a trick to it i have had the phone about  hours on constant charge and still the battery is only at  thats the highest ive seen usually it is at ,1
the phone that i received was defective but the build of it was amazing it did get pretty hot at times but the signal strength was second to none and the speed of it was very snappy i am going to order another one hands down one of the best smart phones out,5
its an awesome phonebut you need to get a replacement every  months as the screen dies im already on my rd phone and it hasnt even been a year stay away from motorola they have po terrible customer service and defective products ,2
i had the previous version and plan on sticking with the next version the battery is incredible with light usage lasted up to  hours with heavy usage it lasted an  hour day its also rugged and resistant to falls i,5
was not boost mobile friendly bought this for my daughter she tried to activate by phone they couldnt help her so they asked her to take it into a boost mobile store they told her this phone was not compliant with their service,1

samsung galaxy s gb black sphlt triband boost mobile new in box with sim card i already have a boost account and i activated this phone online took about  minutes let it run through all of the updates great phone exactly as described by seller,5
this phone is great i love it only problem i had was it had a sprint card in it when i went to boost mobile to have it turn on the sprint chip they had a problem in turning on the phone but all work out great love this phone,4
i like the samsung galaxy s very much because it has all the features that i look for in a phone i bought this as a replacement for one that i had broken love the samsung galaxy phones have not been happy with any other brand that i have tried,5
the phone failed to download apps from play store it took forever it failed to send out pictures i returned the phone and brought a phone from boost mobile website instead i like the amazon return services return the phone was very easy,1
ordered one for my girlfriend wasnt to sure boost would activate it but they did phone is brand new came with its own galaxy s box now ibthink my nexr phone i will order it here much cheaper then if you get it from the store,5
over all good conditionmust have been in a case much of its life due to being relatively free of scratches runs well for am older phone and can hold its own to many newer phones costing much more money very happy with it so farwell see how it goes,5
it has boost mobile attached as the carrier and my experience with them after returning the phone for other reasons has been completely negative the phone is probably a good thing but boost mobile is a ripoff,2
phone was just as they said it was refurbished and looks bran new not even a scratch on the phone and works with page plusthis phone is awesome and for the price you cant beat it  i would buy from them again,5
very fast delivery my phone has been working great so far which is good in comparison to the other company i bought my other droid turbo  from it gets so much better signal than my old phone and i was able to put it on my verizon prepaid plan,5
very disappointed in this unit notification didnt work right apps that i use daily wouldnt load after talking with verizon and them sending me to motorola i one has to believe its just a cheaper phone made for verizon,1
i am very pleased with this phone i bought mine refurbished and it is like new functioning great and swapping my sim card over was a breeze i am enjoying the extra memory over the gb droid maxx i had before,5
bought this for my boyfriend who loves it had to buy it twice though because the first refurbished phone he received was buggy and completely shut down the first day had to send it back and get another thank goodness for amazons return policy,4
i really like the motorola droid  i especially like the turbo charger which this phone did not come with fortunately i already have one there are only  screens for apps but otherwise i really like this phone the battery life is great and the price even better,4
the phone itself works fine unless you want to use anything with location services if i try to use my gps or an app like pokemon go it shows my location way off point i cant even follow my gps because my phone thinks im blocks away,3
i got this from amazon and when i took it out of the box i saw scratches the first day i got it i plugged it into the charger it kept charging and then not charging i bought two new charging cords and it didnt work it still wont charge,2
received what was described wish i would have went ahead and sprung for the motorola droid turbo  i now want to upgrade but will lose too much money trading this one in or selling it now like they say hindsights always ,5
purchased this thinking it would be a good product it lasted  months and stated locking up and not responding i looked on here an only has a  warranty way to stand behind your product feeling bad and wont purchase anymore eletronics from heresad,1
have had phone for just over a month and it already does not charge properly chargers all work fine on other phones but not this one really disappointed i wasted the money only to have to switch phones after a month,1
warning this product comes with an aftermarket charger you can not do the turbo charging the item description is incorrect if i would have known i would have bought it from someone else the charger alone at the verizon store is ,1
this phone does the job very solid built well a little heavy bloated with unnecessary softwarebut so is every other device you buy these days screen resolution is a little above par everything else meets standards battery life is pretty good as well,3
do not buy this phone ive had two it is a hassle to charge most chargers wont work after had about  months you will have charging issues do not buy this phone its terrible phone is no good if it wont even charge,1
loved this phone the only thing is my lte signal i used it with tmobile signal is erratic but besides that the phone is of great quality and gorgeous screen not to mention battery will last a day or two,4
it was to come with a turbo charger and it did not the charger they sent lasted a week and didnt work anymore battery life is poor but great phone had the original for  yrs and was pleased to find the same phone referbished,5
the phone was pirate because it wasnt the original phone  it didnt have features like the original phone the charger was all scratched up seem that it was used sorry it was used  so if you decide to buy this phone you know what to expect,2
my phone is working perfectly fine except for the fact that the mic will not work at all i have tried everything to get it to work but it will not work i am refunding and if there is a good and tested phone ready i will buy again,2
i ordered one of these as my son had cracked his and the power button was messed up somehow it worked so well i ordered another for my other son when his cracked as well since we are not eligible for upgrades yet thank you,5
husband broke his phone and had no insurance this phone was a great replacement arrived quickly it has a large screen and takes way better pictures than the galaxy s which he had before would definately buy again,5
the charging port is completely defective and there is no way to exchange the product i just essentially have to be without a phone now for days again because i was sent a defective phone i am terribly dissatisfied because i love the phone,2
a very clean like new note but have to reset the sim almost daily message no sim card restart also has a stiff upvolume button i like the phone but i am pretty sure these are the reasons someone returned it and now i have a refurb phone,4
this was supposed to be a new phone but after only two months it is starting to act up glitches with ads and pop ups all the time shuts down with the saying unfortunately note has stopped extremely disappointed and dissatisfied,1
i purchased the phone as a refurbished phone which should have not sign of use however the home button is scratched up and gets stuck a bit in the back the camera light also has a scratch in the glass not very happy with my purchase,3
great phone beautiful shape spen works perfectly and the new click feature really makes it feel higherend the battery is the only downfalli barely get  hours of use out of it when i am playing games or on the internet otherwise definitely recommended,5
garbage used it one week and it locked up on tmobile screen cant remove battery on note  also when i received it it would not let me use android or samsung pay because it said the phone had been rooted with other software did seller verify phone work,1
phone arrived in time had to charge it up everything worked except the speaker  no hands free and the samsung pay app would not work error message said unauthorized modification had been done even after factory reset sent it back for full refund,1
i bought this phone and as certified refurbished and all i have to say is it look brandnew when it arrived it actually arrived two days before expected date i could not be any more satisfied i actually even bought another one for my partner i recommend this note ,5
i always get my phone to used from amazon so far ive been happy with them only one time the charger plug wouldnt stay plugged in i contacted the seller they immediately sent me a new one that worked perfectly,5
had this phone since july  it started to run extremely slow around november  dropped calls even with full service would not hold charge touch screen was shotty okay for a loaner until you can get better phone but definitely not built to last,2
i ordered my samsung  from the seller legend wireless i paid for a gold s and received a black s and it was also delivered late and it was a usedrefurbished phone and its damaged at the top talk about a bad deal,1
difficult to trust any cell phone purchase on amazon two consectutive new s phones in a row had to be returned neither was actually new and both had major issues i was not the first or only person to experience this as i read the other comments,1
works fine but the screen was burned when it arrived the previous owner clearly did a lot of driving because their navigation app is permanently imprinted on it its not unusable but replacing the screen would cost more than i payed for the device,2
absolutely garbage phone this was supposed to be a brand new phone but the battery life is just horrible it will show  battery life and next thing you know is your phone died do not buy this phone from amazon feel this is refurbished,1
the product came as described and delivery was quick the seller was very helpful in communicating with me via email as i was a bit nervous buying a phone online ive had it now for a month now and everything works great,5
imei was not fully paid off i went to verizon and they told me that the imei was not paid off this means that they sell stolen phones i repeat do not buy these phones they have a good chance of being previously stolen,1
phone was cheapbut i guess thats the danger bought this s from solar tech llc check out the home button there is a gashmajor chipping all around it which is much more wear and tear than they advertise returning now hoping for a better one,2
it all works well except i tried several times to update it and it keep an telling me to needs updated after ive turned it off and on already otherwise it was fine for the money i paid i didnt care for the case i bought so much though,3
i am convinced that this phone was not new it over heats immensely and i have only been using  days the back glass also look s as tho it has been opened and was not replaced properly i even received my package without the earbuds,1
 star phone is in surprisingly good condition product exceeded expectations at first the battery seemed to get to hot but that seemed to be remedied after a software upgrade will continue to monitor but so far a,5
this phone would randomly shut down at  charge left a full charge only last about an hour this started about  months after my purchase the return window has past stuck with an expensive peice of trash,1
its barely five months old it quit working took it to a repair shop and they said the motherboard was bad cant believe a brand new phone went bad that fast thinking somebody sold us a refurbished phone for new,2
 months old and battery swelled up forcing the back off not waterproof when that happens samsung is finally honoring warranty they should stick to tvs my ss washing machine needed recall repairs bought extended warranty for the frig,1
it appears that my battery does not last all day it was charged at  this morning and its only  am and im down to  and yesterday was the first day i used it and i had to charge it what can i do,1
screen smashed in  weeks total failure in a month very very poor design check the reviews on google first everyone has broken their phones right off the bat i will not buy another samsung phone ever,5
i received the gold s three days ago and i am  satisfied i noticed on a previous review someone had an issue with head phone capability regular head phones do work with my phone i have not had any complications great phone i am very pleased,4
i purchased used for my wife the phone was abut dirty and didnt come with original packaging but works great the hardware and weatherproofing put iphone to shame the strogest aspect to this phone is the price and the power and functionality,4
well the phone works fine dont know if it was brand new sealed but might have been a demo or something but no big deal waited for a long time before review to make sure had no issues with the phone thanks,5
i upgraded to the s from the s and am finding it great so far it looks really nice and i like the wallpaper theme i found on the phone ive had several samsung galaxy sx phone so far and liked them all,5
exactly how it was described brand new with casing headphones and charger unlocked i simply inserted my sim card and it has been working great the price for it was fair and saved from getting into a phone contract thanks,5
have not even had it for a month and the speaker is not working properly you hear a scratchy very low quality sound as if the speaker is blown out it fixes itself if i reset the phone but comes back daily very annoying and not satisfied,1
this phone has been fine however i paid for what i thought was a totally new phone only to be told later by my verizon dealer that in fact the phone had been registered to an owner before and possibly even used briefly,1
great phone works perfectly and allows me to remain out of contract with verizon which sames me a bundle buying the latest newest phone year after year is a waste of money especially if its done with your carrier literally ive saved thousands over the years,5
this phone was as described appeared new in box arrived on time and works well it came with all accessories and i will update if i have any issues it was a very good price for a huge upgrade from my s,5
i purchased this phone because it was inexpensive and sold in the condition new howeverthe screen broke and i took it to a samsung service center only to find out that the phone is not new and they would not repair it beware when purchasing,1
great phone just as describednew sealed in box sold thru recell took to verizon and they had it activated in under  minutes had an old samsung s and this upgrade to an s is great meets all my needs and very easy to use,5
i have not noticed a single negative thing about this phone so far i got it refurbished and its working beautifully granted ive only been using it for like  days but nothings going wrong on it other than the obscene amount of updates i had to do with the beginning,5
works great i was using a cheapie smartphone and decided to invest in this its well worth it those cheapies are hard to use this one is way easier to figure out more user friendly and much easier to find accessories for,5
i had to return my phone after a few days when i discovered that the earphones microphone was not working it was an issue with the phone the same earphones worked on other phones the home button also felt wierd as if it was gettting stuck not a smooth movement,1
i bought  of these phones and both have an issue with updates a message appears that says to update when you press yes it goes into a continuous loop showing the update message again and againand again,3
bought used good condition from privi storefront less than  so far has exceeded my expectations looks nearly brand new phone works great with much better battery consumption than my galaxy s very happy,5
came from the seller allout mobile in a timely manner and i have loved it ever since i was worried about the battery life but the battery is fine and lasts over a day with regular use and proper charging,5
verizon would not allow this phone to be activated on their network as it was stolen and never fully paid for by a previous customer  year old christmas disappointment recommended to amazon that their rd party vendors need to be double checked,1
the product we received was not new at all the sim card and data transfer component was not included in the package when we took the phone to verizon the representative said all new phones come with sim card google unboxing of samsung galaxy s,1
the phone has a great looking screen and is pretty fast i purchased refurbished but returned mine though because it wouldnt stay connected to my cellular network and i have problems receiving and sending texts and calls i suspect a problem with the antenna though,5
product is brand new in factory box with all the goodies does not come with a sim card went to my local verizon store and they installed the card and did the start up for free phone works perfect very happy with this purchase,5
bought this for my son as a replacement phone of his samsung galaxy s that started having issues hes had it a few weeks and says he loves it way better than his samsung galaxy s hes very pleased with it as that makes me happy it was a great purchase,5
i just recently gave up my  year old flip phone for this gal s  i love how this cell phone works  its features and what it can do  my big complaint is the size  just too big for a guy to carry around ,5
this phone is awesome i upgraded from an s mini this company sent me a new phone with all the accessories in the original box exactly as adveertised everything was super clean and untouched i would recommend buying from this seller,5
dont know why i keep going with the galaxy but i am happy with it battery and storage makes this a much better phone than the  i have not tested its ability to go under water yet not sure if i am that brave,4
i have sent it back this telephone did not work properly i will never by another telephone on line again it is too difficult when you have trouble with the product when ordered it i thought it was a new phone my error i didnt read the add properly,1
note i have a iphone now this phone is way better than my j  this is really quick and has a really quick snapdragon  processor it does heat up quick when charging though just to warn you the heating up is not too bad at least must buy,4
i love the phone its getting me throw the day so far its fast good camera but its just my personal opinion the glass back in had a lg g with extended battery and love it but im okay with it sense i can put my micro sd in it,4
i was real skeptical about buying a refurbished phone on the internet but after receiving my new phone it is perfect as if it was bought from the phone store zero flaws works great and yes it can be used on prepaid with verizon absolutely loving it,5
this product really works as i hoped it would and i would highly suggest that everyone buy this product it met and exceeded my expectations please give this product a try and i promise you will not be disappointed thanks for reading this and hope you get this,5
the phone came and was great but it did not come with the key for putting your sd card and simple card in i never got a reply from the seller about it either i went to the verizon store and they sorted it for me love the phone though and it works perfect,4
this is an example of difference between excellent condition and good the home button is clearly discolored but phone is fully functional so it serves its purpose an accurate picture would have been better,3
i love my galaxy s edge i switched back to android from iphone and couldnt be more pleased the only complaint is have is that there are no screen protectors that dont curl up or fit with a case my screen is already scratched,5
i did not realize volume did not work i always use ear bugs to talk when i did not use the ear bugs as i left them home is when i realized the volume does not work with ear to phone but it did work with the speaker crazy,1
the description says it is but it is not i checked with seller after i received it and they confirmed it is tmobile only they did accept my return only writing this because the information has not been corrected,3
the phone was brand new in a factory sealed box with tmobile product inserts and all accessories inserting a tmobile sim card brought it up on their network with no problem and no need for further activation,5
bought this phone and was so disappointed phone clearly said gb on the phone and the packaging but when i installed app no space only to see its only  gb to late to return it will because of where i am now,1
i am loving this phone i had a note  before upgrading to the v i guess im too used to samsung as i returned the v and went with this i am not disappointed shipping with prime was fastlike amazingly so,5
it worked for a solid  days perfect and then i charged it and woke up to realize the screen cuts in and out i havent dropped it nor has it left my room i used it to watch youtube and spotify and use social media  i thought amazon was better than ebay,1
i had an old s that was getting slower by the minute and i couldnt afford a new s so i ordered this s and i am very pleased with the phone the storage the life of the battery the new features everything is great really happy i made this purchase,5
came as advertised with very little wear and tear the home button sticks but other than that and the fact that i had to update everything which took hours i havent had any problems its much better than v that i was using,4
worked great straight out the box no scratches on the screen at all looks new was able to activate one i picked up a sim card no problem there are plenty of updates to do but that is to be expected very happy with this purchase,4
ive had this phone for about months and had nothing but issues gps went out on it  camera went out spent  hours getting it fixed by techs  cant be fixed i feel like buying any electronics from amazon is bad idea after multiple issues,1
came in two days good shape for being a three year old phone got a free sim from the sprint store and online setup took a few minutes batteries on these suck but hell the price is right and my mother in law is happy,5
i paid the extra money for a new s the box states that a sim card is installed see picture the sim card was not installed now we have to drive all the way in to a sprint service center to get one there better not be a charge or this is going back,1
ive been thru  phones used  new trying to get a decent priced phone that works on boost mobile samsung galaxy s is finally it this  year old samsung phone is better than a new motorola phone battery is okay but not great im very happy with this phone,5
 just received my phone today as far so good attached are the pictures of what i received in my package only thing not pictured was the metal tool to pop out the sim card tray overall very pleased with what i received,5
just got the phone and it was att variant every thing looks ok but it wont work with tmobile wifi because the roms are not tmobile disappointing and not what i would call  compatible with tmobile,3
scammer stay away phone took about five days after first charge to turn on phone turns off randomly and battery dies quickly just like an old phone old phone that was clearly factory resetted have old version of software from  and wont update,1
received the phone quickly and it looked as described when setting up the phone we were unable to get the wireless networking to connect anywhere i returned the phone and the seller provided a quick refund,1
this is a sleek handsome phone however it is riddled with att apps which i have no interest in i had to delete or disable them what it allowed me to it should be more prominently advertised as being partnered with this mobile company,3
the phone has a few hits as expectedthe front button its all scratched and it should not be in that kind of condition finally the charger came broken the plastic on the edge of the cord that connects with the phone has its metal exposed,2
received quickly and just as promised the only problem is that is still has all the software from the previous service carrier which i have been unable to remove otherwise works great and a good value,4
the phone itself is an absolute  rating however the bloatware from the korean rd party was not expected and although i was able to disable it olleh it still continues to display the logo at startup,4
this phone is not factory new the box and plastic screen cover hand finger prints all over it it was loose in the box the data cord socket had scratches on it yes it has a warranty but so does an official refurbished phone and thats much cheaper,1
a nice device for sure but as others have said this is not truly an unlocked phone it is set up for att also the battery drains very quickly possible due to all the bloatware preinstalled sending back to amazon,2
cant really answer alot about this because once i got it the phone would turn on i could here it but the screen never turned on will end up taking it to a cell phone doctor for screen replacement hopefully that will save it,1
awesome phone excellent price it arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised and expected i had no issues getting it setup and working on my network which is consumer cellular very happy with my purchase,5
the phone its self worked fine but i could not get signal with it anywhere i got signal a couple of times but i ended up having to return it the process was very quick and easy im satisfied with the service,3
i just bought this last yr n im already having problems with it very pissed off my screen color keeps changing and my screen has this grey bottom on my screen keeps coming back n going away phone keeps freezing to,2
the phone seems fantastic when it chooses to recognize my sim card but so far the cell i received from them i have had to remove and reinsert my son card at least two times a day sometimes more often and is very frustrating,1
stays charged for at least  days on a single charge has great features tells you when you have too many open aps i had a note  before wouldnt hold a charge even with a new battery im highly satisfied with this phone,5
when i recieved the phone in the box it was obviously repackaged and used then while trying to activate it found out it was not unlocked either obviously neither of these advertised selling points of this phone are true,1
after a few months the phone is acting very weird i keep missing phone calls and do not show the missing calls in the log i can not make phone calls either nt the best product i love samsung but this phone is junk,1
camera never worked from day  noticed a crack down the back of the phone charger literally got so hot it melted and found out you cant use the flashlight when the phone thinks the camera is in use very frustrating experience,1
i only tested the phone and i like it i didnt rate the battery because im planninh to give it to another person it was good to make a deal with you and i hope that the company keeps a great job best januario kiendo,5
bought this phone for my husband after i had gotten one just like it problem is he complained about how slow it charged mine was immediate at charging used my charger and it charged quickly the accessories sent with it didnt work properly,3
i ordered this phone january  and it has been having issues since currently i have to charge the battery several times a day for it to work it turns off randomly as well it is overall a poor quality phone,2
cheaply priced only problems are battery life lasts maximum of  hours only sign of use was a small discoloration on the bottom corner right below and to the left of the home button did not effect use phone is fully water proof and has been tested,5
advertised as att unlocked phone but when i brought it to the att store and purchased a sim card for it it was a t mobile phone want work with an att account dont buy this phone if you have an att account false advertisement,1
bought this phone for my mom and she loved it a upgrade from what she had had a problem with the phone and the seller took care of it right away very good communication and very nice no problems now we love the phone,5
to many att appsthe processor is slower than i expectedi also expected more battery hoursa constant notifications alert most of the timehowevergood screen sizesharp images and colorin the future i would purchase a factory unlocked unit,3
my s came unlocked and it was so easy to put in my sim card and begin to transfer all of my apps it looked like a brand new one no scratches no blemish i was so happy i love the phone it has s great camera easy to use the price was the greatest,5
yes i had to givelow stars i do like the phone yes s is a very good phone yes supposed to be brandnew yes but my sons very techsavvy and it says its refurbished im very upset am i going to return it no,1
i needed to replace my edge  but wasnt looking for the latest and greatest this was just what i was looking for and it is unlocked so any gsm provider sim works i got a used model but in good condition and so far woks perfectly for under ,5
seems like a used battery life after the st month went so bad after charging i could use it only for  hours also keeps connecting and disconnecting while charging on usb connected with computer never again from this seller,1
you cant really see the diffrence between this referbished one to a brand new one amazing phone great price way better than arrogant apple very durable already have it for  years and dont have any problem,5
the phones are definitely not new as described when purchased phones seems to be unlocked but cant get any updates ota so prepare to flash systems images manually if you want to keep the phones up to date with software updates,2
ive been a fan of the galaxy series since i bought my first one this latest installment has not disappointed me im enjoying all the features of the g and im learning new things constantly its a lot faster than my old phone and i have zero complaints thus far,5
this is the third s i have purchased two from my carrier when one broke i found the best avenue was to purchase this for my gsm network works great not one issue no contract i would definitely recommend this product,5
when i received the phone it wasnt in a sleeve it was just the box which was not tapped to prevent the box from opening it was missing the owners manual and the small key to remove the back of the phone the phone looked like a return it didnt look new,1
i love the phone it has worked great for a year today i did have a mishap and the screen gradually turned purple then totally black within about  hours its  to replace screens on these just so yall know i even had a case on it,5
great phone it was unlocked as they said it would be am so thankful for that ive had experience with buying phone online and having to send it back because its not unlocked but this one was as promised,5
arrived a couple days after ordering in brand new packaging all accessories included usbcharger ear buds and key for the sdsim excellent condition works great on my straight talk plan good signal would recommend this,5
very unhappy about the edge miss touch all the time cause when you hold it you are touching the edge which is super sensitive the camera lens got broken by itself wtf now its also having issue charging this is my first also last samsung phone,1
this phone went out within six months of use samsung would not honor the  month warranty and the said amazon should not be selling international phones that can not be fixed here in america amazon has a one month return policy,1
i am not able switch on my mobile since today morning the last used yesterday night and when i woke up in morning i found my mobile was totally dead even not charging also kindly help me to find the solution,1
excellent phone but its not easy to hold safely and you have to catch it from the very thin frame if you dont want to put the screen at work that feature make it slippery not recommended for big hands ,4
i bought this phone for my husband as a birthday gift and it started malfunctioning within  month some lines are on the screen a technician looked at it and said its a refurbished phone no star is my rating but since i have to select star i give one,1
the phones box had been opened when recieved the product i dont kno if it was the manufacturer who cut the temper seal phone is fine but the network is limited it doesnt support tmobile as much as it said it did,3
i received the package open the wall charger inside the package it was for uk i expected to receive the us connector the phone recently it was completely dead i need to did a procedure to re start it for these reasons i was no satisfied with my purchase,3
ordered galaxy s smgf   received galaxy s smgv the v version is the verison version of this product which i dont want and incidentally is much cheaper than the f version which it what i paid for,1
the phone is great in every respect except for the edges i kept getting false imputs due to nottoogreat palm rejection a shame i would have loved a flat s with the  inch display and bigger battery,3
could have been a solid  stars but none of the plugs that were sent with the phone work in the caribbean they are for europe overall good quality product nice finish plastic covering and everything still intact happy with the purchase,4
the phone came with nonfunctioning power and volume buttons missing sim card ejector tool manual and outer box its preinstalled with att apps which cannot be uninstalled not sure if it would work in india returned,1
everything was fine with the phonewas having problem with obtaining sim card that will work internationally since it was sent to someone in another countrywhat would your recommendation be in this situation just curious,5
i love the phone but the wall adaptor is unable to work with my outlets and i tried using a different one and it literally took hr to charge and has a message saying due to the charge the phone is charging at the slowest rate,4
did not come with the original adapter s comes with fast charge version i write to the seller and i do not get an answer also the phone has certain flaws as it closes the apps suddenly and sometimes the screen freezes very disappointed,1
good phone works great on att they cant block wifi hotspot with this phone i have unlimited data grandfathered but was never able to use my phone as a hotspot with an att phone only drawback is it comes with a european wall plug,5
excellent phone i just wish it had all the bands of the phones so you can switch to any carrier like the nexus phones and samsung pay wish it had but i know because its international it couldnt but well made ,4
after a few hours of useunexpectly turned offthen it begins lagging and acting weirdjust talk to amazon for help they didnt help me because it was bought through a freight forwarderi really feel like a wasted my savings for nothing,1
received i phone charging cord no samsung cord in box no us adapter for intl electrical plug the past   intl phones all came with adapter for north american electrical outlets please send along and then we can have  stars thanks k,2
the phone is working well but the chargers adapter cant be used in the us i would like if the company can send me a charger to use to charge my phone apart from that all is good about the phone does it have a warranty tho  if it does how long,4
the samsung galaxy s edge definitely has a distinct class in every regard looks experience and reliability for daily usage definitely is worth the money having purchased this phone for over five months now the experience hasnt gotten old not one bit,5
i purchased it for my gf she loves itit was in gsm so the day i received it i went to walmart purchased a mano sim for  go phone pop it in and it works great she still playing with it and learning the many feature,5
why is this phone uae version all support is in arabic i had to reset everything to american english now i have to leave it with the tech guys for a week to make sure there is no spyware or malware besides that its fine,1
exactly as promised was worried i wouldnt be able to activate it with an american carrier since the included documentation indicated that might be a problem as opposed to requiring a european carrier to activate it first but it worked fine,5
great phone i have been using this for almost a year now and have had no problems with it this was my first foray into android and ive been loving it the phone is currently rooted tripped the frp lock accidentally but if youre careful there will be no problems,5
the phone it is ok but the charger dont work it for me i am from latino america and the charger have an entrance different now i am looking for a charger in my country i paid  and i can not charge my smartphone,2
horrible phone used to be quick however the updates ruined this phone so damn slow at the worst times and the new updates for it just come up with an error so i have a constant update notification popup that is insanely frustrating,2
flawless speed and functioning everything on this phone is seamless and easy to use if transferring from a previous samsung it is even easier they put the external memory option back on this phone too battery life is extraordinary,5
ive sent this as a birthday and anniversary gift for my girlfriend and i was thinking they would send her a used or different phone because she works in uae ive picked the best seller and put my trust on them in the end it worked all great,5
i bought this on june  and last month a pink line is sowing in the middle of the screen check the internet and its a common factory issue that the warranty covers but as they sell this with no guaranty i am stuck with a factory defective screen,2
for the us version make sure the model number is gu unlocked or not or anything with u that u is very important if u wanna make sure g lte bands will work here in us the downside is they are expensive,3
this is for a review of the s edge everything about the phone is great except the phone i have never had or seen a phone that gets such poor reception my s worked great had  better reception than the s edge if i could i would return it and go back to the s,1
saw many of s cracked screen on ebay i was very hopping that s is improved version but  owned it for  days and today had sooo unpleasant surprise to see the screen cracked right where edge it there was no impact its just cracked by it self,1
hi there i ordered this samsung galaxy s on jun  nd everything was very very great until  week ago i just realized that in the screen there is one pixel wrong is almost imperseptible but if you focus on this pixel you can see how s it looks like,1
great phone great display great performance this for the dual sim variant i would suggest to pick up a spare wall charger brick because this one comes with a non  v normally the sellers put an adapter in courtesy not this time other than that im very happy,4
this phone is pretty good but i put my sd card in it and the screen would freeze and restart the phone  i took it out and its working amazingly now thats the only reason i gave it four stars but i love the phone would buy again,4
no wifi calling i did call samsung tech support they have no record of my phonelike not exist you get notting from samsung support  if you by it your are on yourself what a garbagenever by a phone online again,1
phone gets hotter every time i use itinternet apps calling videos images etc and on to last week my phone was completely dead after it was been hotter for more than hr and suddenly it got dead for no reason,2
this phone is amazing we travel alot internationally and this phone allows us to buy prepaid sims and just throw them in the nd slot and thats it has worked in alot of countries unblocked no hastle and a top of line model,5
this phone is everything a phone should be it is beautiful capable powerful and did i mention beautiful honestly take a look at this phone it is simple yet elegant such a great device good job samsung,5
this was a great buy it definitely is like new i actually get the impression that the phone was never even used but simply an item someone returned because they bought the wrong model the phone is working excellently and is aesthetically pleasing,5
perfect replacement for my old phone which i was using for a couple of months before buying this i went through many reviews online to make sure i dont get disappointed after buying this was happy to make a good choice and so far has been a good experience,5
i love this phone dual sim as promised very sleek and not bulky at all setup was a bit wonky for me but i was lucky the guys at att were able to fix it however it doesnt work with samsung pay which is available in the us but i dont mind that,5
great device with so much to offer i recommend buying from the seller mobiles international llc they sent a new and reliable device and honored a warranty for a defective product on samsungs behalf ,5
this is the first phone ive had that didnt annoy me with its sluggishness battery lasts a long time update the phone is now broken for no reason other than what i assume is planned obsolescence samsung hasnt responded to my request for service,1
the phone is amazing the screen is simply the best on the market right now i read different comments about unreliable sellers selling fake or refurbished phones i was lucky i bought mine from seller thecoos got the phone new as described without problem,5
the phone reboot again and again ive used just about  months samsung says that de cant guaraanted cause you buy it on virtual store and amazon close contact seller window  i feel so stole really really it sucks no buy samsung on amazon dont do it,1
at first i gave this  stars now im giving it one because it has a vertical pink line going up and down the phone i spent a crap load of money on this phone for it to be doing this i will give it  stars again once the problem is fixed or phone is replaced,1
do not buy this piece of garbage if you break it it cost  to repai it it broke the first time i dropped it i called samsung and they said our technicians cant currently repair galaxy s edge phones back to iphone,1
im not sure why samsung thinks it is a good idea to make the back out of such a fragile piece of glass but mine shattered from being dropped two feet on my carpeted floor maybe they should focus on a durability rather than mimicking apples terrible designs,1
my work phone is a galaxy s i hate this phone does things that i dont want it to its slow and the camara isnt that good my lg g is a better phone and easier to use i cant wait till i get the g way better phone than s dont care for samsung phones anyways,1
good beautiful screen bad samsung android dont move your apps to external sd card after a random reboot theyll disappear oversensetive screen no air printing must have plugins if you have an iphone youd better stay with iphone,3
phone overheated just by being on took  min after turning on yo connect to service battery lasted about  min or  hour while not using it and hardly ever had signle but when i switched sim cards to my old phone it worked fine,1
although this phone was advertised as unlocked it was actually locked due to incomplete payment for the phone according to atts website when i entered the phones imei i will be sending it back for a refund,1
i bought this phone when i opened package i found a new phone sticker on screen when i peeled sticker off the screen was badly cracked and at phones screen would not turn on im very disappointed please check equipment before you sell it its good business ethics,1
even though its an older version it still works and feels like new it does not have any flaws or lags of any kind so it doesnt really makes me want to buy a newer version unlike apple i am a samsung customer for life,5
like this cell a lot battery is not as good as my last one this is a good upgrade from working with a s i hope to get the unlock key soon as to at and t has just to much junk added to their cells for my liking,5
was supposed to be an att unlocked phone it was a locked tmobile phone after going to att then tmobile now i have to wait  to  hours to unlock now wont unlock because i am not a t mobil customer sent back which had to pay ,1
this is not an att phone after many frustrating hrs trying to see of i can get this phone to work with att we were able to conclude that not onlybia it not an att phone but its not compatible either pretty upsetting,1
phone came in immaculate condition not a single scratch or ding had no problems activating it shipping time was awesome it came sooner than expected it was packaged well and came with a turbo charger and cable i have no complaints,5
will not data connect to att network i ordered an att phone specifically and this is a sprint phone went to the att store and they were not able to fix it can only call and text unless hooked to wifi will be returning this phone,1
just upgraded from an s to this s first time i have ever purchased a refurbished phone order arrived on time device so far has worked great no problems at all had the lines transferred over with no problems i would definitely purchase from this seller again,5
the ease of use  memory capacity were great the audio was sub par  caused me to return it twice the battery life was laughable i think my issues were due to refurbishment  not the original manufacture,3
not product it said it was i purchased an att unlocked phone i got a verizon phone the edges were all beat up and it appeared to have glue residue on it i dont know about battery life of fingerprint reader as couldnt test those things,1
bought it reconditioned did not come with instructions and had to purchase it separately it has been very dependable with a few quirks but otherwise serves the purpose the reduced price made it much better,4
listed as an att phone this is a sprint phone loaded with standard sprint apps problems linger with group texts voicemail etc works on the att network but it is not an att phone from the listing this device is being sold exclusively for use with att,2
purchased used galaxy s in excellent condition no problems galaxy s is an excellent phone just dont let it get wet it has no protection from water infiltration keep it in a good case for drop protection,5
this phone is great its definitely worth the money it came two days after i ordered it without prime its sleek and has a great screen and quality i would definitely recommend ordering a case for it though overall its a great purchase,5
this is the best phone ive had yet ive gone through a used samsung galaxy s to a j emerge to this phone i love it very much only complaint i have is that i had to buy an old sum card on amazon that boost no longer sells in their kits,5
i ordered my samsung  from the seller legend wireless i paid for a gold s and received a black s and it was also delivered late and it was a usedrefurbished phone and its damaged at the top talk about a bad deal,1
difficult to trust any cell phone purchase on amazon two consectutive new s phones in a row had to be returned neither was actually new and both had major issues i was not the first or only person to experience this as i read the other comments,1
works fine but the screen was burned when it arrived the previous owner clearly did a lot of driving because their navigation app is permanently imprinted on it its not unusable but replacing the screen would cost more than i payed for the device,2
absolutely garbage phone this was supposed to be a brand new phone but the battery life is just horrible it will show  battery life and next thing you know is your phone died do not buy this phone from amazon feel this is refurbished,1
the product came as described and delivery was quick the seller was very helpful in communicating with me via email as i was a bit nervous buying a phone online ive had it now for a month now and everything works great,5
imei was not fully paid off i went to verizon and they told me that the imei was not paid off this means that they sell stolen phones i repeat do not buy these phones they have a good chance of being previously stolen,1
phone was cheapbut i guess thats the danger bought this s from solar tech llc check out the home button there is a gashmajor chipping all around it which is much more wear and tear than they advertise returning now hoping for a better one,2
it all works well except i tried several times to update it and it keep an telling me to needs updated after ive turned it off and on already otherwise it was fine for the money i paid i didnt care for the case i bought so much though,3
i am convinced that this phone was not new it over heats immensely and i have only been using  days the back glass also look s as tho it has been opened and was not replaced properly i even received my package without the earbuds,1
 star phone is in surprisingly good condition product exceeded expectations at first the battery seemed to get to hot but that seemed to be remedied after a software upgrade will continue to monitor but so far a,5
this phone would randomly shut down at  charge left a full charge only last about an hour this started about  months after my purchase the return window has past stuck with an expensive peice of trash,1
its barely five months old it quit working took it to a repair shop and they said the motherboard was bad cant believe a brand new phone went bad that fast thinking somebody sold us a refurbished phone for new,2
 months old and battery swelled up forcing the back off not waterproof when that happens samsung is finally honoring warranty they should stick to tvs my ss washing machine needed recall repairs bought extended warranty for the frig,1
it appears that my battery does not last all day it was charged at  this morning and its only  am and im down to  and yesterday was the first day i used it and i had to charge it what can i do,1
screen smashed in  weeks total failure in a month very very poor design check the reviews on google first everyone has broken their phones right off the bat i will not buy another samsung phone ever,5
i received the gold s three days ago and i am  satisfied i noticed on a previous review someone had an issue with head phone capability regular head phones do work with my phone i have not had any complications great phone i am very pleased,4
i purchased used for my wife the phone was abut dirty and didnt come with original packaging but works great the hardware and weatherproofing put iphone to shame the strogest aspect to this phone is the price and the power and functionality,4
well the phone works fine dont know if it was brand new sealed but might have been a demo or something but no big deal waited for a long time before review to make sure had no issues with the phone thanks,5
i upgraded to the s from the s and am finding it great so far it looks really nice and i like the wallpaper theme i found on the phone ive had several samsung galaxy sx phone so far and liked them all,5
exactly how it was described brand new with casing headphones and charger unlocked i simply inserted my sim card and it has been working great the price for it was fair and saved from getting into a phone contract thanks,5
this phone was a complete rip off it does not have a  megapixel camera it has a mp camera the phone is very small and very cheap u can get a similar phone for alot less dont waste ur money i am returning,1
i like this phone not to big and not to small i have cricket and this works great i added a memory card and all is well price is great too its not a five or six hundred dollar phone but it works just fine,4
when i first ordered the phone i didnt like it i was going to send it backwell i am so happy that i kept the phonemy phone that i had been using just stopped so i remembered that i had the this phone  that i am in love with nowsamsung j great phone,5
this sightly bends when play videos games on it it is made from cheap plastic i dont recommend this phone to cheap feeling and over price also the phone has the worst camera on slow time on apps low screen,1
very good samsung experience all works good lte g etc but no nfc even though all web sites say it has it it dont also no led indicator lights other than that excellent experience it has not miss a bit yet,5
this phone looks good on the site but when you get it it is a small version of the samsung product and it says it can be used with any carrier thats not true failed to meet my expectations will not reccomend or purchase again,2
i knew i was in trouble when the charger that came with the phone wasnt applicable for us electric plug outlets worked two days to try every service provider and guess what no results company sells products from overseas distributions stay away,1
hola buenas tardes en  ocasiones vinieron a recoger el telf pero me encontraba trabajando agradecería si podrían recogerlo después de la  cualquier día de la semana o me indican dirección para yo llevarlo personalmente,1
good evening i received the phone for days all the good however the charger did not work another serious recommendation not to send in such large boxes and that for shipping to another country they are very expensive thank you,3
great phone but some pretty strange corners were cut by samsung  no led light no flash and no flashlight use for this phone  no charging light for  extra they could have done those and most would agree to pay,4
didnt realize this was a european phone so some of the words and settings are different which makes it difficult to navigate not many features and has minimal storage i only use for internet and youtube,4
i have finally begun to use the cell phone it is very good in all areas except the battery life whn it is idle the battery needs to be charged every other day when it is being used the battery runs down in  hours and that is not constant use otherwise very good,4
the set up was not like windows phones of the past i had to select and pin each app myself it did not automatically populate as previous phones when i entered my microsoft id otherwise the phone is great,5
i ordered on line one of these lumia  and recieved it in may this year  and find that the battery life is very poori have to recharge it at least three times a dayand the speaker phone is very low i would not recommend it to any one,1
i didnt buy the mobile and wont buy it as microsoft is about to finish the windows mobile all users will get orphan and wont have support for their cell phones i liked it very much but i dont want to end up with a white elephant in my pocket,1
i love my lumia  and i am really glad to have software on my phone that perfectly ties to my computer its a perfect replacement for the blackberry lovers i do wish it was a little smaller with a slide out keyboard i still miss that feature,5
works fine much better than android or apple unfortunately win  is a substandard version from previous win  os fails to operate as cleanly as the win  still a good phone it is a shame windows failed on the phone market ,4
arrived on time nice looking you get what you pay for i like the phone did not work with republic wireless only a particular j model works on republic mine did not as far as i can tell you cant know the model  you will receive,3
phone works well and is what i expected overall however under the description in the listing it states it has an gb rom but under features and details it states it has a gb rom unfortunately it only has gb which is disappointing,3
im loving this phone so much got  more one for my wife and daughter only issue is the memory dont get this one if you plan on having a lot of apps and games for the price though simple to use and can still have the apps i use daily,4
it was ok for the money i guess had to but another  bucks into it for a battery and chargerswas suppose to come with charger but did not the phone itself was gross very dirty had to give it a good cleaning wish i would have just bought new,2
this phone was purchased to replace my damaged one att no longer has new ones i did not want a refurbished one so i checked amazon and as usual they had anew one and the price was right the phone works perfectly,5
seller sent wrong phone at first was very easy to work with sent the right phone out very fast great communication too cell phone is great cosmetically it takes great pictures good graphics only problem is they get a line down the screen as a defect,4
i had bought the phone to use as a daily but it is already giving problems phone is randomly restarting and then showing  or less of battery i cant make phone calls or texts but the sim card works in other phones,1
i would have given  stars but the product was listed as new and it was definitely not new as there was no box or book the corner has a little chip in it and the home button is scratched up overall the phone is in good condition and works great,4
the phone seemed repackaged and when i made calls it was hard for people to hear on the receiving end the touch screen also stops working often and i couldnt open apps and text because the phone wouldnt recognize my selection when i touch it,1
i bought this phone for my granddaughters th birthday on july  she loved it but it has only been  months and the phone doesnt work anymore screen is black and wont do anything we are very disappointed,1
unfortunatly i had an issue with the phone so i contacted samsung they check the serial number and found out that this was a  years old used phone and so the  year warranty is void thank you in not saying that you are selling used phones,1
im very dissappointed of this product because it was supposed to be unlocked the description says it was unlocked but it is not i will return it and get my money back also when is charging gets superhot and work slow,2
do not buy from legend wireless received a phone that was advertised as new but was used and no longer under warranty due to unauthorized repairs impossible for a new phone to have an unauthorized repair,1
ive only had the phone for  hours but am so happy so far the description said some wear and tear but it looks brand new activating it was a breeze and the guy at att said i got a great deal highly recommended,5
not entirely sold on the wrap around screen but it is a solid phone that works very well battery life is borderline amazing not at all regretful of my choice to get this phone instead of the newer galaxy s,5
i just ordered this and it seems to work great and super fast i really like it i went from a note edge which i was in love with to this one although its not as wide as the edge it feels nice and has a great battery life i will update in a couple days,5
very fast phone i am really impressed with the screen resolution photos are very clear i will buy the ipad pro and see which have better quality i am not a they guru so i just will judge by my eye i hope this phone last at least  years for that price,4
great phone ive had it for a little over  months and have had no issues with it i bought it like new from sikksound and it looked brand new i will definitely buy from them in the future when i decide to upgrade to another samsung,5
great phone just popped in the sim from my wifes broken iphone  and was good to go my s card didnt fit but it came with a sim card that i activated easily on atts website phones arrived earlier than expected and the seller responded back to my questions quickly,5
as advertised fast delivery packaging was appropriate no problems with setup fast charging working well transfer of data not fully successful using samsung or att apps att sim card and number transfer was seamless at the walkin location,5
screen started flickering uncontrollably on the  month one month after warranty always had a sturdy case not dropped no water damage it went just like that and useless now i dont think this is a coincidence would never buy samsung again,1
i have always had sumsung galaxy phones this is a good phone with good processing power great cameras and love the return of the sd card and i bought mine as the s was launching so bought at  the price of the newest i refuse to pay more than  for a phone,5
this did not utilize carrier aggregation nor did it have an official rom my carrier would not support me to even configure the apn on this phone it was garbage do not get these unless you get them from a carrier,3
love this phone specially for only  it said it was used or refurbished i dont remember but it came in a brand new box with a sim card key and i through my tmobile card in and it works perfectly no problems at all im writing the review on this phone right now,5
i was told not to trust buying phones online at my local tmobile store i still purchased this phone as a replacement for an older galaxy and it works great i just had to go to tmobile to buy a new sim card because it didnt come with one,5
i was a little skeptical at first because it had no reviews but i decided to go for it and never looked back the phone is in excellent condition ive had it for over  months and have had  problems with it great buy,5
everything was fine until phone was sent in for repair found out directly from samsung that parts are not original s parts and modifications were made imei did not match color didnt match and model listed on the box didnt match model being sold,1
the phone is a great phone ive had mine since day one ordered this one for my girlfriend and it keeps restarting on its own and keeps saying update needed even after it did it like  times phone condition was pretty good for being old,1
the phone is a great phone however this one specifically has bad reception my old phone i could get service nearly anywhere this one i dont even get phone calls in my own house other than that the phone has been great,3
battery lasted  year and  months enough time so you cannot use the guarantee as usual i will not buy a refurbished device on amazon again and i definitely do not recommend to do so i am terrible disappointed with this purchase,1
i have to carry  phones im on call and my work provides an iphone and i still like the home button this s is the last of the androids that have a home button i also like that i can add microsd memory,5
i bought two phones because the good reviews but one of them has screen problems and it dose not work i am waiting for the refund for one of the phones i hope that the second one keep working,1
i would actually buy  more from this dealer but none have been available almost like new one scratch on the home button the s is amazing was about to give up on samsung after the s was released this phone definitely brought me back around,5
everything i own is either secondhand or obsoleteyear so i paid less than  for this thing despite it being nib condition still using it to this day probably gonna end up getting the s as a replacement during the ss release year,5
love this phone exactly what i wanted no problems and came quickly my son bought one but it didnt work sent it back had got one from the cellular company we use s was available but this one had all the features we wanted,5
great phone the battery life is amazing even tho it was used the screen was perfect shape just a few small dings on the edge but not noticible once you put it in a case awesome performance and its basically a brandnew phone for  bucks,5
i liked me galaxy  the best that by far was the clearest toughest no problem phone ive ever owned my galaxy  has terrible reception and my friends and family complain of echoeing and crackling miss my ,3
i loved it it came with a set of samsung head phones and charger with a dock it shipped rather fast and showed up faster than expected a great place to buy a replacement phone phone functionality is working as intended with no noticeable issues,5
just received the phone everything appears to be working fine and in good condition i gave this  starts because the after market charger went in the trash along with the rusty usb cable for the record i have never seen a rusted usb cable connector until today,3
for an item that is a refurbish it looks great it looks new wow i wouldnt of even know that it was a refurbished phone just by looking at it very beautiful cell phone very classy sophisticated and very chic ,5
this is a great phone for the money only gave it a  star because of poor customer service and poor software personalization somehow the mike level was too low and unable to adjust had to wipe the phone and start from scratch otherwise its a great phone,4
be aware to buy this phone dont buy if you live in a warm place this phone runs very hot always and this model have issues with the screen with stains yellow that appear suddenly read the foros,1
i love this phone quality is great had note  huawei made  and i like this camera ultra more took it to work and everyone wanted to know what it was i got the like new and it was like a new phone  stars,5
every is ok about this cellphone arrives on time and the funtionability is excelent the batery is not ok at all but it is not a problem about the purchase is about sony only mah is a small mah baterry for a big and fast cellphone,5
i owned an xperia several years back and loved it i thought id love the xa ultra theres just not enough storage space im always getting notifications to make space other than that the camera is nice and i like how thin and sleek looking this phone is,4
overall its an ideal phone for its price camera is nice runs nicely my only warning is that this phone is big and heavy i knew that it was going to be big but i really didnt prepare to handle a phone this large feels like a mini tablet to be honest,4
i bought it as a secondary smartphone my main one is iphone se it is the same size as iphone  plus but its display is bigger in size it is handy and useful for browsing micro sd cards battery duration and camera quality with no flash are also good for me,5
even better than i thought theres a neat feature to minimize the screen for one hand usage screen and camera quality is great just wish it had gb with nougat and a few tweaks to settings battery life is decent,4
every time you change change the sim it restart  it keep loosing wifi connection and would not connect until restart gui is ugly job customer service is useless by all means do not waste your money on this st,1
i wanted a larger phone and have used a blu phone for a couple years this phone is amazingly fast im still trying to figure out how to work everything out but it is beautiful maybe a little too big for me but im truly satisfied the camera is pretty okay as well,5
the whole reason i got an unlockphone is to avoid the carriers bloatware this one is sony bloatware i cant even uninstall spotify the phone is great and the camera too but being force to have installed apps that i do not want is a big disappointment,1
its a good phone all around one thing is that if you buy the phone for gaming its not that good but if you just use it for small work and social network it will be perfect ive had it for a while now and its amazing,4
great phone had it for a month now space is an issue tho so you will need an sd card but other than that great quality did not disappoint camera is as fantastic as they say also order with a case to prevent scratches on the back and sides,5
for the price you cant beat it good camera good crisp processor only negative is it needs an sd card due to the internal storage being so limited but thats an extra  bucks i recommend buying this phone and additional sd card with it,5
good product slightly large in size for a small palm accessory is simple only a charger included it took several days to be prepared for shipment but superisingly got it by taking only one day after the shipment,4
exactly the phone i was looking for i guess its the best phone in this price range only things that normal abt this phone is its huge screen size i smtimes get tired of holding this phone other than that i m happy with it,5
my snapchats are crystal clear with nice zoom focus has wide vertical lens capturing a lot in one frame phones overall performance is smooth and fast phone is large but overall is the perfect size for cargo pant pockets,5
when i first got it it had bluetooth issues and still does from time to time the touch screen fails at least ten times a day sometimes it wont register and other times it presses random buttons repeatedly on its own,1
while sony skimped on the battery in lieu of more apps that most people dont need i still love this phone i love the size style etc lost the first one and had to replace it with an exact duplicate it grows on you,4
good phone for the price the battery isnt stellar but if you buy a qualcomm  charger that will charge the phone quickly its not much of an issue the phone feels great in both hands not overly bulky either,5
almost perfectfor mefast processing great reception almost anywhere fantastic display but camera way too slow for mereallyi like it to be instantlike my older xperia zl with its original osit was super fast,5
the sim card read was broken had to send it back so i bought one at best buy instead of waiting for a new shipment it is cheaper hear the phone itself is better then my wife galaxy the camera is worth the money alone,3
high quality has a heavier feel like something made with quality products doesnt get warm at all camera needs to be tried with different settings i leave it manual love the big screen and big keyboard,5
this is a awesome phone its very nice looking and its not to big im using straighttalk att and it runs on lte great and with the android  update it performs awesome coming from a iphone s this is much better,5
not enough room and no wifi calling camera isnt that great either but the way i see it its still better then buying a  dollar phone that is going the crap out after  nonths wont be doing it again just because of wifi calling thought,3
sony xperia xa ultra uno de los peores teléfonos en el mercado tiene graves problemas con el firmware que sony no puede solucionar de manera competente todo un desastre a salvar la cámara el resto a la basura no lo compres,1
good phone works well its a lot faster then my old zs and the camera picks up more low light then samsung galaxy s im running my off tmobile network and there are some things lacking since tmobile doesnt like sony phones since the z model,4
great phone feels good in the hand looks good brilliant display great and fast camera only bad thing is that the fingerprint sensor does not work with the delivered us sw but thats easy fixed by flashing a different version,5
this phone lasted  months before dying from water immersion despite being ip rated and an experienced swimmer the phone also frequently overheated and it was impossible to used several apps namely snapchat if the battery was anything less than ,2
i am very pleased with the unit i was apprehensive when it arrived because their was no box and it was shipped in a plain container i first didnt realized it was my cell phone product was accurately described and i would not have problem ordering it again,5
i thought the phone was great at first i updated it twice the first night ive now been using it for about  weeks and it has done  system updates in two days and its still asking to do another im about ready to smash the damn thing,2
love this phone androids finest camera quality is amazing its so much better than samsung ang more user friendly than apple if you like android phone this is one youll love the screen is so durable but still best to have a case,5
really one piece the trash dont work fine the signal is poor the camera dont work show me the message one time for use your dispositive is more hot now you need re start for work and the gps dont work appropriately,1
i wanted to like this phone it has had some speed issues lately and the constant updates are messing with everything i had to toy around with the developer settings to get my music to work on the bluetooth in my car,3
sony make believe great design doesnt feel hot after normal use battery can support  day normal use hope sony can unlock the fingerprint feature since there is actually a sensor though disabled by sony,5
this phone does not hold a charge and the screen blanks out repeatedly didnt get unbearable until just recently and i am now outside of the return period so now i am stuck with a phone that doesnt for me waste of money bad purchase i do not recommend,1
my first review ever this is a very good looking item however camera overheats so fast that it is worthless  min video and a few pictures is all you get before you get the notification that the camera is overheating,1
its great for taking pictures and videos but if youre a fan of group messaging and receiving pictures from friends dont bother for some reason sony didnt think that their users would like to text their friends in one message sheesh,3
receipt of goods and the purchase is not in conformity with the receipt of the z and i bought the sony x not how to break the promise and has been the second time after sale is not to deal with me very disappointed,1
really surprised about how much bang for the buck sony should advertise this they are missing the boat i use it on tracphone system and it far exceeds my expectations if you doubt me compare xperia specs to high end others and you will see what i mean,5
phone camed in a great package and on time and i was lucky that i got a great deal last month on nov and lol im writing the review now well i took time to write this to help others because i know i how it feels whenever u shop online anyways peace,5
phone arrived with a number of damages a crack in the screen the top right corner damaged and separating from the body and dents and scrapes on all corners completely unacceptable refurbished condition,1
work fantastic i havent had any issues with it since i received it yes its refurbished but ive had a few little scratches on the back but besides that the phone works fantastic and one little scratch on the screen but havent had any issues,5
great phone upgraded from a galaxy s active i work as a building maintenance mechanic i put that thing through hell and it kept on working so i bought the s active when it was time to upgrade definitely buy this if your rough on phones,5
i am disappointed in the battery life started out well but now has to be charged at least once a day since the battery cant be replaced i expected more from it i like the phone otherwise just wanted to go a couple days before i have to recharge,4
love the phone works great but didnt meet what i expect as refurbished screen looks good like new but back and sides of phone have many scratches and dents wish i would have purchased the cheaper one in very good condition,3
item listed as  some minor markings from normal use such as light scratching or scuffs there is no damage no cracks chips or deep scratches on the screen however this item has tons of deeps scratching an scuff damage and deep scratches on the screen,1
i love love this phone but i didnt know how difficult it would be to find a case for it witch it probably dont need but i like to change my phones look alot the shipping was excellent and nothing was damaged,4
so far i like the phone does not have same options as my old phone but does ok as emergency replacement i just need to get used to features probably but easy to use and yes i am momarazzi so i have definitely use camera and it takes pretty good pictures,4
so this came in dark navy blue not even remotely like the teal in the photo this phone is basically a physical representation of your typical tinder date you dont get what you expect but you use it anyways because its there,5
battery life extremely poor cell phone has several incompatibility issues only gets portions of group texts all of this discovered just after the  day return window wish i would have just spent the  on a new moto g play,1
just buy the droid maxx  its only a little bit more then this one at least the ones i looked at this model is a bit old and at times a bit slow switched from an iphone though so im not really complaining,3
i really really like my phone ive had just about every brand of phone available the droid by far has the best battery life there is which is one of the main reasons for purchasing it its a fun phone with great featuresand best of all it was a great price,5
 months after i bought the phone half of the screen became static the phone was working fine except for the display which seems to be a common s problem i did a factory reset but unfortunately that did not help im going to send it to samsung support to fix it,2
ordered this to replace my old phone went to cut it on at verizon to activate battery was  after waiting and charging finally cut on to activate the phone would not stay on at  kept rebooting in a loop,1
do not purchase a total waste of ones money only once it was charged to a  percent  the port for the charger had lots of marks all over around the camera looked weared out please do not waste your money the speaker charger and headphone ports was very dusty,1
this phone has unlocked in the description and as i am now realising that this was click bait im really upset because now i have a phone locked to verizon wireless and will now have to pay for it to be unlocked angry face phone looks fine,3
i think its too bad to send items without a supervision because i think this happened if i know that have any defect i would not have bought it anyway i will continue shopping here because i have always had a good experience with my accessories,2
ordered the wrong product seller stated that previous sim card would work in the unlocked phone however when placed the phone indicated its the wrong carrier sin card anticipating to send phone back and have monies refunded,1
i thought i was buying a real verizon samsung galaxy  no this was not verizon stated this was a fake phone it dont have none of the settings a verizon face time at all video quality is awful i called left message to the tech they gave me never called me back,1
had to replace my sons samsung s it started having issues after him having a while this was a great deal so i got it for him he is very pleased with it  says lots of definite better upgrades from his samsung s he is very pleased with it works great,5
same as another reviewer this is a smgu it will not work on red pocket and likely other verizon mvnos until you flash it to be a gv  youll have calls but no texts or data once its flashed with the verizon firmware everything will work properly,3
phone in excellent condition  stars because i ordered gv expecting cdma and got gu gsm came charged  dropped to s after a few minutes beautiful screen everything worked that was supposed to have to send back,4
bought it used and they claim a guarantee battery life of  not even close it drains  in a couple hours and i dont even use it and no theres no apps running in the background and the backlight is set to low,1
galaxy  wasnt really that great id expected better performance in areas of reception battery needs to be charged every  hours or less i would love to trade this phone in for a better android phone thanks,2
just about six months after having bought this cell phone which is really good normally it appeared a problem with the imei and i am not being able to solve it not sure if the seller is going to recognize this problem,1
my phone software crashed after working for a few months possibly after a software update tmobile couldnt do anything with itso i had to buy a new phone on the spot from tmobile because i need it for work,1
got the phone and it was stolen tmobile put a lock on it and said its jail broken and not even a real tmobile phone also bank information was stolen from phone as well do not buy from this person its a scam also i filed an a to z claim,1
the phone works well so far i havent checked if i can have g on it yet since i have only been using wifi the charger they provided suuuucked it stopped charging within one day literally also the phone was slightly more used in appearance than i was expecting,4
phone started out great but started to crap out on me after a couple of months ie the usb charge port stopped working then i stared having software issues had to go beyond the seller up through amazon customer service to get the issue handled,2
the phone itself is great  shipping was fast  however the images used showed a wireless charger  that was not included  so that was disappointing  also it did not include the needed sim card tool to open the tray  so  stars overall,3
i have always had sumsung galaxy phones this is a good phone with good processing power great cameras and love the return of the sd card and i bought mine as the s was launching so bought at  the price of the newest i refuse to pay more than  for a phone,5
this did not utilize carrier aggregation nor did it have an official rom my carrier would not support me to even configure the apn on this phone it was garbage do not get these unless you get them from a carrier,3
love this phone specially for only  it said it was used or refurbished i dont remember but it came in a brand new box with a sim card key and i through my tmobile card in and it works perfectly no problems at all im writing the review on this phone right now,5
i was told not to trust buying phones online at my local tmobile store i still purchased this phone as a replacement for an older galaxy and it works great i just had to go to tmobile to buy a new sim card because it didnt come with one,5
i was a little skeptical at first because it had no reviews but i decided to go for it and never looked back the phone is in excellent condition ive had it for over  months and have had  problems with it great buy,5
everything was fine until phone was sent in for repair found out directly from samsung that parts are not original s parts and modifications were made imei did not match color didnt match and model listed on the box didnt match model being sold,1
the phone is a great phone ive had mine since day one ordered this one for my girlfriend and it keeps restarting on its own and keeps saying update needed even after it did it like  times phone condition was pretty good for being old,1
the phone is a great phone however this one specifically has bad reception my old phone i could get service nearly anywhere this one i dont even get phone calls in my own house other than that the phone has been great,3
battery lasted  year and  months enough time so you cannot use the guarantee as usual i will not buy a refurbished device on amazon again and i definitely do not recommend to do so i am terrible disappointed with this purchase,1
i have to carry  phones im on call and my work provides an iphone and i still like the home button this s is the last of the androids that have a home button i also like that i can add microsd memory,5
i bought two phones because the good reviews but one of them has screen problems and it dose not work i am waiting for the refund for one of the phones i hope that the second one keep working,1
i would actually buy  more from this dealer but none have been available almost like new one scratch on the home button the s is amazing was about to give up on samsung after the s was released this phone definitely brought me back around,5
everything i own is either secondhand or obsoleteyear so i paid less than  for this thing despite it being nib condition still using it to this day probably gonna end up getting the s as a replacement during the ss release year,5
love this phone exactly what i wanted no problems and came quickly my son bought one but it didnt work sent it back had got one from the cellular company we use s was available but this one had all the features we wanted,5
great phone the battery life is amazing even tho it was used the screen was perfect shape just a few small dings on the edge but not noticible once you put it in a case awesome performance and its basically a brandnew phone for  bucks,5
i liked me galaxy  the best that by far was the clearest toughest no problem phone ive ever owned my galaxy  has terrible reception and my friends and family complain of echoeing and crackling miss my ,3
i loved it it came with a set of samsung head phones and charger with a dock it shipped rather fast and showed up faster than expected a great place to buy a replacement phone phone functionality is working as intended with no noticeable issues,5
just received the phone everything appears to be working fine and in good condition i gave this  starts because the after market charger went in the trash along with the rusty usb cable for the record i have never seen a rusted usb cable connector until today,3
for an item that is a refurbish it looks great it looks new wow i wouldnt of even know that it was a refurbished phone just by looking at it very beautiful cell phone very classy sophisticated and very chic ,5
bought two one for my girlfriend and one for me both phones were in perfect conditions they actually looked new had zero issues setting them up or getting them to connect thru tmobiles network ive had the phone two weeks now and ive had no problems whatsoever,5
beware of vip outlet they do not pick up phone calls or answer emails their phone dont work and the display looks like a fake replacement part causing it to not register to tap also the included charger is a knockoff  nongenuine copy,1
the phone came in great quality  but when i got my sims  went to my carrier they said my signal chip in the phone is broken  so im pissed  want a new phone or my money back because everything should work when you purchase an item,3
unless told it is a brand new phone out of the package i am so happy to have it for my wife on valentines daytwo days passed and she has been using it without a single frawn thanks amazon for their excellent logistics and breed to have the product ready for her,5
the phone came in excellent condition i cant believe is not brand new because it definitely looks and feel like it battery life and performance far beyond expectations excellent buy i would buy from the again anytime  i am extremely happy with the phone,5
this item is  real i got mine yesterday and its perfectly ok just like newwhen i input my sim card here in nigeria it works ok i dont know why this item is having negative viewto me its jes too okay for the price just like new,5
just got it today has a minor scratch on the side but the phone functions perfectly this doesnt come with a screen protector or anything but the packaging was very secure i would recommend this phone had no problem with activating it through metro pcs,5
phone was beautiful when it arrived and appeared to be brand new however the phone would not charge and when taken to verizon to activate the phone would continuously turn off without warning not happy,1
nice phone just received and looks brand new not a single mark worth to the price im yet to use it but feels good to see the phone starts nice no one can find its refurbished until you tell im happy with the purchase,4
the iphone was immaculate no scuffs and truly gsm unlocked although i was skeptical at first from reading everyones reviews i took a chance the seller i purchased the phone from was chubbiestech and they definitely delivered,5
 months ago i that got the device it came in perfect shape brand new no scratches pure quality i loved it  have dropped it twice and still working like a champ highly recommended from chubbiestech ,5
in the publication says iphone s plus  gb and the package was an iphone s plus  gb the seller responds that it was for  gb but im not agree because the ad says something different  the phone arrives ok  perfect conditions,1
i gave a  star rating because it is an iphone however the touch calibration goes out a lot and callers at time cant hear you talking also will not send pictures to other smartphone users only those with iphones,3
this phone was great until i went to get it cut on and they said it wouldnt support my carrier when in the description it clearly said it was unlocked now i have to return it and struggle to find another phone ,5
worst phone i have had in  years do not bother buying this phone refurbished battery lasts just a few hours the headphone jack does not work and it takes forever for the bluetooth to connect to a phone,1
love the phone came fast and perfect condition have no issues at all im using it for everything even writing this review came without being locked or needing to jail break it easy set up and problems yet ive had it about  months,5
well that did not take long  month for the first drop  month before the screen shattered i was under the impression that the gorilla glass was supposed to be able to take a fall either way it is a good phone i am going to purchase another one with a case,4
this is a really great phone with just one minor inconvenient the dialer interface doesnt let you see the phone numbers of recent calls you have to go to each record to see the number also there is no templates for sms,5
garbage refurbished is supposed to be to factory new specs i was replacing this phone due to the poor battery performance on my old droid turbo this one is even worse warning do not buy a refurbished phone,1
the phone back cover was flimsy where you can tell that it was previously open for repair besides that i like motorola droid turbo as an android option its fast reliable and highly featured in comparison to other phones at the same level,4
the phone that came was red not black i needed a phone so i was going to settle for the red one until i turned it on and the screen froze it then turned itself off and on every couple of minutes until the battery died,1
its a very nice phone but the battery cant be replaced and it only lasts  hours on a full charge depending on if its being used ive asked for a replacement so hopefully the seller will provide one with a battery that lasts much longer,3
i did not receive a factory unlocked phone i received an att branded phone full of att junkware phone was not new and was not in a sealed box it remains to be seen whether i can remove the att junk and make this a generic unlocked phone,1
barely  months with the phone and it slowly started spotting from the inside with purple blotches i have not dropped my phone once im pretty sure this was a refurbished phone and it was not disclosed on the description of the item,1
phone is not unlocked save yourself some time and look somewhere else for an unlocked phone my sim card locked all of a sudden and i was unable to use my phone for a week until it was unlocked from att phone was also faulty,1
very durable great for my work phone i cant have a camera phone at work the camera on this was easy for me to pop out and fill with jb weld good sound quality texting takes a little getting used to but overall great phone for the price,5
liked the fact the the text was easy to read but when speaking with others on the phone was told it was very difficult to understand me they describe it as an echo type sound and im not sure if that can be corrected,1
verizon will not activate this phone because its g cant find any carrier that will activate this phone seller online shopping wont allow return because  days past  day return window its a useless phone with deceptive advertising,1
piece of junk the phone kept cutting in and out and would randomly just shut off i was told amazon usually only has reconditioned phones but i bought it anyway because i have in the past and have always been happy with my purchases,1
i just got it switched over yesterday i liked it but it shuts off at random times  sometimes takes  or  tries to get it back on it might shut off  times in  minutes and then wont do it for hours very frustrating looks like ill be looking for a new phone,2
this was bought as new and it has a defect callers cant hear husband and they cant hear him this was bought for fathers day not happy the return option was closed the day it arrived two days after i ordered it,1
excellent phone very fast the battery life is very good for the use i give to the phone it last more than a day the only complaint is that the notifications sounds is very low and lenovo didnt fix it yet,5
waning batter after  months is ridiculous buyer beware this is my last motorola purchase there are other products available with manufacturers that stand by them i wish i could give this a negative rating which is what it deserves,1
super thin and light great screen photos have come out good when indoors ton of memory for my needs android upgraded as soon as i had it running no need to spend  or  times mores for a  or x if you just want a good phone cant wait to get the projector mod,5
camera issue right out of the box called tech support and was told warranty is expired after i had it two weeks what how is that right i have had motorola for years and this is the worst one i have ever had seriously thinking another brand now,1
phone is  months old battery does not hold a charge unless in plugged to electrical outlet volume buttons stooped working motorola wont replace phone because they claimed that i did not purchase the phone directly from their store really bad customer care,1
do not waste your money on this phone i have had two since my first one was replaced under warranty by motorola for a defective battery the second one is no better the battery will drain really fast for no reason and will turn itself off randomly,1
this phone started having issues after about  months charger worked intermittently and bluetooth stopped working finally it died completely contacted motorola and was told the phone is not under warranty contacted the seller and they never replied,1
phone restarts continuously and as seller advertised product doesnt have us warranty which manufacturer motorolla confirmed and denied replacement  service in us am left with loosing money on this,1
bought two in a year since i broke the first one and the charger cable is not compatible with each other contacted them via support no reply i would have give it  if i get a courtesy reply i will consider another brand for my next smartphone,2
i got one had to return because the screen came all crazy filled of colors the second one i got after  months is with problem on the audio i cant listen to people really well and even notification sounds are bad probably it uses the same sound internal box,1
i thought i had verified that the unit was compatible with verizons us system well according to verizon this phone cannot be used in the united stateshaving a hard time contacting seller for refund or exchange if you are in the us  stay away,1
im not sure why one would go from the mp camera with the moto pure x to this mp limited offering cmon moto also the dual sim still no go this phone for more money is a downgrade from the moto pure x,2
this seller isnt giving a full year warranty they only have warranty for  months which is unacceptable wtf is this if it doesnt have warranty is must be advertised and its price should be decreased for that not recommended dont buy it,1
 months into ownership phone starts to shut down randomly battery charge lasts around  to  minutes and shut down when theres still  power left motorolas warranty is  months long and battery warranty is  months long if you read the fine prints,2
one of the best android ever made the battery for a mah is excellent getting  to hr ost the camera is spectacular there is zero lag in this phone compare to the bloated skins phones from korea here is a few photos i took with this phone ,5
good phone but there are wifi and bluetooth issues and their connectivity i bought an open box for  so with those issues every now and then its a good phone at that price but i wouldnt pay full msrp especially with better alternatives from sony,3
phone unusable after a year of owning it battery drains to half about  minutes after unplugging from charger  at which point it crashes dead terrible purchase battery is not covered under warranty avoid this phone,1
the phone itself is amazing super fast thin and modular accessories make it the best phone it is severely underrated i wish motorola had better support for it though and the software could use a few features like glove mode otherwise it is an absolute beast,5
great cell reception no matter where i was sadly this phone is only as good as the pricey mods you can attach to it  lasted about a year before it got stuck in the constant boot loop and i had to get it replaced,3
built in battery too small addon batter too large needs a goldy locks battery  needs a separate charger for external batteries was a mild pain to twrp to upgrade to stock nougat and android pay  capital one pay both crash,4
i like it got the battery mod which takes away from the super slimness but i dont like running out of juice the flashlight does not turn on with two chops i wish that function worked dont know if its a defect so am pondering returning it,5
i initially had a  star review however since the android  update nothing but issues the most glaring is the bluetooth wifi and nfc connectivity there is not connectivity comes in and out very frustrating since motorola is of no help,1
when i bought cellphone in warehouse deal it shows pristine package package was opened charger was used and phone has a scratch as a kneaded it is like it dropped down once i am disappointed because already buy a lot here and never saw this kind of thing,2
i bought this item with a lot of good expectation but so disappointed when various times i could not turn it onalso i charged it one night with the power off the following morning the phone was not charged,1
i hate this phone total junk do not buy unless you want a phone that cannot get the new update and has ads that intrude every  minutes even over navigation when im driving im returning this nightmare and going back to iphone,1
i am really disappointed its not turning on no one is ready to help me here i tried everywhen sony support they says this mbl is expired in  we cant help u no local people fix and speaker was not working from the begining i informed to goutham cells too at that time,1
upgraded to the zx from a zs that i have loved for years love the design fits perfect in my hand amazing quality of photos and videos have loved sony phones as theyre a great company to resolve any product issues or concerns unlike their competitors,5
funciona de maravilla es rápido y toma muy buenas fotos con buena iluminación tiene  mp lo que permite distinguir los objetos desde casi  metros de distancia es como si el ojo humano hubiera tomado la foto,5
changing from the xperia xa ultra its a bit smaller and the sound not as loud and crisp for music but the processing is good the camera holds up will update as time progresses but right now loving the phone as it is,4
great phone i upgraded from a galaxy note  which i loved but unfortunately lost i must say that the sony takes much more advantage of the processor and the gb of ram than the note and thats saying a lot,5
super performance and design extraordinary frontal camera main camera is very nice too if used with manual settings lots of memory modern symmetric usb connector convenient fingerprint scanner my best phone so far,5
sharp phone great processing power and no one else has it i went with att with unlimited everything fyi for audio lovers this phone supports flac and hi res dsd files downside the battery should be bigger,5
i thougt i has making a good investing with these cell phone but is defective the battery never work properly and now it only work  hours a day the photos are not the best it doesnt worth the price i pay and i feel scammed,1
dont buy sent it to sony xperia repair center and it has been  days still didnt get the phone sony if you sell a phone and are not behind it then it absolutely useless if you want to save xpeira provide customer service like apple,1
doing what i expected and more excellent phone clear calls stunning pics and i have been doing a lot of video conf with fantastic results still pending to check high res audio the speakers are coming soon but so far the best xperia phone ever,5
screen was replaces and a red spot is on the screen at all times battery doesnt last more than  day i understand that it is not a new cellphone but the description doesnt meet the quality of the device i received,3
the phone its working just fine only issue is that it discharges kind of fast but for the rest its pretty good i do miss the more metallic look of previous xperia like the z i owned the back of the phone had scratched slightly after putting in pocket,4
wanted to love this phoneand did for a while without damage the touchscreen died in the middle started making rapid random swipe motions couldnt deal goodbye f photo from free drawing test in service mode,2
great phone im happy with this one over the x performance the only thing is i only get g on tmobile but i love this device this is the one flagship that allow you to put your app on the sd card big update,4
i bought this device about  months and these last days it started with constant disconnections from the network and wifi sources its a pity as this is my second xz but the first one had warranty look for the proper warranty before you buy any cellphone,1
so far after  days this phone makes me a believer in google phones i will never go back to samsung or lg phones i have also signed on to google fi project and receive  bars of service where verizon only gave me  highly recommend fi,5
like everything except the fact google is going to stop updating pixel next october not the sellers fault but should be disclosed in the description i would have bought the pixel  xl instead now i have an expensive phone only good for one year,4
this phone has been great i bought it as an upgrade from my old nexus  after a fatal drop it arrived charged and ready to use and i was able to make calls as soon as i swapped my sim card the camera is excellent and im very happy with the latest android os,5
a smartphone has all its smarts in the sim card without it the phone is deaf dumb blind and stupid also frustrating because google wont deal with its customers on the phone internet commerce is a an exercise in futility,1
ordered this phone because it was the most bang for the buck first one was lost second one was in dutch returned that third one also in dutch thankfully figured out a work around but still a pain to have to switch languages constantly,1
phone is quick battery is good and there is tons kf storage i upgraded from a note  and i am  happy i miss the precision of the spen for writing on pictures well mostly screen shots of mapsbut otherwise it has been great camera has been excellent also,5
the phone itself is great however my phone came with  battery and was in not in english which leads me to think this was already opened the battery life is not that great and i have a friend who also has a pixel xl and his battery lasts longer,2
no user manual in box or online by co essential buttons hidden much trouble setting it up couldnt find how to answer a call  great look and feel only buy it if you already know how to use a google i had only used a small older samsung,1
worked ok for a month then had a green vertical line in the middle of the screen only went down hill from there phone is totally out of control and does what it wants this is my second pixel next one will be a samsung pixel xl is a real did,1
i got this phone only  months ago but its already malfunctioning first i couldnt hear any sound when playing music unless i put in earphones but id hear calls now i cant hear any audio unless earphones are in,1
i did not get a pixel xl i received a standard pixel the mic does not work on it i can hear people but they cant hear me i am very unhappy i am awaiting a response about how this is going to be rectified i will update my review then,1
the phone worked great for about a month good pictures good reception then it stopped working i couldnt get it to turn on i went to youtube university to try all the advice there no luck the good news is amazon let me return it with no problems,2
so far so good i have only had it for a week i am happy that it was easy to operate and set up the pictures i have taken so far have excellent quality glad i didnt pay close to a thousand dollars for the newer model this works just fine,5
overall this product is in very good shape until i turned to screen on to find a very severe case of screen burn i am trying to fix it now but this is the nd time ive made an attempt to purchase this phone from amazon but i just keep having problems,2
this new phone died after  months one day when charging it started to make a burning smell and the area around the charging port got very hot thankfully amazon came through and was willing to return the item even though it was after  days,1
all the press lately has gone to the new pixel a but this is still an excellent android device received android pie and all patches immediately when booting up worked flawlessly on tmobile and even when traveling in japan still highly recommended,5
i spent a lot of time trying to find a phone that works with us cellular this one does i really like the slightly larger screen only down part is that it has a different plug than the universal ones on other phones,4
the product arrived impeccably in time taking into account the distance the cell phone without any physical damage as described i had a problem with the accessory but the seller fixed it just by mentioning it totally satisfied,5
i thought the item was new but it was refurbished i may have misread the ad but the phone is working well the charger that came with it broke after about a month of use so  stars due to low quality cable,4
i like this phone the size display and camera is great the only thing i noticed right away is battery life the phone doesnt charge to  and it drains pretty fast so i might return this to see what some better options are battery life is essential to me,4
absolutely love this phone it sleek easy to use and good color i was originally considering getting a samsung galaxy of some sort but i would  recommend getting this over it it has great picture quality as well,5
everything looks very good and exactly as it mentioned in the product specification the battery life might be a problem i need to recharge my phone once a day but i guess thats also normal to a old phone,5
bought a pixel xl n ew from google several years ago loved the phone i bricked it at a pool party bought this phone and its the exact model i purchased from google and its still getting os updates from google,5
have had this a little over a month  as of today im stuck on the unlock screen  sure im putting it in correctly  it just loops back to the unlock screen again after such a short time of use this is unacceptable,1
i bought this when it was priced at  dollars i see its now at  and have no regrets its comparable to the pixel a in specs but has more memory its not a budget phone its a value phone with a headphone jack,5
absolutely love ive had this for a couple months now and my only complaint are those ads that randomly show up oh my phone awesome camera quality and very durable i bought an otterbox for it and i have no issues,5
does anyone else have a problem with the keyboard disappearing after usage for over  minutes well my phone is less than  week old and hasnt seen a scratch will update review after responses thank you for your time,1
everything is kool but the talk back feature is annoying  it randomly starts and you have to use  fingers or else it wont work  its a stupid useless feature and i hope this rating declines your sales  no one needs talk back feature its annoying ,4
i really like this phone great battery and all the latest os updates it gave me a slightly different look than my htc m but after a couple weeks i am very happy perfect screen size for me works great on the tmobile network,5
i already own the original pixel xl so when i saw a used one  gb variant for  i couldnt pass up the deal  even in  it has one of the best cameras  im gifting this one to my wife she uses the iphone  plus but actually prefers the camera on my pixel xl,5
received the phone super quickly the description said minor scratches but the phone arrived seemingly brand new with a tiny scratch at the top that wouldnt have bothered me anyway if it had been new thanks ,5
just bought my google pixel xl  gig from google for  after taxes im not sure why you are hiking the price close to double what my unlocked phone costs from the manufacturer but if someone buys it from you at that crazy price  godbless you,1
perfect price to show how short my phallace is but how much money i could spend on plastic surgery to extend such phallace  bought  of them the pixel xl does not cost  grand it doesnt even cost a grand,5
all previous nexus phonesand all other unlocked phones i have tried had no problem tethering on cricket the pixel dropped this functionality requiring the purchase of a tethering plan double the price and remove old functionality fun,1
i bought one and then decided to buy another the first one was perfect no scratches and looked brand new but the second one had scratches on the screen  not too noticeable when turned on overall i would recommend this product,5
battery was dead when i got it i charged it to full capacity and then unplugged the charger and the battery went down to zero in a few minutes took it to the apple store and they said the battery was defective and charged me  dollars to replace it,3
good phone but dont buy the people who had before locked the phone i cant get service or do anything on here besides wifi which depeats the purpose of buying ill be using this on wifi but wish service could work,2
dont buy from breed seller my phone stopped working just a week or two after their  day warranty ended now im out  i suggest buying directly from google if you want any sort of support or assurance that the phone wont break after  weeks,1
i was nervous buying a used phone online but with the costs of phones these days i figured id try it out product was in perfect condition and was reset i have had it for a year now and unlike i phones it still works as good as the day i got it good job google,5
great arrived in good condition everything works from what i can see only real problem is the battery doesnt hold much of a charge minor problem with these phones its a little tougher to find a screen protector,4
this phone didnt even last a year i was very disappointed the speaker started having issues i couldnt make calls and then it wouldnt let me send texts i bought this phone cause it has a good camera and it does,2
when i purchased the phone the battery life is not good and then when i went to go charge it it did not charge it all it just showed a black screen and the charging symbol but after waiting for two days no charge at all,1
hi i brought this phone and i encountering wifi connection issues it says wifi is connected but no internet i tried everything mentioned in pixel community support but nothing work can you help me on this thanks,2
this product came new in the box i have been a long term iphone user but recently made the switch to this android phone and i am glad i did great phone that takes amazing photos the camera is such good quality product arrived quickly and was as described,5
worked ok for about  months and then crashed unfixable hardware issue also when we received it the charging port wouldnt even fully seat the cable when charging all in all dont buy from them goodbye ,1
bought it for the camera and was not disappointed good battery all the processing ill ever need and the screen has survived many falls on concrete floors without cracking no screen protector love that it still has a headphone jack too,5
it is a nice sleek phone battery does not last as long as i hoped after  days of use i already noticed a light scratch on screen its never been dropped and i never put it in the same pocket with my keys,3
the purchased phone started to reboot constantly at the beginning just  times a day then several times a day nothing helped including several factory resets after  weeks it just bricked no any possibility to turn it on,1
i am extremely happy with this purchase the phone was a pain to get activated on us cellular but thats us cellulars fault not the phones ive had no problems with it so far and for the price i couldnt be happier,5
got this phone for real cheap and it works for the most part the ear piece speaker does not work however so i have to take calls on speaker or use headphones seller was unresponsive regarding this issue,3
good phone compared to all other android phones currently on the market bad phone compared to googles nexus  which is now  years old congratulations google your products are finally starting to regress end of review,3
i love this phone only thing i wished everyone would have not taken away was the micosd expansion thats crucial for pictures and videos to be kept separate from the phone as well as a good place for storing music,5
i only had this phone for one day and then it started overheating it would overheat every time i used it even when i was doing the smallest tasks i restarted it and it did the same thing every single time i used it i returned it because i thought it was defective,2
as long as u buy from a reputable seller youre in a good shape bought mine used for  what a steal had a few scratches on the sides and signs of use but otherwise perfectly functioning phone great battery great performance great brand,5
lol this phone didnt even work the mic and the speaker didnt work took it to a friend who fixes phones said to just send it back i got ripped off the only way the phone would work is if you use a bluetooth head set lol wow,1
when i received this item one of the two speakers was non functional meh whatever i am a headphones guy about  months go by and my phone keeps restarting itself i might have got a dud but i am not impressed,3
battery life seems average for a smart phone i have an otter box on it because smart phones break if dropped on tiles or cement it has been a learning curve but i am really loving not running out of memory,4
this phone was advertised as new with a price reflecting the new price it its not it is missing once of the cables has the wrong sim key included the usb a to c adapter is missing and is missing some packaging this is going back,1
every time i turn this phone on it gives me an orange error message and this phone does not allow group messages and it also does not display any pictures in the text messaging will not purchase from this business again,1
not related to the phone itself but this is the fourth phone ive gotten from amazon several different carriers that said unlocked but were instead locked to amazon this is a bigger deal as updates are ending this year so it limits future upgrade path,1
my phones motherboard died randomly just outside the warranty and google supports service is terrible im writing this review with my iphone  which is working great after continuous use for ish years googles hardware quality is awful,1
this phone has been awesome for me if i didnt already know it was refurbished i would have thought it was brand new great condition the camera is also out of this world and im able to get lots of work done on the go love it,5
best phone ive ever bought especially for this price i have had zero problems for the  months ive been using it the only critique is that its battery life isnt super great but for a  year oldused phone its really great,5
got the phone worked fine for about a month which coincidentally is the length of the warranty and now the screen randomly spasms and misclicks misreads clicks etc it works about half the time which is quite poor for  some dollars,1
this was a replacement phone for a lost one didnt want to pay full price this one was new and unlocked son has had it since february and it works great charger from retailer broke about a month in but we had original charger which works fine great phone and price,5
the phone works great its unlocked my son is using on tmobile however it is a verizon phone with a sim card and all we dont root or flash or do any tinkering of that sort so its fine for us so far,5
was very please with the cell phone initially but within  months the phone would not work properly had to go thru asurion and that was a nightmare my advice if you purchase a refurbished phone make sure to get a warranty but not asurion,3
phone has been fantastic camera is excellent battery life is great it came exactly how it was described possibly even a little better than described price was fair for the age and condition i would buy from this seller again,5
i love my google pixel its not the latest one but i still love this phone i think it is awesome i love that it has the ability to record in stereo out of the box unlike the iphone apple needs to get on that this is an awesome phone,5
my battery lasts  hours its been like this since day one really disappointing that the phone was refurbished and this problem wasnt addressed now i have to go buy a new battery and get it replaced because im constantly tethered to a power bank,1
i was surprised it was in such good condition two scratches on back and none any where else works awesome had it only two days but i am very happy with it all amazon transactions ive been involved in were great i will return more frequently,5
purchased phone because my older one crapped out i figured i would have been good purchasing a certified refurbished phone the phone has really bad burn in from the previous use i see ghost icons while trying to use the phone,2
this seller knew the phone was bad and he still sold it phone turns on and when a call comes in it will freeze not responding not turning off cant do nothing so you have to leave it till the battery runs out,1
this is complete crap i spent  and it lasted for five months today it just quit i just restarted it because my library app sometimes caused it to freeze up it never turned back on its a  paperweight,1
so far i am so happy with this phone i was very apprehensive of ordering a phone off of amazon but the quality is phenomenal you would never guess its refurbished im super hard on phones so im hoping this will last,5
ive had this phone for a year now and i love it the touch of it feels just like an iphone never had any problems this phone came without any bloatware because it is the google version i would buy from this seller again,5
my daughter loves the google pixel xl she is thrilled that it holds a charge as long as it does she can get through a whole day of school without it losing its charge cant think of anything that she doesnt like about it,5
was working great for about a month then suddenly became unusable phone is having a crashing issue when using the phone app a known issue that google refuses to fix i paid for the phone and now it is essentially useless i am beyond disappointed,1
my first nonphone ever so far it is a damn fine phone im getting used to the android os relatively easy the camera takes comparable photos in most conditions but overall the iphone camera beats imho,4
terrific phone super fast with tons of features the best android apps are designed for the likes of pixels os in my opinion a nearly k price tag is ridiculous bought like new for  while thats still very expensive everything about this phone is top notch,5
good deal for noniphone user it enables other services provided by google as allo and project fi the performance is great it will hold more than  applications rather than suspending them the camera is as good as handy digital cameras,5
the good camera excellent no att or samsung junkware apps on it super fast excellent screen the bad battery life maybe  a day android os is  battery usage very disappointing battery life makes it only  hours with clunky mophie on back,3
buyer beware this is a great phone however due to a builtin issue it will stop working if youre lucky it will happen while its still on warranty but even if it gets replaced you will end up with a phone thats not working again,1
this is easily the worst phone i have ever had and i change my phones every two years calls drop does not pick up network very well youtube red works terrible never again i should have just stayed with a samsung even with the chance that it might burst in my face,1
the pixel xl is not the google store version its the verizon version description said factory unlocked phone and did not mentioned verizon version exterior was in very good condition bootloader cannot be unlocked,3
i was a bit hesitant to order as i was burned by another new pixel phone by another seller which wasnt new abes was indeed a new phone great battery works perfectly with additional storage vs my original pixel will order from abes again,5
got a brand new unblemished device from homegoods shop with the official box materials and all cables and chargers device is extremely fast smooth and well built didnt think i would like it as much as i have so far,5
i had a nexus  and then a nexus x im a big fan of google phones so this was the next step for me ive had it for about a month now and im really loving it its slightly smaller than my x and im finding that i actually prefer it that way,5
lives up to all the hype not quite apple iphone build quality or os but very good by the way ive owned and used every nexus device and several lg and htc phones this is the best probably because of the pure android experience and unique pixel os features,5
this is the snappiest smartphone ive ever used and i have used a lot of them in my profession as a mobile app tester if youre thinking about upgrading or switching from iphone you wont be disappointed works with google fi whose wireless service is amazing,5
lives up to all the hype not quite apple iphone build quality or os but very good by the way ive owned and used every nexus device and several lg and htc phones this is the best probably because of the pure android experience and unique pixel os features,5
excellent service and sound quality very fast and responsive stock android is great no annoying overlay like samsung has wont explode in your pocket fingerprint scanner on back is very convenient also,5
me and my gf have a pixel and we both agree there are decent things going on with this phone but its so god damn buggydropping calls random reboots and troubles pairing with other devices my nexus  was also quite buggy wont buy google mobile products again,2
very nice smartphone it takes great pictures which can be easily stored on the cloud the camera feature is the best in my opinion long lasting battery the phone is a bit pricey but is a bargain compared to the very high priced iphone,5
this phone is great for pretty much all your everyday needs the charge is pretty lame wish it stayed charged for more than a couple of hours the picture quality is ok but i have had phones that did better this is a basic phone but does the job,3
this phone is amazing updated instantly to android  nouget can use apps my note  uses but the speakers suck hard its not really a problem for my music because i use my headphones but in the morning i can barely hear my alarm,4
this is another winner from sony brilliant photos with the highest mp cameras intuitive functions make this phone easy to upgrade fastest charging and longest lasting battery and great sony quality for music and video,5
este celular tiene muy buenos atributos pero con exigencia se queda en respuesta se bloquea continuamente el problema especialmente esta en la batería se recalienta y bloquea aplicaciones comunmente la cámara,4
one of the best phones i have owned wash the phone everyday germaphobe and dropped it about more than a few hundred times since i have owned it solid phone still water resistant and working fine,5
fits my needs quite well and without network bloatware the design is an attractive conservative look to me and sticks out from the crowd of over saturation that is the us phone market thank god it isnt a carrier specific phone,5
i love the xz design and it has been performing wonderfully with the android nougat update im definitely satisfied with my purchase and the amazon shopping experience was great definitely get a case for it the metal back is prone to scratches,4
this model f is advertized as lte howeveri had to order three separate f model phones to get one that was g lte compatible first two only works on limited number of gsm frequencies not g lte inspected in person and confirmed by tmobile staff,1
the speakers are really good quality and the screen resolution and camera are top notch only thing on my wish list it didnt have is a fingerprint scanner but that is definitely something i can live without,5
bad phone had problems with the wifi since the first day of use somestimes the phone doesnt recognize the simcard and after the restart the phone continues working well also get very slow while using spotify  waze,1
the have have problems recognizing when your earphones are plugged looking at forums found out that its connected to jack sensitivity better off keep yourself away from sony phones seems like this problem across many models,2
its an awesome mobile phone  start  no problems at all one  less becoz its lil slippery and too smooth to grab or pick it  with out a flip cover or some external cover needed  otherwise just garb one friends its really killer,4
when i get the cellfone i noticed that the box does not have the headphones i bought two xperia xz and both dont have the headphones and they have to be clearer that the fingerprint sensor dont work on this version,2
this was a gift for my wife she loves it the most remarkable feature of the xperia xz are its  m front camera and its  m rear camera she loves taking pictures and this is what she loves most about this phone,5
super awesome interface performance is on point design and screen are also one of the best you can find in the market future looking silver design and super bright display lastly battery is great too,5
 less than best buy for the exact same phone prices can fluctuate but amazon has the best price for the exact same phone this is my nd xperia in  years great phonehandheld android computer way better than the overpriced eyephone ,5
try taking  photos in a row in the best setting this thing overheats and then shuts down the camera and you cant continue shooting photos seriously itd be ok for a  no name android phone but for a sony costing  returned,1
the phone itself is good but i have some problems with the usbc port it seems to have problems keeping the cable connected while i am able to charge i know this is a construction quality issue not sure if i would recommend this phone,3
a couple of things id like a lot are the unique design quality of camera and overall functions my money is well spent on this new phone when compared with current version of iphone hopefully the os will be updated soon,4
the note  arrived packaged in great exterior condition however the phones sensors seemed to malfunction for example the stylus pen made sounds and activated on screen tools without ejecting it for use,3
phone works great im using it now except after a few months i realized it only charges wirelessly the plug in port does not work and can only take phone calls on speaker people cannot hear me with regular calls and barely hear me on speaker,3
after a month does not charge unless you turn it off phone is unresponsive to touch unless you pull the stylist so now we bought a phone that was bought less than a month ago now we have a bad refurbished phone and out the money,1
phone was great at first but the phone has been cutting out and not it just shows a black screen i have not had the phone a full  mths yet there is no dings cracks or water damage waiting to hear back from seller about issue,1
i am not satiatfised with the product because the battery is weak and it has scratches also the phone didnt come with a samsung charger rather a sony charger and the battery doesnt last more than  minutes from being fully charged,1
this is by far the best phone on the samsung line even getting a reconditioned one like this the battery life is pretty good i had absolutely no corks or problems with the phone and its the second time ive purchased from this seller great phone and very powerful,5
im so glad i bought this phone its in excellent condition works great and the battery life is better than i thought itd be it came with the charger and s pen all i had to do was put my old sim card in and i was up and running,5
after reading some of the reviews from this seller i was worried but its been two days and the refurbished phone seems to be as good of quality as one one expect a refurbished phone to be it was a good buy and i am happy,5
its great i still use this phone tell this day no problems and have had for months which i was worried cause it was a refurbished product but they did the referb well i would totally recommend saving money and buying through this outlet,5
worst product i have ever purchased the phone came broken and had no s pen the charger to the phone burnt a hole in my carpet and the bottom of my foot the customer service department took forever getting back to me and only replaced the s pen,1
i bought the galaxy note  a few months  months ago now there a burn image on the screen im very disappointed because i bought one for myself few months ago and mine is freezing i will never purchased a phone from yall again,1
i have been very impressed with this phone it is doing everything i am asking it to do with ease and timeliness the spen is in good shape and works perfectly as far as i can tell the phone was in perfect condition without a scratch or rough edge anywhere,5
phone lost its screen after  months no damage shock just stopped working went from normal screen to view of back lit internal components to totally black no recourse or support expensive  months of phone use will never use this vendor again,1
i am disappointed with my phone because im on vacation and all my pictures are turning black its either some few which are okay i had  days contract i dont know whether they are still there im coming back in usa on th may let me know how you me thanks,1
i loved the phone until not even a month later the screen started going out my mom got the same one and its still running fine so hopefully my new one doesnt have the same problem not happy about having to wait for a new one and deal with returning this one,3
the device was an excellent device i bought in december since then no issues is still working excellently well the battery life is good i also appreciate how the seller send the device in time and also send me a follow up email to make sure i got the device,5
i like the speed and the screen resolution of this phone so much good camera also you cant tell this is an used phone by the appearance if all of your products are like this one ill keep getting more stuff from you,5
not worth buying i got this and after month it gets problem picture is out of focus cant see pic on next page showing i have no sim card i really want to return for refund but cant cause of warranty do not buy this item,1
i was terrified of buying a phone especially one i hadnt seen the phone looks brand new fresh out the box new cosmetically  system  no problems at all i am very very happy with my phone the company is great will def be buying from them again in the future,5
the bad review its the first time to bring something from amazon and i feel sad also without his charger and no headphones  btw they wriete in the descrbtion that the mobile with the orginal charger and orginal headphones ,4
the phone wont update at one point it started glitching another thing is video stabilization doesnt work on this phone the phone allaround just seems like a very bad deal the condition of the phone was very good but functionality is bad,1
i will have to reserve my opinion on the battery life but so far so good we have to get the cost of the new phones down and this is how i have been forced to do so get delivery on this phone and everything went smoothly,5
ive been using this phone for a few months now the charger that came with it failed and i can get about  hours out of the battery im not keen on spending  on a phone to spend anouther  to put a battery in the phone otherwise its pretty good,2
i have had this phone for about a month and never used the pen untill a couple days ago but i noticed the pen gets stuck everytime i put it in and click it then its hard to get to come back out other then that the phone is flawless,4
i would give  stars but i cant phone was not unlocked and the battery fully charged only gets mins of life do not buy from this seller i plan on filing a lawsuit for false advertising once again do not buy from this seller its a scam,1
item came as described and looks as if brand new very pleased with service love the phone except cant used data while talking on the phone and some apps require wifi to complete the app install other than that the phone is amazing,5
love this phone the battery life is crazy good display is crisp and the speed moving through apps is great came from a samsung galaxy j and this phone blows it away good camera and not to much bloatware using it on tmoble,5
excellent product i sent a device dual sim additional to this i found a headset that is the positive but the negative thing is that i did not find the data cable otherwise i am very happy with the product and service,5
when i contacted motorola for support they asked me for the imei and told me it was from india and they couldnt offer me any support it would have been quite helpful if the product mentioned explicitly that there was no us support,2
excellent phone durable battery fast good screen this model is the xt it is a little heavier if compared to another phones like lg gmy previous phone lg g it is thick too but this is because of the battery good camera and good photos,5
beautiful smartphone fully satisfies my expectations the screen suitably wide to see the images clearly the possibility of using the smartphone as a projector thanks to its compatibility with moto mods is exciting,5
i bought this phone thinking that it was unlocked but it was not the phone doesnt work in costa rica where i live i tried to get the unlock code with the vendor but they insisted that the phone is unlocked a waste of time and money,1
well the phone was working fine for a while but out of nowhere the screen has gone black i can still feel it vibrating on touch and hear it startup and receive messages the support window closed less than a month ago too,1
ive had this phone for about a month so far i have no complaints it runs fast thanks to that ocotacore processor it runs apps beautifully and it takes pretty good pictures even without the hasselblad mod,5
good battery but slight defect on my modelmay buy another so see if defect improves  problemrear of your phone will scratch with a sharp fingernail too much money for a backreturn scratcher because you refuse to build the phone correctly,2
its really a beautiful phone great for its price the battery life on this phone is incredible crystal clear pictures and i get so many people telling me how beautiful this phone is im crazy happy i purchased this phone,5
in perfect condition but when i tried to set it up there was still a financial obligation on the phone the phone company would not let me activate it and i had to send it back waiting for my refund so i can buy a new one elsewhere,1
phone came unlocked and sim card free had to load a sim card for the sprint network into it and then i could activate it on my plan phone looked and felt like a brand new device extremely affordable very happy with the purchase,5
great value for money works really well even got dunked in salt water and survived amazing the finger print reader was scratched when i received it so that doesnt work but i dont care ive never liked the finger print reader,5
its a bit slow but its what i could afford at the time and works well enough dont expect to play any large games on it but mobile gaming is horrible anyway so i wouldnt even bother on a stronger system other than that no real issues,4
i just purchased the samsung galaxy s gp gb black onyx  sprint certified refurbished and was able to activate the phone same day with sprint as the phone came with a sim card also the phone works well and is in like new condition,5
havent had any issues with the phone but the compatible charger is of very poor cheap quality i had to buy an official one within a week  never use a charger that isnt official this does make me nervous about the future and quality of my purchase,3
wasnt even wiped from the previous user would freeze and restart all the time and left me without a phone for a full day at work when i have to have a phone on the job never buying from this company again just stress and loss of my time switching phones,1
i have had phone for only six months worked well until now it now drops calls and battery often runs low even though i charge it nightly and only use phone to make a few calls or texts would not purchase again,1
i was hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone having bad experiences previously with refurbished products but this phone works great it is fast has been very reliable quick to charge a very solid phone,5
i cant activate mine because theres no sim card not in the phone of the box ive called everywhere close and no one has any they just tell me its supposed to come with the phone so now im stuck with a great phone that i cant use ,3
upon receiving the phone in the mail and before the package was even opened i saw a deep crack across the home button i didnt even open the package immediately sent back the home button cannot function like that no way it could read fingerprints etc,1
this phone clearly said ok for sprint after spending time making an appointment going to sprint working with tech we found out it was not compatible with sprint so frustrating dont trust what the description says,1
the phone is great i gave  stars because i did not get a sim card or the correct charge cord i did not contact them because i had it sent to my senior father that lives across the county and it was easier just to go directly to sprint,3
what ever you do dont buy anything from the seller i purchased this phone from what a joke called sprint to set it up and they still owed money on an acxount this phone may as well be a brick useless couldnt select no stars,1
terrible just terrible i was excited to receive a new phone after years of waiting only to receive a half restored and google locked disappointment not worth the  or the  mile road trip to find out it wasnt even restored properly,1
got the samsung note  and found out its knoxed still works but not to happy that it was sold while knoxed meaning that it cant use any samsungs own features once its knoxed it loses that it should have been noted in the sale,3
i really luv my phone didnt have any trouble switching it to my sprint account havent had any problems at all i was able to add insurance on the phone thru sprint and i would buy another phone from here when i need to very cheaper than going right thru sprint,5
we set the phone up over the phone with sprint replacing a sprint phone but it just kept resetting and kept updating for days took it to sprint and they started over but it would randomly shut off and restart a huge bummer,1
good phone just not for sprint sprint dont do prepaid anymore didnt do that till after i bought this i would not recommend sprint to anyone they dont communicate with there customers until the customer calls to change something,5
bought this phone my brother bought the s edge for almost  last year for a great price brought it to sprint they did the rest you cant lose i will buy my phones from amazon but i like to wear them out for a good  or  years first,5
great phone overall back part of phone was broken could not get phone set up for this provider now have a  video streaming device not satisfied want to return if the darn app would go to the return section,3
the sim tray was broken and wouldnt recognize my sim card so i am returning it im sure the product was good but i got a busted one and that was disappointing also the first night i had it the battery died  while laying on the table not being used,3
was great at first but ive only had this phone for  months wont hold a charge has a hard time charging wont notify me of calls or messages my alarm is very quiet and its turned all the way up very disappointing,3
the battery lasts only a couple of hours product is not of good quality and has a battery defect expected better product from what is supposed to be a certified refurbished phone do not order you are better off paying the price of a new phone,1
my provider said that whomever owed this phone first never paid it off so i cant activate the phone until its paid off im going to try calling sprint to resolve the problem but this shouldnt have been a problem to begin with,2
received phone as expected  it was in immaculate condition physically took it in to sprint to get activated which was not a problem but then the phone got stuck in a continuous boot loop and got very hot device is not usable,3
the battery drains from  in a short period of time  hrs the phone looks in great condition but with a bad battery its only good for a paper weight im going to try to install a new battery if i cant contact the seller i would not recommend this seller,2
love this phone i also have the turbo  i bought this one for someone who needed it and setting it up and playing with it this phone may have been released  years ago but it sure does stand up to the newest phone arrived promptly and mint condition,5
i ordered this phone for my  year old we received it in  days i wish it had come with a usb charger instead of an wall charger and also no ear buds were included other than the things mentionedi am satisfied with my purchase,4
this was an identical replacement as i dropped and shattered my screen its only been  days but the phone seems to be working ok if i ever need another replacement phone id have no problem looking to amazon  edge cellular again shipping was prompt,5
ive had the phone for a few months and i have a very protective case on it and have never dropped it it wont stop turning off and restarting ive tried many fixes online but nothing has worked also the battery in unable to be removed,1
its my first android and i only use it for business i didnt even know it had a fingerprint scanner until now lol its very clean battery lasts forever and all the accessories i got for that price it was well worth it,5
if you like verizons prepaid plan then this is a great phone for the money everything a teen needs in a phone just make sure to purchase a micro sd card with the phone because the gb phone has gb remaining after the operating system is installed,5
not enough space constantly telling me that i need to delete apps images etc in order to update or do anything on this phone i have a huge external card and ive moved everything to that that i can move and to no avail does anything fix this issue hate this phone,5
ive had this phone for just little over a year avoid this phone if you can so far ive had to do six factory data resets luckily ill be able to afford a galaxy s next week so i will be upgrading this phone is really bad through avoid if you can,1
phone came with android  upgradable to  phone is really nice and it was worth the price but i do have a couple minor complaints and thats the battery is just ok and i expected the screen quality to be better,4
it says unlocked and will work with metro pcs but it didnt work took it to a few phone repair places to see if it could be reflashed but nothing worked i hate google for making the phone soooo exclusive that you can only have it with one carrier,1
this phone is in good condition good appearance and quality with original charger just like a new phone the seller provide very good service as well only one concerning for me battery drains a little fast need to charge everyday,5
this phone is terrible extremely slow at bringing anything up i had another google pixel xl before this and never had any issues this was definitely not worth what i was charged can barely do anything with it,1
battery lasts  full days much faster than any other phone i have owned love the size uses usbc connector so had to buy a couple of extra cables because i only owned micro usb but works great use with mint mobile,5
not a bad phone for it age it updated to android  without problems good reception on cdma battery last   days with below avg use which is a bit disappointing screen is good fingerprint reader is fast camera is also very good,4
i just love my pixel im having so much fun customizing it google support is awesome seller delivered product on time phone was in great condition i transferred all my data from my lg k write to my new pixel no problems,5
great upgrade from an old motorola ultra the phone is the  model but still performs flawlessly would highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade from an old phone and get into one helluva smart phone for under ish,5
worked great for one month now wont unlock and appears to be totally kaput i didnt drop it or get it wet or anything im probably just out of the return window and i definitely no longer have the original packaging so im probably sol,1
phone was in pretty good condition and works almost flawlessly my only complaint was that my s pen doesnt have the carbide tip and doesnt function so ill have to order another other than that im extremely satisfied with my purchase,4
disappointed display looks good but cannot scroll in any app including settings so i have to ask who did the certifying these s refurbished phones can very likely be junk thank god for amazon prime  on its way back for a refund,1
received the phone and didnt workwont be able to return it in time and get a replacement because i leave the countrybeen trying to contact them to send it back and cant get a hold of anyone and theyve been open for an hourdisapointed with the experience,1
awesome phonemagic vr machine gorgeous display fragile and so easy to drop i know kind of a weird thing to say  but its true protect it and buy a squaretrade accident protection deal right away if you get an s,5
bought this phone for my fiance and he loves it he had no problem turning it on and getting it all set up hes had no issues with his phone so farits been about a month  his phone came looking like a brand new phone i am very satisfied with my purchase ,5
nice phone but the battery wouldnt last a day so i had to the phone repaired with a new battery very expensive repair for a refurbished phone that repair that should have been done by my wit wouldnt purchase again,1
i got this phone activated this morning and the verizon representative told me that this is a brand new phone so far so great going from an old beat up s to this makes a huge difference i highly recommend this seller,5
bought from dealfisher phone included a charger overall in very good condition with no obvious signs of previous use battery works well and the phone functions as it should would consider buying from them again,5
received phone early than expected it also came with a brand new verizon sim card very good condition only seen a few marks on the edge of screen only issue i have is the volume up button doesnt work other than that phone works great,4
phone was in like new shape no scratches dings or dents only thing i find wrong is that the battery life is underwhelming will barely make it the day with lightmoderate usage other than that its great for half the price of the carrier,4
since the st week i had this phone everyone who called me constantly told me that they only hear  out of  words i was saying due to the phone cutting out i would never ever buy a refurbished phone again,1
activated easily on the verizon network  have bought multiple from this seller and all have worked out well for me batteries not all there in holding a charge but im typically around a charger so doesnt bother me much,5
if you dont want to pay new prices and you dont need latestgreatest this is a perfect solution you get a very good phone with many of the upgrades without the huge price tag i would not hesitate to buy refurbished and i am very happy to have this as an option,5
item arrived exactly as described the battery has good life on it no scuffs or other visible damage and easily worked with straight talk i have had the product for almost a week now and i have no complaints many thanks,5
i was looking to upgrade from my galaxy s and looked into refurbished phones i found that this upgrade is more intuitive and love the new featuresi received my product with only a small scratch on the bottom otherwise very happy with my purchase,5
phone was great altough not in mint condition there were marks around the charger port and a small dent on the bottom aside from that and the fact that it took me a week to figure out how to make it work with my provider overseas the phone is working perfectly,4
ive only had this phone for a few days but so far im loving it my only complaint which is minor is that sometimes the touch screen is a little delayed overall i would definitely recommend this phone especially for the price,4
this phone has terrible reception we have another certified refurbished s purchased about a year ago that works just fine in the same locations with the same carrier this one is so bad as to be unusable sometimes i emailed quick deals cr but so far no responce,1
amazing phone had to get a new one because my co worker accidentally cracked my screen but i love this phone so much that when i did order a new one i ordered the same one amazing camera quality amazing speed amazing battery life,5
you couldnt tell the phone wasnt brand new except the small scuffs around the edges of the charging port so small that i had to really examine the phone to notice and the port isnt loose at all operates like new for what i can tell,5
i am trying to install verizon voicemail app and it is not possible i went to verizon store and was told that the phone is not verizon phone it is international unlocked phone and the verizon apps cannot be installed and used,1
the s has a slight curve to the screen and tempered glass screens were never made for it much like the s however my husband needs the tempered glass because his phone falls on the ground all the time so it will still protect it mostly,2
no real durability two days in and the screen broke while in a case not sure if it is the build quality of the phone or if during refurbishing a lesser product was used as a screen replacement the phone itself is great but who cares if the phone is super brittle,1

the battery on the phone only lasted  hour even when i left it alone after getting everything set up the return took  month to happen i had to constantly call amazon to get my refund even though the item was returned a month prior,1
the phone works great however they microphone does not work at all so if youre ok with using headphones with a microphone to do anything that requires recording sound or calls then this is fine if not you may need to spend more on a never used phone,3
this was a certified refurbished phone was basically like new condition phone with charger did not come in original box with owners manual is why i rated  stars otherwise no issues works as it should with verizon network nice upgrade from my galaxy s,4
got this for my daughter to replace her iphone  ive gotten phones from amazon sellers before and had bad luck so i was a little wary this one has been a dream easy to setup and absolutely no issues buy with confidence,5

no me agrado porque venden cosas desbloqueadas y no están liberadas estan con deudas hacen perderse tiempo y es molesto pensé que eran más profesionales y vendían productos exactamente como dice en la descripción yo pague lo de aduanas y eso nadie me lo va a delvover,1

iphone came in and looked brand new not a scratch or mark on it im very happy with it price was great too all i had to do was turn the phone on put my sim card in from my old iphone phone and follow setup instructions,5
i bought this phone based off carrier compatibility it is clearly stated that this phone will work with verizon wireless after  hours on the phone with tech support they finally let us know that this tmoble phone will only work on the tmobile and att networks,1
before i even turned it on i tried to put it in a case and saw that the screen had popped out of the casing the phone wouldnt turn on so i tried to charge it the cable was loose in the charging port and the phone never powered on,1
i have this phone and absolutely love the phone but when my screen shattered i wanted a new one so i ordered one that was new nope i paid  more then the used and it has gunk in the speakers and chips in it and it didnt even come with the cords or charger,1
this is an updated post there is something seriously wrong with this phone the regular speaker on the phone works only intermittently and only very rarely im not sure if it is a hardware problem with the speaker itself or something deeper but it is not usable,1
great phone with a beautiful screen and amazing customization options my only complaint is the battery life if you use the phone all day especially websurfing you will barely make it through  hours of use,4
product was listed new this is thereason purchased went to verizon store and was informed item was previously activated not new no worries works fine just couldnt give  stars to a company that lists item as new when missing transparency,3
the first one i got bugged out after less than a day but a replacement was sent quickly and without giving me a runaround the replacement has been working fine for a year now and both the original and replacement were cosmetically blemish free,5
great phone love taking selfies in the dark i found when i used my flash in the dark only the grass in my yard came out well and our barn didnt i never use the edge feature though cus im so use to other samsung galaxies that dont have this feature,5
i have only had this phone about  months and it is not working correctly message  keeps shutting down and now it seems hotter than when i first started using it loved the phone at first but beginning to dislike quickly hoping i can get a replacement,2
great features and easy to use seller was great to work with and help set it up with verizon this was my first smart phone and i am very pleased to have found a seller who cares to help during and after the sale,5
phone is sleek and works well i have a brand new one as well and the only problem with this one is that the battery drains a little more quickly than the brand new one otherwiseit was in great shape and functionally works well,4
everything brand new and perfect working condition good deal with amazon prime return protection purchased from carolina trader excellent price too came with some verizon apps that mostly get in the way,5
had the phone for about  days then got the famous s touch screen issues the screen will randomly select items or drop my notification bar up and down very rapidly have reset changed touch sensitivity to no avail pretty upset with this device,1
i would rate this  stars but the product claimed to have come with a sim card inside however mine did not other than that i love this phone  stars for the phone  stars for the mislabeled packaging,4
its been almost a year since ive ordered this phone and i can honestly say its the best phone ive ever had screen quality is great i love the edge features and ive put this phone though hell and not a single scratch,5
great phone seller was great to work with would order again have had the phone for  months now and no problems way to go when buying a phone for a kid will never pay the store prices again until he gets his own job and pays for it,5
when i bought this phone it was said it was unlocked for gsm and that i could use it with metro pcs when i put my sim card in it told me it was not a verizon card im really disappointed and would like a refund,1
the back cover was very badly glued the phone was locked to verizon carrier and the original verizon sim was left inside the seller requires that i pay for the return label even though it was their fault to sell phone in this condition,1
arrived in like new condition with no dents dings or scratches  battery holds a full charge  activated with straight talk verizon with no problems new buyers should wait for the price to come down with the new ss coming out this week ,5
looked like brand new original box and new charger wire and adapter bought for daughter for gift but her boyfriend bought her brand new google pixel  the same day i ordered this so i returned it really hated to as it was in perfect condition,5
recieved this product and all looked great until i tried to activate it on the verizon network turns out it was a tmobile phone and was locked on that carrier so it was unusable sent it back and have yet to get my money back,1
best phone i had in my life got stolen tried to replaced it from amazon the phone from this seller had a purple vertical line on the screen bad screen contact felt scammed gifted it and got the s still missing the s edge though,1
it is supposed to be a reconditioned phone i dont know if it was done properly i get phone calls and there is no one there when i answer when i am talking to someone theyre voice stops they can hear me but i cant hear them,1
bought a refurbished phone samsung s edge the phone had no voicemail app had a pink line down the screen warranty was up and one day after it was up the phone turns on turns off turns on turns off and never comes back on complete waste of money,1
phone appearance is that of a brand new phone im using tmobil on my unlocked verizon and its perfect no issues my only issue is my battery is draining faster than a new battery would i have had no mechanical or physical issues so far so good,5
so far havent had a single issue with mine plus the build quality is up there with apples iphones and yet this one for the generation had the better screen and camera than the iphone so yes a definite buy from me,5
phone received looked like new no scratches or cosmetic blemishes were apparent at all comes in a generic box with charger and cablenothing else but for the price it was well worth it the phone worked right out of the box without any issues love it,5
gave it two stars only because the only thing the phone i got has going for it is that it looks new and turns on the phone is slow battery drains quickly heats up after a few minutes of light use and the lcd has burns in it,2
i talked my husband into going with this and wow am i feeling stupid now phone arrived dead and will not take a charge another week without a phone because of no fault of my own buyer beware obviously it wasnt checked at all,1
had the phone a couple of days and so far has exceeded expectations super easy to migrate data from previous phone would have been nice to have the adapter included but wifi process worked just fine all in all would recommend this phone,5
i believe i overpayed for this product as it is just a refurbished model with no accessories but it did came mint condition with no scratches or issues and a  day warranty so i am content with the product received,5
had this phone a couple of weeks now phone arrived like brand new not a mark or scratch on it checked out all functions and it works flawlessly battery performs like new very fast shipping would definitely purchase from buyspry again very satisfied,5
got this for my mother as a christmas gift as someone who never had a smartphone before she loves it does everything you would want a smartphone to do and easy enough to learn although a few models behind the hardware is solid love the camera quality as well,4
when i got the phone i had a hard time getting verizon to activate finally after  days i was able to get my phone working the phone is great looks brand new and a lot cheaper than a brand new one you wont be disappointed at all with this phone,5
description says it all the phone itself is in excellent condition but i find myself needing to recharge before end of day with little use right out the box i expected a certified refurbished product to have a better battery life,3
muy buen celular funciona en ecuador al principio no aceptaba el sim card pero nos contactamos con el mail que nos vino en una hoja dentro del paquete del celular y nos dieron las indicaciones para poder desbloquear y funcionó enseguida,5
phone is very easy to use but the battery life isnt that great i could not register this phone with straight talk directly but i could just pop the sim card in and it was working what i did notice was that the signal was not as strong,5
nothing but flying stars for me here i had a ss had for years now its dosent work any more so i got an sedge and i always wanted one good to see that their just ass good as always i love you samsung always will loyal to the end,5
what really makes this phone for me is the speed of the processorits extremely fast of course the brilliant  display is amazing as is the mp camera my only dislike is that the phone is unbelievable fragile invest in a good case,5
i enjoy everything about my sims song i love it the only thing i dont like is that i have metro pc network is an unlocked phone so my network drops every once in awhile my phone calls drop every once in awhile but other than that i enjoyed it,5
no problems at all i have had it for about a month now the only thing that i noticed was there was a a faint scratch on the back but that is the only thing that i have noticed overall i am pleased with this purchase,5

lasted  months then died will not turn on oh well maybe i can trade it in and get a new phone instead of a refurbished now i am back on my old s which is still working lesson learned s was a flawed phone to many bad reviews,3
this phone arrived as expected and it is a new phone it shows no wear or used i am extremely pleased with this purchase one comment the battery does go down faster than expected but with a charger no problem,5
no blemishes on the phone perfect conditionbut a full battery will last me literally an hour and a half with medium battery settings apps freeze and sometimes dont even open overall bad performance,1
el telefono no se encuentra completamente desbloqueado se puede usar en mexico con telcel y solo entran las llamadas pero no cuenta con internet y en euu no se puede usar con otra compania q no sea verizon,1
i bought black onyx and i think this is not it at least it seems ok though got it just today was traveling abroad and just got home lets see rating  star cuz i really didnt want this ugly color and this model is cheaper than black onyx,1
phone has black lines across screen spoke with samsung which referred me to their repair place i was informed that the screen would need to be replaced with a genuine screen for about  my bad for purchasing a used certified refurbished phone,1
very pleased this far arrived in a timely manner and looks new ive been using the phone for  hrs now and learning it this is exactly what i expected and was hoping for good price and good purchasing experience,5
the product arrived on time and in great condition it was almost like it was brand new software works fine and im loving the battery life the new updates are definitely worth the purchase glad i bought it,5
phone came perfect and right on time the only thing that bothers me is if you dont have a verizon sim it pops up on my window and i cant access my voicemail but all in all good product for the amount i paid,4
i love my phone i just dont like the fact that it did not come in  days like i paid for you all should do better because it can you business im so upset because i have been without a phone since i bought it,5
dont buy this i bought two as gift thats why i took so long to review one came with a pink line in the screen the other with two areas in screen with low light and both with battery problems take forever to charge and discarger in one hour,1
not only did my phone arrive late but it came completely destroyed at least some of the other reviewers had a phone that actually worked mine wouldnt even turn on and not even the charger was salvageable please tell me this is a joke,1
i m very sad to say that this iteam doesnt fit as i expected it didnt work on my network so i sent it back to amazon hope next time whenever i will buy anything from amazon would be great work samir parmar,1
after less than tow months  the mobile is two hot and gives me notification that is calling itself which leads to close the programme that i am working with i cant put it in my ears because of its heat,1
this is exactly like a brand new phone amazing it did not come with the tool to get the sim card but i read a paper clip works and it did no ear phones but with difference in price for a new sedge who cares,5
received my order sooner than originally told so a plus there i received phone completely drained of battery but plugged in and charged pretty quickly no problems at verizon activating it and after having for a week im definitely happy with the purchase,5
seller was great edge phone is just waiting to break the screen i dropped it once and it hit the side completely ruined the screen including the led display phone was done for i went back to regular samsung galaxy afterwards,3
the device works well but it can not upgrade from os  to os  because the baseband sm ga and you need a different baseband to get the android os  i cannot even get the  upgrades so i am stuck with outdated software,1
phone has worked well purchased about  months ago and havent had any issues minor scratches on the home button completely cosmetic no issues but otherwise looks brand new works with a prepaid plan  boom mobile on the verizon network,5
it looks and works like new i have the blue corral i love the color i was going from a htc  which was a great phone but this phone is even better would defiantly purchase again the picscolors are amazing on this phone,5
not sure if i just got a lemon but bought in january worked ok through febbut then the battery life goes from sugar to shi in a matter of a couple calls or like a half hour of use very disappointed do yourself a favor buy new,1
im really glad i chose this seller and this phone if it werent for the fact that it was listed as a refurbished phone i wouldve never known it works like a gem and i woukd highly recommend this to anyone,5
the s edge is very nice it is my st smart phone and since its android  samsung just like my tablet very easy to use verizon set it up with a sim card and i was ready to go all my contacts transferred with no problem,5
i used to make refurbished phones and i was quite happy at the quality it appears they replaced all the outside components now with that said wow verizon phones have a lot of junk software and a locked boot loader,5
phone is nice and in good condition however the details said the phone was gsm unlocked when i put my gsm sim card it it said invalid sim must be verizon etc i had to root the phone in order to get my sim card to work,3
phone received is having scratch on top near sim card and also charger provided is not fast charger charger and usb cable provided with phone is of low quality  not happy phone sold was suppposed to be of new refurbished quality it have scratches,1
i was hesitant however the phones came in brand new condition and were unlocked they easily set up to verizon pre paid have had ours for about a month and love them would definitely use this seller again,5
i normally wouldnt buy refurbished electronics but took a chance and gotta say im glad i did phone came in great condition only had a tiny scratch on the back which my case covers anyway screen is perfect phone works great,4
the iphone arrived with minor scratches on the back but other than that the phone works perfectly fine i have been using it for awhile and havent noticed any complications with the battery or anything yet i am very happy with this purchase,5
the phone worked ok for a while now it has interference and cutting out issues when talking on it texting worked fine at first but some seemed to be delayed how but im not sure if thats the phone or the provider,3
remember these are refurbished phone so theyre liable of messing up phone is perfectly fine until it went out  sum days in the mother board went out luckily it was still with in the  day warranty got my refund no hassle and went and just order another phone,4
bought this phone a year ago got it right before i left the country for a year phone worked for  weeks then shut off i tried everything to fix it and took the phone to apple store as soon as i got back and they said they used wrong parts,1
phone started making weird noises right before  days loud noises microphone stoped working then he day that happened my daughter dropped it and broke the screen right on the  day mark talk about a nightmare  is a lot of money to throw away,2
 months after purchase last week no service shown on iphone  i contacted apple store and they sent my iphone to repair i got it back yesterday  iphone worked for a few hours then no service shown again cant make callreceive a call total waste,1
the apple phone itself works fine after a month the battery life shortened significantly now if i am going out for work more than  hours it is better to bring a power cord or power bank also the power cord comes with the phone is from huawei not apple,2
this is the second iphone  purchased to replace antique flip top phones the renewed condition was accurately advertised and the resulting value fully meets our expectations we will not hesitate to reorder from this company again,5
i noticed the screen brightness was really different from other iphones so i took it to apple and they told me the screen is not original the camera is not original etc a lot of parts of the iphone were replaced and not original i lost my money buying it,1
sorry this video is unsupported on this browser  so far so good the phone looks perfectly fine it has some minor scratches but looks great it is fully unblocked and works pretty good im really happy with the purchase,5
defective to fix at the apple store its  bucks no help from amazon i would have been better off using craigslist or facebook marketplace first and last time ill use a refurbished amazon product no customer service,1
the sound from the first day that i received it was very muffled on the phone no one could hear anything we tried it for a while and nothing ever improved i was very disappointed in this phone sent it back and got a refund,1
item looks exactly like the pocture however be aware that on the description it say this is iphone  plus which isnt true this is iphone  not  plus thats why i gave it a  stars the infos were false,3
like the phone is quality the only thing wrong is sometimes the speaker shorts out but it can be fixed by closing the app that is playing audio other than that its a good phone for the price especially with the storage,4
came in right on time had minimal wear just a few tiny paint scratches on the top right corner nothing too bad came in well packaged but didnt come in original box its fully functional for me at the moment,4
the phone can not get any network connection after  months of use apple is telling me that there is no guarantee on this phone this model number had manufacturing issues but apple wont exchange the phone,1
this phone does not work on verizon repeat this does not work on verizon the seller for some reason posted that it does i went to the verizon store and they said it wont i tried online and the system said it wont thanks,1
this has been the biggest mistake of my life this product will not work properly on verizon i have spent hundreds of dollars trying to get it to nothing i will never make this mistake again the incredible amount of time and money i have wasted is unfathomable,1
battery was not replaced before i purchased it which it shouldve been since those are a problem with these iphones  i had to go to apple i have the battery replaced but other than that the phone is awesome,5
very disappointed phone was a model no longer sold due to an irreparable software issue that apple would give a warranty for had it been purchased there waste of time without a phone twice two thumbs down on this one,1
ear speaker has poor quality of sound it sounds like the caller on the other end is far away i checked the settings and it is not a software issue it presents as it is dying or was refurbished with an inferior replacement part,2
there is scratches no manual came with the phone no headphones and worse of all the most terrible thing is it came with a htc charger and it doesnt work soooo disappointed i would give a no star because this phone was not cheap terrible,2
super fast deliveryonly  days the phone looks like brand new and works perfectly so far because its a refurbished phone dont expect the full set of accessories i only got the charger the warranty lasts  days and i will update the review by then,5
product was delivered before estimated delivery and came neatly packaged phone looks very clean with no significant scratches and the screen quality is good however the battery seems to be losing its charged quickly,3
ive had this phone for a about  months now and i am pretty satisfied my only problem was a dead pixel that has slowly gotten worse with time if it werent for the pixels it would have been a flawless phone with no noticeable damage or wear,4
the phone arrived sooner than expected looks great no scratches on screen still in excellent condition works great  bought as a gift  was so blown away by the condition of this phone that im now looking forward to getting myself one,5
the phone itself is in great condition no scratches or anything my spouse wants one now my only issue is the battery seems to drain a bit faster than normal but overall very satisfied it came unlocked and i had no issues adding to my metro pcs line,4
first phone i ever had that wouldnt at first i was sure it was my fault but after a dozen people looked at it and gave up too well there you go i will say the return went without a hitch no fault to the seller,1
i bought these phones for my mom and stepdad they loved it so much they live far away from the us its very nice and they loved it plus it is unlocked so it easy to use it right away i would recommend for anyone especially who live abroad,5
this phone is great i was replacing my first s edge cuz the screen had cracked and stopped working properly this phone in blue coral is gorgeous and it works perfectly it was unlocked i just popped in my tmobile sim card n sd card and it worked immediately,5
many phones ive had the speaker phone is so quiet the sound on this is great i love the curved edge and its performance is really good quality perfect size but a little slick get a cover for it right away,5
wow impressed not much bloatware unlocked looks brand new it is so shiny battery life is great this is an excellent phone for a great price it came with a charger and the sim key i bought it from seller hybrid it thank you,5
aside from a few pieces of cosmetic damage which was forewarned in the description functions exactly as expected if i need a new new to me in the future i shall definitely be giving their wares a browse aaa seller,5
i use this phone as my primary phone i have had no issues with it for the money its a great buy im still new to the phone and learning i have att for service and my information was transferred over with no problem very satisfied with my buy,5
beautiful phone after reading some reviews i became worried about the phone being compatible with my carrier metropcs but everything worked out fine the phone was very clean with no cosmetic flaws as far as i can tell,5
mobile is not working from the past  days it is not getting charged and it is not getting switched on at all i thought of returning but unfortunately i found today the return window is closed before  days,1
she loves the phone works perfect only thing i didnt like is the packaging but you get what u pay for and also it didnt come with the original fast charger but i happen to have extra laying around the house other then that phone was as expected,5
this past weekend i fell into a lake while loading my boat in a downpour my  edge was completely submerged for a couple seconds and it completely survived not so much as a hiccup so i guess when samsung says its water proof they mean it,5
very disappointed i received this phone today that was supposed to be unlocked took it to the store to get services and found out it was locked and also phone has  different ime numbers  red flag i want my money back,1
overall i am happy with the phone and its performance if you expect that the att bloatware is gone from the phone youll be disappointed however it is unlocked which does not come across intuitively when you receive it,4
i bought this phone as a gift for my sister and when she received it she could not use it because it required a verizon sim card do not buy this expecting to get an unlocked phone they are being dishonest,1
the phone seems to work great so far  it was sent with a defective charger i was told my hybrid it that they would replace it but that never happen so i had to buy another one which added to the initial cost,3
the phone is in perfect like new condition i have got it all setup now it is on tracfone and everything is working as expected i did put in a att tracfone sim and it worked great i have now purchased another for my daughter,5
this phone is a beauty no scratch and clean like new i had a gold one couple of month ago and i lost it the blue one looks cool too the only thing i have to do is go to my carrier and reactivate my sim card or you might do it via phone call,5
screen started bubbling up after  and a half months  and they wont do nothing about it  its also very ironic that it started doing this immediately after the  day warranty was up  if i could give them a zero i would  do better ,1
i had a note  which i loved but it finally gave out i thought about getting the note  but it doesnt have any features that the note  doesnt at least that i would ever use plus the note  is way to expensive this refurbished note  works and looks brand new,5
i understand that it is refurbished but i just opened this phone to activate it and it barely turns on the battery life is non existent whoever the seller is should be ashamed of themselves for sending out a device that is crap,1
i had phone for only for a month and after an updated was required paint started appearing on screen and now screen is all black still waiting on the respond from seller it has a  day warranty but im still out of a phone,1
nice phone clean and reseted charger is some off band phone didnt come with sim card need to go to sprint store to get a sim card best way is callchat with customers support for activation after install sim card,5
the phone was great for  months one day phone decided not to turn back on so money is wasted on a phone i cant use had to go get a brand new phone from mobile i loved the note  but after this purchase im done with samsung,1
received phone today it was to be an att phone its a tmobile all updates say tmobile so disappointed as i had to wait for awhile for it i realize i can send it back but does not show an att as avaiablesaid multiple places att,1
i previously had the samsung galaxy note  for several years i honestly like it better than this note  there are too many little things both good and bad different between the two phones to mention but biggest thing ive noticed is the battery life is much better,3
bought refurbished worked for about  month then touch screen started to give trouble flickered often home screen would rotate randomly touches did not register had to do a factory reset and worked again now its doing the same thing again,2
the phone worked fine for about  months until all of a sudden the screen started turning purple on the right side there was a small spot now the spot has cover the whole screen i asked and they told me it was a defective screen,1
the phone itself is great the charger that came with the phone does not go with the phone and the little accessory tool needed to put the sim card in also doesnt come with it as well i bought this as a gift for my husband may be returning it,3
bought to use with straight talk service however couldnt receive picture text or mms the phone i received was not factory unlocked it was an att phone i ended up swapping service to att i like it ok but miss straight talk,4
the song they sent me continuously restarts out of nowhere and when i called they said that they couldnt replace it and i have to send it back with an inconvenience i would not buy this phone at all i would hop into buying a factory unlocked samsung galaxy note ,1
phone was nothing as described i needed an unlocked phone to use as a byop to a specific service this phone was described as an unlocked phone when i went to set it up i called samsung to find that it was still locked had to send back,1
i have had nothing but trouble with this phone shuts off for now reason wont have signal or receive calls and it shows full service and everyone around me on there same service is working fine this has been the worst phone honestly,2
if i could give it  stars i would ive been using this phone ever since i got it every day it hasnt skipped a beat if you told meit was brand new when i got it i wouldnt doubt it for a second great phone and great quality,5
this phone doesnt keep charge  dies very quicklyspen broke into the phone after a few weeks and the bottom of the screen doesnt touch thats what o get for purchasing a refurbished phone have used it since,1
literally the month after the warranty went out the touch screen stopped working and i was forced to only use the spen just a few days ago the phone stopped working all together dont waste your money with this seller go on ebay or find someone else,1
really great phone for an older version this one is in great shape sometimes the touch screen dose not respond and the camera gets a hiccup every now and then but otherwise able to work from my phone again is a blessing,4
buy note  in this store it left damaged does not turn on i lost my money i bought it for my sons gift in honduras i can not return it but they should not sell phones that do not work they should have better quality control,1
i bought this phone i cant hear without using an earpiece was planning on returning it but then decided to use it now it got worst cant hear without without a head piece so im sending it back too much stress,3
the product was defective fingerprint not working touch screen dead on the upper area noticeable signs of wear the worst purchase ive made on amazon dont buy from breed i started the refund process but didnt receive any update for a month now,1
phone was clearly not renewed i stored it in my drawer for emergencies and now the screen does not turn own seller ekings refused to refund refund period is not long enough for a defective phone go to another seller,1
i got everything right brand new device with small scratches in the loaders engrada and nothing else just did not like the accessories came only lg charger handset is samsung did not come headset most all right i recommend,5
i love it its a samsung phone anyway new used or refurbished its still a great phone cant complain i knew what i would deal with great communication and description of the phone by the seller so no complain,4
i have to go back to my carrier if there anything they cado or help me because i cannot use it without using a wifi at home and at my job theres wifi but outside data is not working i use unlimited data,1
this was a terrible phone it does not work with att i was in the store and on the phone for hours noone could get it working with the network do not buy i am returning the phone and now i have nothing,1
ordered this phone and it arrived very quickly in really great condition its refurbished but it looks brand new everything works perfect really great buy i wouldnt second guess buying it again or buying another for a family member definitely recommend,5
i specifically wanted a refurbished cell phone for environmental resource conservation the phone was as advertised and was just like new for those wondering the phone did also come with a sprint sim card so you do not need one from the sprint store,5
phone works extremely well looks brand new no issues what so ever switching from my s to this s i called sprint customer service and they activated the phone right away it came with new sim wall charger and cord earbuds definitely worth the buy,5
touch screen became unresponsive from rd month of usage it is frustrating when you cant answer calls or cant use p q keys for example trying my best to get sony fix it but in vain do not buy  thats in plain english,1
appearance  usage  at time the internet connectivity or bluetooth will disconnect and will not reconnect even if you switch them off then on the only way it will work again is to restart the entire phone cant trust sony for ohones anymore because of this,2
great mid range phone  the phone in my opinion should retail at  and be on sale at  but overall well balanced no group texting issue compare to my previous xperia z however the phone needs to dual speaker as a standard,4
i actually returned this phone i originally bought it because i wanted a cheap phone with a good camera but saw that the camera wasnt as good as id hoped however it was a nice phone besides that and returning it had no extra headaches,4
display has a brown streak on it after less than two months edges of touch screen do not work very well and require special attention in order to get it to work overall the touch screen in not very good hope they can fix if for me,1
made a mistake of buying this xperia xa the screen sensitivity is erratic in bottom left side could not use back button could not type many letters on left and right edges sometime its high sensitive all over gets app activated automatically,1
worst thing you can ever spend your money on i wasted almost  the camera is awful the video is in black and white not color it freezes every minute the only good thing is it memory capacity you are better off with a samsung or an iphone,2
the worst phone i have ever bought for dollars it stop charging after  months of usage and send to sony for repair but it didnt fix the charging problem i guess you have to get a top phone like iphone or a samsung,1
do not buy this phone an unbelievable amount of people have all had the exact same problem with the edges of the touchscreen dying sony refuses to take any responsibility for this issue i will not be buying another sony phone,1
its good for the price but it has a factory defect that the sim card does not stay inside of it and i had already loaded all of my information into the phone by the time i found that out its very annoying if you can live without a sim card its fine though,3
lasted less than a year before dying it worked well although the right side of the screen was not very easy to use to select something or write when touching it but lasted only  months not worth the money,1
ive been a dedicated advocate of the sony xperia phones however i discovered later that this one is not full hd not a huge deal breaker but certainly suprising considering its one their newest phones,3
was looking for an affordable phone with higher storage space am sorry but this is an international china quality phone with the worse camera ever invented i sent it back same day not a phone for instgramsnapchat lovers,1
i would advise anyone not to buy any electronic stuff from amazon i bought a sony xperia xa from amazon and one week after the touch on the phone spoil now i cant get my money back because i dont live in america,1
careful when purchasing phone many users are having issues with the touch screen i have had mine for only a month and need to have it replaced since the right side of the screen is no longer responding to touch,1
edges of the touchscreen go bad making the phone infuriating to use if it werent for this the xa would be a great budget smartphone as the rest of the phone performs perfectly there is a bit of sony bloatware some people might not want,2
system fails a lot phone freezes a lot battery dies fast there is a known bug called sudden death where the phone shuts off but responds to the power button being touched itll buzz used to love the phone now i love to hate it,2
i bought this phone thinking it would be great because its a sony but i was wrong the narrow screen stopped working on the edges months into having it even though it was never dropped or wet ill never buy another sony phone again ill stick to their tvs,1
just got the phone today and will be returning loudspeaker does not work seems to be an issue which sony has no fix for my mistake for not researching it fully wasted  hours troubleshooting back to samsung for me,1
terrible glitchy phone common google functions like voice search dont work smoothly if at all performance doesnt match the specs long lags when switching tasks touch unresponsive tap whack slide  the phone is finger deaf replacing after five months,1
 months later touch screen malfunctioned warranty is included up to a year when you buy this phone they promised up to  weeks to get it repaired and sent back well its been a month and still no phone ive had metro pcs phones lasts longer,1
this phone got a software glitch  days after the warranty was up hmmm pictures were not great either wish i had returned it when i first got it phone is unusable xperia companion and cell ohone repair man unable to get the phone back in working order,2
the phone was packaged nicely and phone was in excellent condition phone was gsm unlocked which made it very easy to set my service up on it metropcs only thing i didnt like was it did not come with headphones still  stars tho,5
the phone looked alright but when i started using it i realised the earpiece is not working and i cant hear anything when i get a call i sent a message to the seller and they havent even answered my message,1
extremely bad well the inside of the phone works fine but outside is extremely scratched its nothing like the description says it has the sim door bent sides completely scratch as well as the camera glass and screen,1
this purchase was the worst ever the phone does not work dont waste your money there was so much static and interference and when you answer an incoming call it sounds like water running down a drain,1
i ordered this to be as close to a new phone a possible it came with no real box and no headphones very upset and definitely not worth the money now so much for it being a christmas present if i could give you  stars that would be too many,1
cool phone just  things im not happy with  its kinda slow lags a lot   gigs is not enough since just about every app needs to on the phone and cant be moved to sd card i would buy a sony phone again just maybe the next tier up,3
works great runs smooth but the volume is crappy i did know that when i purchased it because there is supposedly a way to make it louder camera seems to be good i havent had the chance to make actual prints to see,4
great phone while it worked i had it for  weeks and then the screen stopped working i pressed different buttons to try to reset it and i could hear the operating system working but the screen never returned back on,1
i really enjoy this phone due to the size of the screen the clarity of pictures and interface only thing i dont like about the phone is the glass screen just have to make sure a protector is bought im clumsy with phones so its a must,5
this smart phone is very slow waiting for it is a way of life the alarm has a mind of its own i set it for  am and it frequently rings at  am or some other strange hour the buyer can do better than the sony xperia l,2
i suspect this product was not brand new it had been used before and the reset because the box was open and the phone freezes a lot these are a few among a few more things i noticed about the phone love the phone itself just that i suspect it was not brand new,1
i am pleased with the phone have it for a while now and the only thing i have noticed is that i have made a mistake by not getting one with more on board ram my previous phone is also a xperia and i love them nice phone i made the mistake,4
there was no implications that this phone was coming from japan it has the camera shutter on all the time there is no way going around this effect it is best to just return the item there is also a small dent on the sound button onoff i am extremely disappointed,1
i love this phone it came fast its like brand new they also sent a free  month mint mobile card months free mint mobile with gb of data unlimited talk and text no strings attached thank you sooo much,5
its the phone im using now to write this review  im super pleased with the purchase it also came earlier than expected its kinda hard to think this phone was used lol its so like new works well and goes beyond satisfactory,5
everything was ok till i use the phone i saw a damaged pixel high quite light on the screen and this type of description is important when you aré buying refurbished phone this data didn t appear in the post,3
this was not actually unlocked i cannot use it with my verizon sim card at all i have wasted time and money on this now i have to send it back and hope i get a refund also the charger cube that came with it was a samsung brand thats just not what we bought,1
i used it almost a week everything goes well except the poor battery life i have to charge it more than two times a day i am not sure if they really did the test for the battery health the battery capacity of my phone does not have a minimum capacity of ,3
it wasnt fixed like advertised it was supposed to be certified refurbished nope i never but then for exactly that reason maybe i created that experience should i try again with refurbished how else to get an apple,1
the phone is great the condition was not certified to look and act like new i dont think so more like scratch and dent which is how it came had to immediately get the battery replaced but it works fine just would prefer a correct description,3
i got this phone as an emergency replacement and although it doesnt conserve battery very well it has decent memory for all my apps and is compact with good features dont feel like i am missing out much and dont have to be doing monthly payments for a  phone,4
bought this for my daughter for christmas so not sure about the overall preformance of the phone yet but it looks new and was easily added to my existing sprint account and seemed to work fine before i wrapped it,5
this phone isnt fully unlocked like the ad says when i got it the invoice says gsm unlocked which is not what i wanted i had to go to verizon for them to tell me it isnt usable for verizon now i have to send it back,1
dont be fooled by the reviews saying it worked with sprint we just got back from sprint and they told us this phone is not compatible with sprint cdma sig we are hopeful our return goes smoothly and will look for a phone that is compatible,1
phone was all good my only complaint is the cameras shutter sound can not bet turned off very annoying also if you are looking to buy this phone it says it works for verizon but when i got the phone the paper inside said it might work with verizon,2
the phone come locked i tried to unlock it and att toll me that it has unpaid balance linked to your device unbelievable how can amazon sells a product online that has got unpaid bill on it what to do now,1
i really liked the phone but its not really unlocked i couldnt register my phone on verizon had to use my old sim card couldnt put the phone on my insurance the phone works great like brand new condition,4
amazing purchase no scratches or even lines the touchscreenreen without a trace nor even a fingerprint the side bottoms were absolutely fine so is the home bottom and the back front was clean i would definitely buy again here,5
i was skeptical on buying a phone from amazon but so far im content i bought from buyspry and the phone quality was good a couple of minor scratches but overall good however the speakers sounded muffled as if the phone had been dropped in water,3
might be a new screen and case but the innards might be old the battery doesnt seem to be new it holds charge but drains quickly so far took a while to switch over to the newer phone apple makes it a pain,4
received a pristine iphone s and was surprised that the screen and body appeared brand new i wouldve preferred that it had a new battery as it only had a capacity of  but for the price im very satisfied,4
the headline says it all ive emailed twice so far with no response i cant use the phone at all as its saying i cant activate it as its still locked maybe this review will finally get a response from the seller,1
im using this phone right now to write this review its great works perfectly fine nothings beat up or scratched  except for the ones i made after getting it  and really has no issues as far as i can tell,5
the screen had glue the cell phone came in a generic box and with a generic charger not the original and the most important i have big issues it is not working well is very slow and looks like it has not the capacity for working well i want to return it,1
received phone pretty quickly noticed right away that the mute switch doesnt work properly after i put it in service i discovered that the speaker doesnt sound like it should it but at least the software and battery seem to be working fine,3
wish i knew i needed sim card in order to get verizon to activate the cell servicehad to wait additional days to receive the sim cardotherwise the phone looks great and i look forward to my upgrade from iphone ,4
ive only had this phone for about a month and the screen went blue and now i have to pay more money to get it fixed i havent dropped it or cracked it or anything its in perfect condition and the screen is a tint of blue,1
phone arrived promptly actually earlier then when originally ordered hard to tell the difference from a new phone and also included a new screen protector no issues with the phone and happy with the purchase,5
bought to replace an old iphone s the screen cracked only in a couple of weeks after a mild fall from kneeheight with the protective case on you get what you pay fora refurbished item wouldnt be able to handle physical impact like a brand new product would,1
john really likes his new phone it is bigger than his old phone so he can type and read messages so much easier there are things he is still learning to do but i think this phone is going to be great for him,5
this arrived exactly as described excellent condition and i activated in minutes it also came with a screen protector no dents or scratches just got it and very happy about it will update if anything changes,5
the phone works great except the battery life is terrible i have to charge the phone at least  times a day to keep it from dying even on airplane mode at some point ill have to take it to apple to get a new battery installed,4
the phone delivered had a very much used battery apple battery health is showing  capacity which is severely low this has prompted apple to disable peak performance as a customer i am dissatisfied that the refurbished phone didnt have a battery in good health,1
the unit arrived in excellent appearance the problem was the volume of the earpiece volume was low and i couldnt change it the voice to text was awful breed authorized a return immediately now to see how quickly they refund my payment,3
the battery is not working properly on this phone it does very quickly and needs to be charged at least  times daily other than that the screen and other button are in good shape with a few scratches and dents,1
still has plastic on it no dents nor scratches i love it it is unlocked havent tried making a call to hear how the speakers work because its a gift for someone i will let them tell me but i am satisfied with my item,5
the product came in and was gernally in good quality just with a slight light spot on the top of the screen the issue i had however was with the battery life the phone came in with the battery health at under  and the phone loses battery at an incredible rate,2
unexpectedly poor phone family is on the same plan with the same iphone s however my gps and data cuts out unexpectedly while theirs remains strong completely frustrated with this phone would not recommend this seller,1
the phone looks great works great curretly using it to make this review i havent charged it letting it die but have gotten  hours on a red bar the screen had a protector and the housing was in great shape sd card fit right in,5
looked new with no visible scratches it also functions as a new phone ive had this phone for a month and never had any issues with it it came completely unlocked so it worked great with my local sim would recommend this purchase to anyone,5
sorry this video is unsupported on this browser  the iphone it came on time came very neat it only had  minor scratch by the speaker but the rest of the iphone is in great condition also included a temper glass awesome no needed to buy one,5
i ordered an unlocked iphone s in rose gold i received an iphone s in silver as well as not unlocked so cannot be used shipping was fast but that doesnt matter when you receive the wrong product that has possible technical issues,1
i bought this phone to send it to the caribbean for my brother birthday and the ear pice is not working properly also the volume is low but it already in the caribbean so i can return it back so next time i am not going to buy refurbished items learn my lesson,2
overall decent phone no noticeable scratchesdefects the battery is bad at  capacity and not good for gaming  even binging youtube videos since the phone heats up good for basic functions but no one buys a fancy phone nowadays for basic functions,3
i bought this phone and gifted to one of relative i came to know that battery drains with in  mins i am feeling very bad i gifted such worthless product i gifted i bought many products from amazon and now this incident impacted me very bad,1
i just got it today and it looks brand new for a refurbished phone it was easy to transfer everything from my iphone s to this one after putting my sim card in the box was torn up really bad but the phone was safe in the smaller box that it was in,5
i have very little to complain about with it being refurbished i had low expectations the phone came earlier than expected it works perfectly and there is no glitches with the phone for less than  the phone was quite the bargain,4
i ordered this phone and it arrived in about a week it was overheating and drained battery i returned it and got another one shipping was great the second one is working perfectly fine overall a good purchase,5
phone is in great shape and works wonderfully the battery wasnt in the best condition but that was an easy fix i scheduled an appointment at the apple store and they replaced it for  they will do this through december  ,5
there are some software bugs besides that its a pretty good if you need a one right now the pictures quality and battery life is lower than i expected even with those issues i think it was worth the compromise,3
the product was better than i expected had it for about a month now and there are no problems except that the camera shutter doesnt turn off which is a bit annoying the phone had no scratches or dents and looked perfectly new,5
i was very disappointed that the silence button on the side of the phone didnt work especially since the phone was said to have gone through a thorough inspection i would not recommend this seller to friends or family,3
received my phone earlier than expected which was great i have cricket service so it was easy to switch over phones phone is in great condition no scratches screen is clear so far so good i would recommend this seller,5
the phone is in good condition looks and feels new works with us and international sims however the battery lasts between hrs with brightness at minimum wifi off and without sharing location ouch asked the buyer about battery life and never recieved a reply,2
im always sceptical to buy such big things online but i took the chance and this phone has been nothing but great so far it works well and it comes in a nice package where its protected i recommend ,5
got the phone march  and started using it immediately by march st  days later the phone was shutting down for  minutes at a time and restarting on its own agenda i have to return this iphone t may be refurbished but it doesnt work,1
this item is in mint condition not one scratch not one blemish i took it to the apple store and compared it to a new s and saw a very slight difference in overall color i am really happy with this seller and this item battery is also very good,5
bought the phone for my seven year old only flaw is the battery shuts the device off at  since its a refurbished device i wasnt able to use the battery test function fingerprint for security doesnt work and the phone started shutting down randomly,3
battery would not hold a charge for longer than minutes ended up trading it for a new phone fortunately they accepted the device two stars only because i was able to trade it in and get my value out of the phone save yourself the grief and just get a new iphone,2
i like the quality of this phone ive had for  days now and my only complaint is the battery life but once i replace the battery it should be fine but for a  phone its not bad other than that the phone works great,3
do not buy not unlocked i had to pay to get it imei unlocked only to find out they did a software unlock because neither phones had a clean imei phones were dead within a week this place is a scam,1
the phone chargers fast but it also goes dead fast the battery doesnt last long  the charger that came with it has a shortage in it  overall not worth it he money i paid but my niece likes the phone so its ok,3
battery could use improvement but that is the manufacturer not the seller i was apprehensive about buying an unlocked iphone in amazon but not a problem so far love love love it performs as if it was bought from the apple store itself so im a happy customer,5
i do not want a large phone nor do i use the phone for extensive videowatching or game playing i make calls send texts read email and listen to audio books and it is perfect for that without spending ,5
arent refurbished phones supposed to have a replaced battery the battery health of this phone was  when we received it tried it for a couple of weeks but now it just shuts down randomly and intermittently bought from buyspry be careful with this seller,2
so glad to have a phone again but the battery is seriously awful will have to go purchase a new one ive turned off and modified everything i can think of to keep it from draining as quickly thats the only drawback i just watched it drop  typing this review,2
phone said it was locked multiple times after putting in my sprint sim card from my other phone stays good for about  min until the lock message appears did this process  times while also restarting my phone in hopes of it working big noticable scratch on phone,1
purchased  of these and both are  battery health and they specifically said in the description at least  very disappointing to have to immediately go now and buy a replacement battery these were christmas gifts for two young kids and the batteries are bunk,1
extremely disappointed came in defective no volume on the earpiece something that is totally inexcusable no qc obviously made for a very disappointed birthday for my daughter no excuse for this never again refurbished means it should work as new pathetic,1
disappointed in the phone when it arrived it didnt turn on i automatically thought it was a battery issue so i paid to have a new battery installed after that it still didnt turn on pretty much trash never again one star for fast shipping,1
this phone came to me without a single blemish or imperfection at all it charges super fast and stays charged very easy to set up just went from a samsung note to this s and i thoroughly enjoy it ten out of ten would buy again,5
overall the phone works well but the battery is the problem only  of battery life remains there phone will shutdown automatically when the battery runs low if i could know this problem i wont buy this one,2
the phone was in good condition and only had a few scratches around the charging port which i was expecting from a refurbished phone i was surprised that it came with a screen protector already on it which was a plus this is my first iphone and im pleased so far,4
compre un celular iphone  s  el sistema operativo no funciona  que trastesa mi primera compra a este proveedor y sale mas caro el arreglo que el costo del celular se queda blanco con la manzana en el medio,1
my battey life is  percent and cant be replaced by the company the battery drains really really fast i usually have to charge it within a couple hours and i cant pay the additional charge to get a s plus,3
this phone looked real purty and thats it it was glitching as soon as i turned it on and would die sporadically even with a full battery i needed a phone for my new business and this has cost me time and money super disappointed,1
i really like it there were no scratches everything works perfectly they had a screen protector already on the phone and they included a charger that works pretty well overall im completely satisfied with the purchase,5
i didnt appreciate the fact that the phone came loose inside the box it could have been packaged a little more safely other than that it looks brand new and seems to be in working order so far hoping i dont have any issues out of it thank you,4
poor poor poor try send a voice note the message takes forever to start record volume so low have to put on speaker to hear for both incoming and outgoing calls press screen sometimes it doesnt respond,1
phone came with dents in the top corners battery life was at  of life and unexpected shutdowns due to degraded battery overall would still buy i just swapped the battery for  and the phone works great,4
absolutely do not buy this phone i lent my girlfriend money to buy this and she got it with no battery life shed have to keep it on a charger to keep it alive then she replaced the battery and now its in boot loop and wont update i want my money back,1
my samsung galaxy refused to charge anymore so i had no choice but to get a new phone so i went back to an iphone i waited a while to give my review because i wanted to make sure that it was going to work good so far so good i dont have any complaints yet,5
this iphone is perfect for me i paired it with tracfone bring your own phone service and it works great the customer service from the seller is excellent battery life on this iphone model is known to be sho that is not the sellers fault,5
the delivery was faster than expected by a week but the phone itself has scratches at the top part worse still is the battery that died off very quickly although phone is cheap but battery is already unusable and has to be replaced,2
i bought this i phone s for my wife as a replacement phone the price is fair and the delivery was fast i also got it with screen protectors and a rubber case i feel like it was a great value and most importantly my wife loves it ,5
second time i have purchased a refurbished iphone from amazon never had problems either time in hindsight i would not recommend paying extra for the rose gold color which i did just use the money to get a nice case to protect it if dropped,4
sometimes i think the older models do so much its had to justify a newer one this one has worked well since i got it my wife uses it daily i have a newer on but its twice the price and i see no advantage,5
arrived quickly in like new condition i have sprint so i bought the fully unlocked  phone activation was easy on the my sprint account page was worried it wouldnt work for sprint but no issues so far,5
dont buy a defective refurbished product from this seller the phone died within  months of purchase and apple says that it is not possible to repair since the issue is with damage to the charging port during the refurbishing,1
at first i was reluctant to purchase an apple iphone i thought it cost too much however after i purchased this iphone i do not think i could ever see myself with any phone other than an iphone this phone rocks,5
this iphone plus is supposed to be a gb its only a gb it is supposed to be certified refurbished and unlocked it apparently isnt unlocked because the phone is not compatible with my carrier and cant help me,1
love the large screen apple goofed when they eliminated the separate jack for head phones forcing you to choose charge or listen button is highly sensitive and often unlocks when i just want to check the time lots of memory and slim design,4
i ordered this phone since my carrier is verizon and it is advertised as gsm unlocked but this phone is not unlocked it only works with att  tmobile so if you have any other carrier do not buy this phone super upset about this,1
love the care in packaging and it came with a screen protector preinstalled could have been listed as a selling point and its actually finger print resistant device is perfect and couldnt be happier with the purchase,5
sorry this video is unsupported on this browser  very happy with my new apple device befor i use samsung s now i will never go back to android fast smart easy to use and beautiful iphone recommend to everyone no damage no scratches  from ,5
love the phone i gave it a  overall because it came with a scratch on the back i understand its refurbished and these things can be expected but thats why i gave it a four star rating other than the scratch on the back everything seems to work fine so far,4
there was no ear phone and whatsapp soundi dont know when i receive messages on u whatsappthere r d things i didnt like and i hope these are d only complain i might have for the phone the paper it came with is very blurted,4
first day with phone was delivered fast seems to work fine so far other than the speaker sounds a little off but over all the phone is in good condition no scratches or dents no problem switching phone on my metrot mobile network was a att phone,5
i dont like that they sent me a phone with little small stratches on the screen and then tried to use tempered glass to disguise it but everything else works fine so far hope there are not any other hidden problems in the future ,4
upgrading from a s not a fan of not having a headphone jack but some wireless bluetooth earbuds work just fine the camera is something else the only negative ive noticed is the wifi range seems a bit weaker than my s,4
gb memory is way too small for a modern phone operating system and preinstalled amazon and google apps which cannot be uninstalled leave less than gb for your own apps even using a memory card for photos and music doesnt really help,1
ive had this phone for a few weeks now not being tech savvy i was pleasantly surprised how simple it was to navigate picture quality is great and the battery lasts several days just a really nice phone i would purchase this phone again with no hesitation,5
wow this phone is fantastic for its small price so many useful apps some bloatware but with all the apps and bloat im still at  gig left free space then plus micro card  i wish i would have known about this phone when it came out,5
super impressed with this phone great battery life impressive screen quality and very good sounding speaker on phone samsung quality at a great price point so much better than my galaxy s would highly recommend,5
i have had my j smjvpp for almost a year now and i dont have the first complaint it has not failed me as of this review samsung make very good products i just wish there were more operating systems in place to give google  apple a run for their money,4
looks like a good phone but prepare after like a month of use for the phone to get so lagged up it takes  seconds to open an app even with daily cleaning it will be very slow when battery reaches below  percent it becomes completely unusable,2
i bought a j perx and nothing but issues with screen touch so they sent me a brand new one and thinking oh its new i must of gotten a bad egg so i sent my old one back and the new one was even worst my original j was way better then these perx nothing but issues,1
very happy with the phone only issue started occuring recently is when using the phone for an actual phone call i constantly hang up on the person or mute the conversation im confused why this is happening all of the sudden,5
this phone was a disappointment compared to the other galaxies ive had it takes forever to get to just the homepage  out of  tries to get the app youve selected to open i will be getting another phone for sure,2
right out of the box and the touch screen is slow and prone to freezing its a cheaper phone but you want to get more use out of it thsn a few months the size is nice camera is just ok memory just ok speed is slowish but not terrible all aroung okay phone,3
internal speaker seemed to be loose or defective as the persons voice would disappear for  seconds at a time bought replacement with the intention of repairing the first one and it has the same issues,1
total crap nothing worked and ate up my included data just trying to get it set up instruction book is short and useless kept downloading every time i turned it on and stopped me from making a  call,1
i bought this phone and used it for awhile but the constant lagging and poor performance made me switch back to my lg running marshmallow and its still faster and better than this junk i wouldnt go back to the j perx if you have it to me for free total garbage,1
this is a great update from its smaller sibling the j emerge or j luna pro or primewhile most specs are the same i believe the bigger screen is the most important also being booted up with android  right out of the box is great,5
i never write reviews but damn this phone sucks it is very laggy i dont have any apps opened yet the g of memory is in constant struggle i switched to iphone again it just doesnt work guys get another android phone you will regret it,1
samsung should be ashamed to have made such an inferior slow phone it stalls and god forbid you have too many browser windows open  it gets overwhelmed very easily avoid this phone at all costs a note and above is your best bet,1
this phone sucks balls big time very slow  freezes in a heartbeat for no freaking reason this is my rd samsung in  yearsswitching to iphone next time if i could give it zero stars i would it really deserves minus ,1
awesome phone for a much better price than verizon could offer my old verizon phone didnt have a sim card so i had to go to the verizon store to activate they had no problem activating it for me i love it,5
this  phone has established itself as my prizeed possession i have  phones  the j the lg x power and the zte warp  by far the best of the  smooth as silk fast as lightening and and flawless in operation who could want more,5
item is shipped in a box without air bubbles or bubble wrap to protect it from slamming around in the box first phone i received had issues with the screen flashingshowing double the second one i received works great,5
purchased for my mom as her first smartphone great phone be prepared to activate and wait  days while the prepaid flag gets cleared despite my willingness to pay the difference nothing could be done to remedy the prepaid status of this phone,4
the camera is absolute crap but if you download an app using that with the camera works well i dont understand that at all but whatever works battery lasts forever tough phone pleased with my purchase,5
other than the fact that it stops charging properly about  weeks into using it it would be a great phone so now im sht out of luck because neither amazon nor verizon wants to deal with it another hundred fifty bucks down the drain,1
this was a great way to upgrade had tried  other  plus phones from another company but both had problems wanted to upgrade to ios  maybe the phonemaybe the company this  plus is a great buy and works perfectly,5
product arrived in quoted time the phone is flawless and truly fully unlocked it came in a generic box with just the plug dont expect the apple box with leaflets  couldnt have asked for more just what i needed i would use this route again in near future,5
phones sold here are not unlocked be aware before you order it may it may not work with your carrier  in my case i have a sprint line and the phone i received was with another carrier  i had to return it,1
just received this not sure why so many bad reviews on this my son is  i ordered for his birthday   he loves this phone my oldest daughter set it up for him im very pleased  he plays fortnite on his and says the graphics are the best,5
 battery life it took four hours to get a full charge and less than  minutes to lose its charge entirely and i ended up stiffed with the return shipping fees the rd party seller blames everything on software awful experience,1
i purchased this phone and for the first week it worked good the second week after receiving it the screen was static and it continuously rebooted i have send back the phone and requested a refund i am still waiting for my refund,1
it says it is renewed and looks like a new apple iphone also that it is checked up by amazon professionals it came and the back of the phone was cracked and the camera was shattered second time in  week trying to buy an iphone off amazon neither of them worked ,1
the phone arrived on a non protected box and the phone was not un good condition as the description says the screen has a lot le scratches and also dead pixels the body of the phone is very damaged it seems that has a lot of falls before do not buy this phones,1
i always get nervous about purchasing a product when i see bad reviews but i was happy to open my package to my new iphone  plus in perfect condition there we no scratches cracks or anything wrong when using the phone very happy about my purchase,5
phone looks great came with screen protector already installed although genuine apple charging hardware would be nice only thing is the phone i received was not compatible with verizon luckily im switching networks anyway but its still annoying,4
when i got the phone and called in to activate  i was told it was an iphone no plus it was supposed to be an iphone plus and the box said it was an iphone plus i could not setup voice mail at all even though it was unlocked for any carrier,1
looked like new had to update the os which was a bit of a pain had to plug it into a pc with itunes to update it but after a couple of tries it worked then transferred old phone info over easily wife loves the big screen and camera,4
this was the best investment i made the phone came on time and looked like new i didnt find my scratches on it and worked perfectly it paired with my old iphone and everything synced into it in matter in minutes i recommend this product,5
did not come unlocked not a big problem for me personally but if you are looking for an unlocked phone i would not suggest this phone other than that the phone is in great condition and works perfectly,4
very annoyed to see that the phone doesnt work with verizon even though it states in the description otherwise please dont buy this product the apple store instructed me it only works on limited networks,1
the phone works totally fine even outside the us i bought it for my mom and its working pretty well in brazil except the fact that it doesnt come in the original box with original accessories youd never say its not brand new,5
when i bought this iphone i thought it was gonna be bad cause i was reading the reviews but its bad i had the phone for a couple months and no problems at all its a great buy but the price issa no it should be less than that,5
i was nervous about purchasing but i must say this phone is like new and in perfect condition i received mine shipped to the bahamas from mywitt its a great buy fully unlocked and  percent working so far so good,5
it has  gb of storage and over  gb are used by the phone cool i needed those  apps ive literally never opened but cant delete way more than the photos of my newborn son the phone will get you by but you cant keep anything on it,1
tmobile pawned this off on me this is a horrible phone battery runs out overnight it only has g of memory g is used up by operating system goes to voicemail whenever it pleases buy any other phone than this one,1
the phone itself is fine but i cant have more than  apps before it says out of storage space and that is with external gb storage many of the apps required internal storage huge headache please dont buy this,1
how do you f up this badly an fing cdma phone is not a gsm phone hopefully theyll make it right in the meantime im out a phone that i needed for work because these people cant see a blazing bright verizon on the back of a cdma phone,1
when i open the box and turned on the phone there was a large pink line that ran from the top to bottom of the screen see attached picture i will now have to return the phone and wait a week for refund,1
very disappointed it was stated the device was gsm unlocked upon taking it to tmobile it rejected the sim card they said is would not work checked with att to find out that it could not be unlocked due to an over due payment so the phone was not gsm unlocked,1
i ordered ga unlocked phone att unlocked however i received the v verizon which requires cutting the sim card with scissors to make it fit im very disappointed ive asked for return instructions and label,2
todo genial llego a tiempo pero con defecto y procedieron a enviar el reembolso deverian de buscar una opción donde uno pueda resibir el mismo articulo sin tener que comprar nuevamente y tener que esperar tanto tiempo,5
the home button was all scratched and didnt have the gloss on it so the fingerprint scanner didnt work the home button also crackled when i pushed it and there was a bad burn in of the keyboard on the screen,2
everything was perfect for a day but now there are harsh horizontal lines across the screen that wont leave otherwise its functioning like a dream i didnt kick out  for a phone in worse condition than the one i had prior,2
overall i really like the s edge my only complaint so far is the very poor battery life even when the power saving mode is turned on the battery drains very quickly for a new phone once it gets down to around  better find a charger fast,4
the phone arrived quickly and just as described it looks brand new i have had issues with it automatically shutting off which i learned was because of an app i had since that has been resolved i havent had any other problems the picture quality is amazing,5
hate this phone takes offer pictures and wont hold a charge battery usage is very draining horrible avoid this post is about the phone not the seller so i am not knocking the seller at all only this phone,1
everything about this phone is good its not a fake samsung the package is good the only problem is that its locked to att it has the att logo on the back and straight talk wont work im still having trouble unlocking it ughhh somebody help,4
i ordered a gt but i got a gu hich works great with all carriers and is better than the t also in amazing condition the only reason i dont give it  stars is because it did not cane with headphones also charger us generic but no big deal love the phone,4
ive been using the phone for a week and i really love it it came with no scratches looks like brand new and like other users i received the verizon version not the att version as the title stated but that hasnt been a problem for me,5
phone is good but battery seems to go down a little faster than i thought it should in ref to the gsmu  not a worry for me as i am in barbados and all the us additions do not apply here i am happy that was the phone that was delivered,4
phone arrived quickly and was as described works great just inserted sim card completed phone set up transfered all info from old phone and began using right away very pleased after one week of use phone was like new,5
i loved it ive been using it for more than a month now and it has never failed the only thing was that my old phones chip didnt fit into it and also the charger is very low quality but other than that definitely worth it,5
the product i received was not a ga but a gv the far left side of the screen didnt work half the time and the phone came with a generic charger which is expected i immediately had to refund it and waste my time and money,2
hello after i brought this phone camera was not working and sounds was in and out i had to get a phone techician look and fixed it i was charge another  us  wont be buying another phone like this again,1
a parte de que desde que se compro presenta pantalla con rayas roja  lo compre y hoy en dia ya no me sirve para nada no funciona y se apaga constantemente mi peor inversion son muy fraudulentos no compren nanda,1
the phone lost the ability to connect to any service provider  weeks after the warranty expired it never worked rightthe phone was never damaged at all this company wont do anything about it dont buyspry,1
ok so i take picture with it in the rain in the rain now the botton  recent and back button do not stop activating the phone is useless refurbished from what update the phone is dead now buyer beware,2
battery seems to die fast but i love how easy it was to switch to my metro pcs account and love the camera and the fingerprint id that i can use to unlock all my apps plus i can do  fingerprints so my husband can get into it also very sexy phone,5
i like it and its good quality for the purchase price i am a fan of samsung galaxy and i just needed a replacement phone in a hurry and didnt want to spend  plus on a phone insurance is also available with this phone would recommend,4
it is unlocked for some carriers but not uscellular even though i was told it was battery doesnt last very long on it but its in amazing condition better than i thought and other than it not being unlocked i am very happy with it,3
i love this phone i have owned s and s and have found it to be an excellent phone i am in the outdoors a lot and have been caught in some bad rain storms ive never had to replace my phone because it got wet and there were times it was soaked,5
this phone would not stay charged it was stuck on call forwarding and would even show me missed calls it sometimes would recieve and send texts and sometimes didnt it hung up on about every call it was a mess,1
i had to send back my first phone it kept doing resets while downloading apps or anything so i called the seller and they made it right within thirty days ive had the replacement for over a month and its been working fine,5
this is an excellent phone which far exceeded my expectations it came unlocked for the international market i work a lot on the outdoors and it is robust and an intelligent smart phone with many features i am really happy with my phone,5
this phone has a completely unusable phone jack my headphones cant even plug in considering how much i paid i feel so ripped off fortunately i rarely use it but it also took me forever to figure that out,1
phones was great for about  months never dropped it treated it like a baby even though its touted as ultradurable and  months in i have a pink line running down the right side of the screen as others have pictured total bummer,1
its a wonderful phone but it is not indestructable the screen is virtually unreplaceable nobody stocks the components and they are expensive and the process is challenging even for the professional shops once the screen is broken the phone is trashed,3
note  is the best smartphone ever samsung should reissue it as it was but w modern upgrades such as a new processor but keep the phone fundementally the same w removable memory  replaceable battery,5
when buying refurbished you always have the risk of the product not being perfect which is what happened with this phone phone would go into an endless restarting loop when the battery reached  percent refund process was a breeze though,1
the phone case and screen were flawless and the phone is now active and wills serve me well i think it will need charging a little more often than i prefer but it does quickcharge nice phone i love the stylus,5
bad phone someone should check these phones if they are climes to be refurbished there should be consequences for this blatant act of ignorance buying a phone that is bad hurts everyone especially the customer that spends hours reconnecting phones,1
very satisfied with this amazon refurbished phone looked very clean like new i installed the verizon sim card from my previous note  and it powered up immediately logged in to my google account and my new referb cell was ready to go all in less than  minutes,5
poor battery performance full charge ran out after a few hours of use wouldnt maintain a g signal and had issues with the touch screen i dont think they are refurbishing these to samsungs standards,1
the phone was locked and verizon would not unlock it tmobile is my carrier and they couldnt unlock the phone and they tried to get verizon to unlock it and they refused sending it back cant use a locked phone,1
i ordered this phone and when i recieved it it had an image burned onto the screen when i first turned it on what a crap first impression had high hopes but i am returning the phone mistakes happen but if these phones are being sold they need to be checked before,1
i drowned my note  when i fell in a creek after a week of being submerged in rice it still didnt recover this replacement is perfectno battery issues undetectable evidence of wear ive had it for over a month and wouldnt know it was refurbished,5
ive tried several before i got a good one this may be my last note unless they start making them with removable batteries again i love being able to carry several batteries the resolution on this is as good as he new ones in my opinion,5
many useful new functions then galaxy  edge such as iris recognition keyboard setup always on home recognition i was very used to google interface if you install google now it replaces bixby interface,5
unopened and sealed package delivered vendor provided return usps letter with clear instructions phone was an international phone so the plug provided from samsung doesnt work but vendor provided an adapter two thumbs up,5
i have had my samsung galaxy  plus for two weeks the screen images are crystal clear and i can easily see images with the large  inch display while it is a good phone i cant find anything to justify paying over a thousand dollars after tax and accessories,3
i went in the water and i got an error when about to charge moisture detected but i researched how to fix it on youtube and its working fine now  takes really nice pics upgraded from s to s  pleased,5
its a very good phone with a very bad finger print reader i am never able to get it right in the first attempt its so pathetic that i dont use it for anything because it mostly takes multiple attempts to unlock sometimes i even get locked out of apps,4
ive been using my cell for two and a half months and the camera auto focus system suddenly stopped working it wont focus either on normal camera o selfie camera i have to tap the phone in order for it to focus i am very disappointed with this problem,1
nice samsung the galaxy s is fast and easy to handle its battery lasts twice the time of my old s the screen is fantastic great resolution and brightness it has great features and to me it represents a great gain compared to the s i will look forward the s,5
opened the box and found a phone without its basic covering protection either in the front or back weird for me moreover there was a scratch on the screen and that confirmed me it was not a new item seemed to be refurbished but sold as a new item sent it back,1
the device was very clean and had few scratches and good battery life but the speaker makes weird annoying noises and the seller never mentioned it overall nice seller and phone but the speaker hurts my ears sometimes while playing games becuz of subtle ratling noise,4
el cargador que vino con el celular no es el de los enchufes regulares eso es una incomodidad que debió precisarse en la descripción y adjuntar fotos de cómo es para no comprar si en nuestro tro país no va a servir el enchufe original,3
i wouldnt recommend anybody to purchase this phone at least from this seller trust me the battery life is poor and it gets hot very easily however the biggest problem is that nobody seems to hear me when i make or receive a call i believe the antenna is defective,1
i love the phone came on time and it was a little more than i expected got the whole complete set including headphones and charger the screen is crystal clear and the color is excellent the phone works great,5
it is a wonderful phone the camera is excellent it is very high definition it is just a very fragile phone for me i have little kids that sometimes take my phone and there is no case with a bumper to protect the edge screen from braking if the prone fells,5
i love the new nintendo great button feel and colors for my grandson would definitely recommend for other people looking for gifts for their grandkids glad i finally found one on amazon these were too hard to find at target and walmart,5
when i took my phones in to get my information transferred the guy told me that there was a couple of images burnt into my screen they were very light and since everything was transferred i left it not very happy the ad said they are inspected by qualified people,1
phone is good for refurbished minor chip on paint by charger port does not effect phone the reason for  stars is it came with a zte charger  and the galaxy s plus requires  charger so sent a charger that would under charge and harm the battery,2
bought this phone and first of all it was the wrong color and second the most important it wasnt compatible with verizon that was the whole reason i bought this phonei am returning this one and going to my verizon store,1
first off someone needs to be home to sign for the phone secondly buy your own charger the one provided doesnt work besides that everything so far is great  for a  phone is a winwin for me ill update if anything changes,4
brought my phone from delta team copy that and i wouldnt buy it from any other seller had a issue they took great care of me right away phone came in new sealed and love it great price to for a new phone my next purchase will be from them ,5
the fingerprint scanner is really finicky and the battery lasts about as long as my s actives battery didbut on the  side of things the phone itself looks brand new and seems to work as that also only been using for a week now but very impressed so far,4
shows that it is a verizon phone it wasnt totally unlocked when we started with our carrier our carrier had to connect to the internet to release it totally verizon items are still on phone and wont remove,3
sorry this video is unsupported on this browser  do not buy this i bought this for my mom  but instead i got an empty box with fake jewerly in it the seller name is samsung but it is not dont be foul,1
i was supposed to receive the smguzkaxaa  but received a smgfzkdxsg instead what i received is not compatible with verizon this is a phone for the middle east not the us attached is a picture with the phone info showing it is a united arab emirates phone,1
this phone took amazing video and pictures while it worked i called samsung because i could not turn it back on the rep said the warranty was expired and it was probably a used phone she said it happens a lot i had the phone for  days im trying to get a refund,1
of course since my old samsung was an s it took a bit of learning the phone its self works great while i hesitated because it was a refurb it works as promised very pleased with it just wish i could have plugged it into my head and understood all it did ,5
rd month with phone and its progressivly gotten worse phone does not come with all features of normal s plus such as wifi calling as well as some camera features it also drops random calls as well as wont let people call you randomly spend your money elsewhere,2
the s is new and box seal unbroken experttechs did it right i have root access or administrator access to the phone it also receives system updates from google after three system updates the phone is using android pie ,5
i could not register the galaxy s with samsung i called and gave samsung support the information on the phone it turns out i received the uk version it can not be registered in the us temperatures are in centigrade and i bet some distances are in kilometers,3
phone is fine works like a charm but when you go and register the product the warranty is already expired by at least a year or a few months we ordered a replacement model and the issue remains the same dont order,1
i didnt use the phone after having a verizon tech check it out he said it was not a new phone he said the screen had been removed and glued back on and very poorly i returned the phone for a full refund,2
bought this phone because i thought it would be unlocked and could be used with cricket the phone did not come unlocked and actually seemed to be a tmobile phone seller did not respond to message so now i have to see if there is somewhere to unlock the phone myself,1
phone recieved was brand new with all accessories so far everything is working great no issues screen display is great the facial recognition works great and opens phone fast only been two days so we will see once it has been used longer,5
this is the nicest phone ive ever had i was worried buying something this expensive from somewhere other than the manufacturer but it arrived on time and in the original box was a breeze setting up and the resolution is absolutely amazing,5
battery life is abysmal even in power saver mode  phone is difficult to hold fingerprint scanner is at best so sometimey it is frustrating you would think that after  years that samsung would have had a fix for these problems,1
phone has all kinds of gadgets however it cannot do the simple things like make and keep a call humm anybody make a phone that works additionally let the person buying the hardware choose what software is installed ,2
i waited a couple months to leave a review because you never know with these phones but this is the nd unlocked samsung i bought off of amazon and i must say it was a great buy as well not one complaint everything works perfect,5
neutral froze a lot had lag might be an individual issue i did a lot of research about the phone and saw common complaints i was really not happy with the purchase but deemed that it could have been an issue with the individual phone,3
the phone was delivered to me in good working condition but after weeks phone stop connecting to the internet tired everything network reset took it to the store finally i decided to return the phone in less than day sorry i purchased the phone,1
everything was amazing at first i was kinda scared that i would get scammed however it came like it was brand new the only problem was there was a little scuff on the bottom of the phone but it was really tiny so i can barely notice it thank you,5
returned the item because its not a fully factory unlocked phone still have the att apps in the phone and wifi will not work with other company even though i return everything and even the gift card back to them still charge me  restocking fee,1
actually the phone has software problems specifically when i open any websites like google or other sites on the chrome its only opening  out of  site so i genuinely request you to solve this problem before i think on returning the phone,3
i have tried to get the phone to accept the sim card it is an unlocked phone phone just keeps restarting and restarting i have been trying to return it for a week now and no response really disappointed,1
phone seemed great but constantly had a message about service provider update after inserting sim card which rendered the phone useless spent several hours trying to figure out the problem and called samsung cricket sprint but nobody could help,1
samsung galaxy s is a very good phone my review is all about the description it says unlocked i tried to use it with boost mobile and it didnt work i try online by phone and in the store going to return it to amazon,2
got this for my wife for christmas she loved it she had never owned a high quality cell phone before and this one blew her away definitely recommend it only problem is the s came out a couple of months later,5
i am pleased with this brand new factory unlocked samsung galaxy s plus i leased one before and it was good the shipping was great the contents of the package was secure with packing peanuts and it arrived quickly and no problems,5
great product just had problems at first with it but downloaded cover g lite network mode on the play store and havent had a problem since the problem was it would do a glitch screen and then shut the screen off,4
lol love the phone it has everything and now its got android  pie the sellers name is experttechs it came exactly as described no scratches anywhere i was able to register it no problem im happy,5
the product came on time and package came wellprotected with all original accessories backstory is that my s plus fell and broke and i sold it and bought this to replace it  i am please with my purchase i was a little worried but all worry has been rrlaxed,5
i just received this phone today came in earlier than expected i am amazed with this phone everything about it is so good i was a bit nervous about buying it online but after receiving it and starting to use it i am so glad i did it,5
hi i was buying clean phone  but i got previous verizon phone  the phone is not compatible with tmobile when i returned the phone i needed also to pay for return  in general i wasted my time and also my money very unhappy,1
recently switched from and iphone  to the s bought from this merchant and i am very very pleased with the phone it came it today and there was not  single scratch anywhere on the phone it looks brand new would highly recommend this merchant,5
i loved the phone but after  months of use i have now the black screen of death i tried everything online to repair it but nothing worked i felt like i had been had i had to go back to my old iphone  plus horrible purchase,1
excellent phone with incredible battery and its extremely fast it comes without all of the carrier bloatware and you still get  of all the features worked perfectly by just inserting my verizon sim card from previous phone without having to go into the store,5
this phone is fantastic and for the price that i got it here is even more amazing it cost almost  less than on samsungs website that was by the time that i bought it it might not be right now stuff change price all the time,5
what i like the most is the overall phone and all that it offers i gave it two stars because it lacks the critical functionality of wifi calling if this unlocked phone had wifi calling the i would have given it  stars,2
buenas tardes el celular que recibi tiene rota la pantalla en la parte inferior por lo que solicito se me realice la reposición o se me ayude para poder comprar la pantalla que tiene un costo en ecuador de  dólares,1
i used moto samsung lenovo mi pixel huawei blu and iphone in my experience samsung phones are well tested working and largely compatible to external devices like  mm jack sd card car bluetooth bt earphones bt speakers nfc fast chargers etc,5
do your research and you will see this is the most breakable phone ever mine cracked twice  without dropping  even though i have the samsung case designed to protect it great phone but that  monthly deductible will drive you broke no pun intended,1
i didnt buy my s from amazon but i did buy it unlocked and if you try to activate it with a network under their bring your own device provisions you need to ask for an isim card csim and usim type sim cards will not work,5
the phone itself is pretty good and have had the phone about a month ans i was in class and dropped it fell out od my pocket and the screen shattered i have never had such a cheap screen they want more than  dollars to replace it,1
ive had this phone for a few years now and its great but its really starting to show its age booting up osrs and playing it for  minutes really drains the life out of the battery cells unacceptable for  performance,1
still on android  sep   completely outdated firmware a lot of bloatware on device very unfortunate upgrade policy great hardware but software  firmware sucks never again samsung just very much behind,1
this is am an awesome phone look at all the features it as and the gb never have to worry about storageit like everything you want to pack into this device i love the features and the phone itself samsung did a great job creating a phone like this,5
this phone replaced my wifes iphone  getting used to a different operating system has required some effort but she is doing very well with some experience we could never get the iphone to pair with her cars bluetooth system but this phone pairs very easily,5
i absolutely love this phone i made the switch from apple to android with the latest phone updates and it was the best decision i could have made there are so many more things you can customize with the phone and its settings it really makes it personal,5
if you love samsung you will love this phone battery life is amazing for a large screen display is mediocre hence the four stars easy set up and use phone works as expected only phone i have found that actually works with android auto,4
i have had my share of cell phones and this is the rolls royce of them all arrived nicely packed and connecting it was easier than expected this came with oreo  already installed  stars all the way around i simply love it,5
more satisfied with this samsung galaxy s than any other cell phone ive had to date reasonable price new  unlocked with plenty of features and apps had absolutely no problems with the phone and would buy another if needed,5
replacing my note  nice phone tmobile store pro was impressed with the deal i got for this  still figuring out bixby i thought it would turn off the ping notifications sounds either i have more tutorials to do or it just tells me how to do this,5
i bought this phone because it was a us phone unfortunately this is an international phone and is not usable this is the first item i have had to return from amazon hope it goes smoothly because it was an expensive piece of worthless to me equipment,1
the glass on my phone broke while it was in a case in my pocket you cant find repairs at a reasonable price anywhere making the phone effectively a paper weight i will not purchase another device from samsung again,1
nice phone im so glad i bought here and saved over  dollars vs verizon just keep in mind you cant get voicemail notifications but as far as price cant beat even allowed me to do payments no credit check or interest awesome,5
ok so they say its refurbished but i truly think this one i bought for my hubby was brand new still on japan time from samsung  nothing in the box was generic it was all samsung great purchase  it came the same day i bought it,5
its not that great of a phone it doesnt come in white its curved on the edges so finding a screen protector that doesnt collect lint on the edges under the protector i cant wait to trade it in later it sucks,3
absolutely gorgeous phone and display gorilla glass screen being indestructible is a joke its the most fragile smartphone ive ever owned extremelt disappointed with all aspects of samsung customer servive,2
i bought this phone to go back to android after many years with the iphone community i still very much like apple products but needed a little more versatility and customization s was the perfect phone with which to make that transition,5
was kind of skeptical at first about ordering a phone from amazon ive always got my phones from my wireless retailer but this phone has been flawless so far only been  days easy to hookup to att works fine no problems would definitely recommend buying this,5
it came very quickly and was in perfect condition it came in unoriginal packaging without headphones but i did receive a us fast charger i have had a few stutters now and then but it has had excellent performance so far i would recommend it,5
the only reason why i rated that many stars is because i have to go to the store and have them replace my battery for the first couple days the battery only lasts maybe a half an hour before its at  other than that phone is beautiful,3
the phone no longer turns on after  months of use samsung will not honor their  year warranty on the phone because my invoice from us wireless has no identifiable number proving i purchased the phone from us wireless through amazoncom,1
i love this phone it has great features great battery life and a awesome camera the phone did come with a few tings and a crack on the top right hand corner but its nothing major it is a refurbish phone,5
after having the phone only since latter part of october it has since stopped working and will not receive incoming calls rendering it useless spent almost  hours with carrier and tech support to no avail,1
 omg if you have the knowhow you can get the sony xperia xz premium to render everything in native k continuously and its pretty easy but before even doing that the phone is pretty beast as it is right out of the box,5
im diggin this phone i live the clarity of its photos the only issue is the update pings are seemingly repetitive i update on an item then i get the same notification soon after i am especially happy about the expandable memory,5
the best phone in the world i put  stars for the package it was completely broken i was afraid to open it because i thought that there was no phone or it was broken fortunately the phone was in place and works fine for  days thanks for quick delivery,4
love it everything i expected after being a heavy iphone and samsung user but always a sony lover i finally found a phone  i could get into the phone is beautiful and amazingly fast gonna be a keeper for a long time,5
its a really great phones its extremely fast and sonys version of android is very close to the stock version low light photos could be better for those of you on the fence watch the you tube videos of the xperia xz premium vs iphone x,5
this is a fairly impressive phone with a beautiful body i have used many of the current flagships such as htc u oneplus  galaxy s updated to the latest firmware yesterday and it has been running smoothly hopefully this phone wont let me down,4
great phone best i have ever had but ludicrous that i need to flash the firmware to enable the fingerprint sensor this is being returned that is just  up beyond belief i can easy do it too but wont,1
this is not a real dual sim card phone plus sd storage you need to choose either  sim cards or  sim card and sd card i want and need all  like in the previous dual sim xperias and there is no fingerprint option therefore just  stars,3
the phone is awesome and recommended strongly best of android phones however the amazon price is expensive as it cost  in our local market  yrs warranty i suggest that amazon to revise the price specially that they sell it without yrs warranty,5
just got the phone yesterday and im loving it so far this is my first sony phone ever and it just looks and feels like a high end device it performers smooth and fast k hdr and ps remote play are big plus in my opinion,5
the battery is terrible it dies on me in  to  hours without hardly any use i like the phone except all the updating i think this is why my battery dies so fast sony needs to fix this problem especially when the battery is not removable,3
omg when i bought this phone i didnt realize that fingerprint doesnt work inside of usa it makes me feel so bad because of it everything is fine after it but if i had known that i would not have bought it just that im angry,1
sold as refurbished but was definitely used apparently those mean the same thing nowadays but this was still a great deal on a used phone slight burn in can be seen at the top where the menu bar is but thats a design flaw after normal use glad to save over ,5
they o my give you  month to found out if anything is wrong well i just went passed my month my phone has a eco on the side of the caller so i am stuck with that dont work right never buy from this place again,1
very useful device once you put in the laptop it will work as modem  once you plug it to usb power or battery it will work as wifi router it has wifi password  highly recommended  country used  saudi arabia,5
there is some confusion about the bands and networks this should work on g att networks though it does not it only saw the forbidden g verizon and g tmobile here consider the att velocity usb stick by zte,1
didnt think id go back to a moto but ive had the phone for a few weeks thing works great battery life is incredible only complaint is i had to go to verizon store to have my sim card cut down took secs and i was out the door happy,4
motorola is always my phone of choice and this one does not disappoint the ease of use and rich bright colors are second to none the front and back cameras take clear sharp pictures that are easily shared the battery life is great this phone is a definite keeper,5
completely useless with google pop up after pop up after pop up motorola couldnt stop these pop ups and my norton security could not stop them apparently google owns motorola screw google i returned it ill never buy another motorola phone again so help me,1
i was in the usa i received the device and when i arrived here in brazil i put my chip and when i turned the device on it has white and black spots on the screen i think the problem is the screen because i have another device and this does not happen ,1
phone works great as expected fully compatible with my phone company in the caribbean picture quality is the best ive seen thus far my only complaint is that the phone i received was no rose old as i had ordered but silverrey,4
i was a bit worried my phone wouldnt work or something wrong could have happened but no after buying this product i changed my mind and i am loving my new phone recommend to buy this product if looking for a s d,5
my wife had issue with her note  and decided to surprise her with s plus on her birthday she really love the phone especially for the picture quality and clear selfie she can take with the phone its worth every bit of the price,5
el tlf lo compre por que debería de ser nuevo pero no lo es por qué tiene la batería abombada y se le despegó la tapa de atrás y lo compre para un regalo ahora me hacen pasar esa pena y lo envie a venezuela ahora que solución ustedes me dan,1
i like it but i find some improvements difficult to handle but that is because i just got it i have had different samsung for years and like them very much this one is more sophisticated and therefore takes more time to get familiar with it,4
this phone is the bomb im a samsung girl and my product came in amazing condition so imvery please withmy purchase the charger work as expected i got everything i should inthe box so far so good with this product no complain at all,5
the phone itself is great and as described but it is not an american power cord reason for the  stars if for the power plug and the fact that they did not honor the shipping two day it was a week before i received it,3
beware of these that say no warranty mine arrived with the plastic all wrinkled and missing the headphones normally i would care about not having headphones as i never use them but the screen was not responsive at all i returned it,1

i bought a samsung galaxy s  gb unlocked phone   screen  international version but when installing a different sim card it is not compatible with any network even though it is an unlocked phone with international version,1
compré el equipo y en su descripción decía smgf sin embargo al momento de abrir el paquete resultó siendo el smgfd versión duos además el equipo presenta fallas en la batería en muchas ocasiones cuando el nivel de carga baja a  el equipo se apaga,1
greatt phone i was a little scared about make the purchase of the phone but it was delivered on time and i reiceve it new just as the seller legend wireless said it is i just love my s plus exceeded my expectations and the camera is amazing,5
i dont like the fact that you have to choose between sim or a memory card i should be able to have sim sim and my memory card in my phone at the same time instead i have to settle with using sim and sim,4
i brought this phone a month ago just started using it two day ago the call quality is very poor and the battery life is also very poor i would like to return this product becuase the other party cant hear me when i talk,1
i bought and shipped to nigeria everything is exactly as described i bought it for my wife and shes been ecstatic since then everything works perfectly i also got an adapter for us sockets too although i dont need it,5
this product cost me  it was not mentioned that it was a refurbished product i am now having trouble with it and want a full refund i am unhappy with this purchase and the monies spent thinking it was a new cell phone,2
love this phone i could go for the s plus but because of the price difference and i dont see that big difference between s and s so i choose the s even if i had to choose again i will go with the s all the way great phone,5
the connector for the charger does not work at all this is horrible can i charge my phone and i buy a plug loose charger harbor horrible product completely dissatisfied you guys should be ashamed of yourselves,2
bought this for my father he needs a lot of processing speed to run his company apps and this phone has worked well for him thus far it was between this and the pixel but he may not notice a major difference between them it serves all of his needs well,5
all in all the phone was as described brand new and works like a dream i bought it for my sister who is insufferably picky about any little hiccup but no complaints from her as yet so ill take it as a good sign all in all was quite pleased with the experience,5
i bought this for my friend and she loves it since this is unlocked phone she uses this when she goes to a foreign land text were clear and could easily be read even at a low lighting highly recommend even this kind of phone is a little bit pricy,5
i love the phone but why was an british charger unit with a  prong rectangular rd prong sent instead of a standard charger i purchased the international unlocked phone in the us for my us use and my extensive travels to asia,5
the galaxy splus is the worst phone i have experienced so far i spent a huge amount of money for this phone but still the rear camera not focusing however i went through the youtube videos and other websites to solve the problem but i couldnt fix it no solution,1
i end up getting the galaxy  plus nice phone long batterylife nice screen seems like a good phone phone does have a lot of bugs hopefully they fix it soon biggest problem is a network connection bug voice to text maybe works  of the,3
i bought a s plus phone in your store through the personal shoper of myus when i reached my hands i restarted the phone and it does not recognize my sim card says it has just verizons please help me this is the my email luismoraishotmailcom,1
received this phone yesterday as a gift same model number f and have been using it with simple mobile and t mobile networks here in the united states put my sim card in and got good connections with lte no problems,5
what can i say i love this phone i works everything works no glitches responsive beautiful screen every phone i have owned has had error outs setting up apps that i had on the previous phone not one error out on this one,5
it definitely felt high quality and worth the price i only suggest that you check if your phone service provider support this phone unfortunately for me my provider doesnt so its a glorified paperweight still love it though,5
i absolutely loved this phone but i also have an scratch in my screen very sensitive screen i never had a self phone with a scratch before  i do have the screen protection but still had an scratch in the phone,5
i brought this device and thought that it should work on at network  but when i checked with at then they are saying it looks like your device is incompatible with our network visit us at a local att store for help,1
this phone is a really good alternative to the iphones of the past two years it can pretty much do anything that the iphones can do for a much more affordable price i am very happy and will continue to be a samsung customer,5
the hardware is awesome the os is awesome but the impossible to disable bixby is simply moronware designed by morons for morons why would anyone want a database to talk to them i wish i could make bixby shut up i suggest that samsung terminate bixby,4
i have not even used the phone it was taken out the box to install it was dropped on the floor during the process it is shattered on all corners and cracks all the way across the front and back of the phone,1
i got this phone through verizon and for the most part its not bad but the bixby bs is so annoying im constantly pushing the button pulling it out of my pocket and launching an app that i have no use for,3
while i loved my nexus  it fell out of support this phone is a great replacement i even convinced my coworker to buy one its a midtier phone with top tier feel and function its not a pixel or any other  phone it is a high quality mid tier phone,5
took some time before i bought the phone but it was perfect in the end great battery life great cameras great storage and ram if only it had a finger print scanner but its just as good as the galaxy s,5
i have bought it on june  now i need to change the charging port   usb charger charging port dock connector usb port flex cable  as the battery its not charging properly it takes  days to get  charge  unacceptable  very disappointed,1
ive had this phone for a few days now i used to get iphones but became annoyed at their high prices and mediocre quality i love my new sony its so easy to use the screen is wonderful the pics are amazing and the memory is unbelievable thank you so much sony,5
got this because it was unlocked what the description doesnt tell you is that this is an international model and wont work in the us i have att and still couldnt use any mobile data had to return wish the description had just been up front in the first place,1
gps lags a lot other than that as good as any other phone but better because of screen size update  months and charges slow or not at all but i got another new one this and gps lag only issues just got be smart with directions and not bed usb,5
i have this phone for  months and im absolutely love it  beautiful large phone i dont play games on my phone dont watch video calls facebook txt internet average data use charging every  days,5
think the camera was better but it is a nice phone my brother has a s i think and his camera is way more awesome than the one on this phone am still getting acquainted with the phone though maybe there are settings i need to adjust,4
very terrible battery volumeonly last  hours when you play games but the design and the screen are extremly good you can watch it all day without any uncomrfotable feelings not bad good product overall,4
of all the phones av had i like this one most because of its functionality however the phone has started to have a problem with the charging four months after purchase i have to incline the phone against a wall or hold it for it to charge,3
i like sony products a lot they are sophistication and high quality i like this model too i like the high resolution camera and its integration into the phone the display with its high aspect ratio makes for a different perspective on photography,5
a really great phone it is rather large especially when you put a case on it so dont get it if you want a petite phone that can fit in your skinny jeans lol everything about its function has been perfect,5
at about a month of use and its been outstanding lack of finger print access has been a bummer the camera is not as clear as it boasts but not bad by any means functions like a phone of twice its price range id buy it again if i broke or lost it,5
what a beautiful phonetook it to metro pcs to have it connected and they asked me where i got it said it was a very sexy phone it did have several updates but thats a great thing compared to huawei who never updated my mate  ,5
i like the phone but it has issues sometimes when i hang up the phone after a call i hear static when i turn it off it takes long to go off apart from that i like ot would like to exchange it for a different one same color though,4
edited had to take the screen protector to see if it was cracked but it really was the screen not the screen protector noticed in the sun when it was turned off not way you can notice otherwise if it was not for the angle in the sun,1
really in love with this phone massive upgrade from my galaxy s only complaint is the speaker is a little quiet but i usually have earphones on anyways so no big deal great for reading books really sleek looking and feels like a quality phone,5
i like the phones size and speed however it drops wifi signal constantly i have to restart the phone multiple times a day wish i would have done more research before i purchased it because im not the only one with this problem,1
today i received the phone but i realized that the package was opened and i couldnt find the headphone in the package the original packages supposed to be closed and full with accessories i want my headphones and i have to get them in  days,1
im very impressed and happy with this phone the screen size is great the clarity is amazing and so are the photos you take replaced an lg g and am really loving this phone very clear call reception also,5
great phone for price not missing anything awesome back camera i dont do selfies good battery life lasts all day and i am a heavy user charges quickly great for tv and movies volume not terrific but decent,5
the phone itself is ok but the amount of time it takes to charge is crazy i basically have it charging  hours a day  takes r oughly a hour i have almost tossed it out the window a few times getting a different phone next week never again will i buy a sony,1
really awsome phone works great has android oreo selfie game is  storage selfie flash usb c   price makes this one of the better phones because quality is  honestly its better than a iphone and a samsung for this price,5
i love this phone it has great and reasonable features for the price it has been over a year and still works as new and sony keeps updating the phone it gets better every time this was the best decision to buy sony xperia ultra and not spend ,5
theres no gyroscope on this phone so if you have sky map or a vr headset forget about it also theres only one small speaker on the bottom of this phone thats not very loud but all in all its not a bad of a phone,3
this phone loses wifi and bluetooth connection regularly it has been happening more regularly and now it happens daily the fix is simple as it just needs a restart and then it works again it is an annoying problem that i have not been able to fix,1
do not buy this item have had issues with it since day one bought in jan and its now may and it will not charge past   these are refurbished pos now im out  and no phone to use guess ill buy a real phone apple,1
have so many problems with the phone cant connect wifi every now and then cant receive call every now a then really weak connectivity all the time the list goes on  i wonder if i still have the factory warranty to return it,1
im giving it  stars only because for some reason its not letting me receive picture messages everytime someone sends me a picture the messaging app force closes and restarts other than that its an outstanding phone,4
i bought this phone by error because i wanted an unlocked phone im unable to use the phone so i cant give any other reviews on the specs im still trying to figure out a way to get the phone unlocked without it costing me too much,2
este equipo vino con problemas de micrófono ya que se no estaba oyendo cuando uno hablaba fue devuelto al proveedor a fines de reemplazo por uno de la misma marca pero en perfecta condiciones o de lo contrario la devolución del efectivo,2
have had this phone for about two years now had zero issues that werent at my fault if the specs arent up to your standards thats understandable but for everyone complaining about battery life screen brightness ect how about you lye off of the porn sites,4
once again this is such a great phone and the delivery was spot on thanks for the speedyness seriously this phone is most excellent its like brand new in every way not a scratch on it the camera is insanely sweet and the delivery was spot on thanks again,5
hard to believe the phone isnt brand new it has better battery endurance than my other samsung phone which is a year old so it tells me this phone was gently used there is not a blemish on it very pleased expectations exceeded,5
compré el teléfono para un regalo para un familiar y fue un verdadero desastre se bloquea constantemente no permitiendo su funcionamiento estoy decepcionada con esté producto  no pude devolverlo porque fue a otro país fue pérdida total no lo recomiendo,1
ive been using this phone for about  weeks since upgrading myself from an iphone c and i am beyond glad i switched to android not knocking ios but i definitely prefer android and the camera on this phone is gorgeous,5
first phone i received had a bad charging port charger wouldnt stay connected to the phone sent the phone back for a replacement and the replacement was shipped very quickly back to me replacement works great,5
phone came in the wrong color speakers were extremely hard to hear from and the camera would make a hissing noise and not focus sometimes however i returned it and got a new version of this phone that i love it seems like the refurbishing was poorly done,2
buyer beware phone was defective from the start couldnt catch service and when returned i was charged a  restocking fee for their defected phone maybe mine was a lemon at least i got something back,1
this was a replacement for a lost s but couldnt afford to buy a new one from verizon also didnt want another contract turns out the phone was just as fine as a new one operates fine shows no wear at all very pleased with this refurbished product,5
purchase on the th of january   now it april th  and my phone stop working wont even turn on waste of money dont even deserve a star very disappointed  but cannot post without a star so unfair,1
its a very nice phone just received it today the only thing i am not satisfied about is the battery  i took an hour nap and left it charging and it was at  and now i havent even used it for an hour and its already on  ,4
ill wait  or  weeks and depend on how it works ill upgrade the review the phone did not came in his original box and there is no audiophone i am not totally satisfied update its a really good phone,4
good phone especially at  ill keep my eye out for another one at that price the nano coating for water resistance makes it very smooth and thus a little slippery when holding in ones hand i recommend getting a case so you can grip it,5
i never did anything to it i just opened it and tried to charge it didnt work flickering on and off called customer service and they werent much help asked for a replacement they sent the broken phone back to me instead of a replacement phone,1
i bought it to give to my mother and it was an excellent purchase it has android a good camera since it was acquired it has received multiple updates it has flash in both cameras it takes good selfies after more than  year it keeps working perfect,5
great price for the phone unfortunately the listing is very incomplete did not know it was locked to verizon also this phone does not have gsm bands so you will not be able to use it on tmobile att or project fi,3
 theres a lot of bad comments and maybe they really had a bad experience with the phone but guy if you want something  percent guaranteed go to an apple store im astonished with my iphone i think i was lucky you may have same luck,5
the product is okay i paid for  days shipping and it took  to  days to arrive the home screen button is not working property the battery drains like crazy i already took the phone outside of country otherwise i would definitely ask for exchange or refunds,2
phone looked perfect but every few calls it sounded like there was background wind noise in the end i brought it to the apple store and they told me the microphone was failing my only option was to trade it in for  i wouldnt buy from this company again,1
cheap clean android and fast i gave this as a gift to my mom who had an old microsoft phone before she left her new samsung phone and chose this instead this phone is much faster because of the clean android it has battery lasts long enuf for her,5
dolby speakers stopped working  weeks after started using it a week after that phone froze and when the battery got drained it never turned back on dont waste your money nokia is not what it used to be,1
so far i am experiencing great problems with one of these phones which i am very displeased about not even a month old and i it have been over heating and the key pad is not responding so disappointing i need this to be rectify asap,2
the phone did not last  months started having battery problems after a month required the phone to be restarted everytime a charger was plugged in i purchased  nokia  phones and had the same issue on both the devices does anyone know how can i get my money back,1
i think overall a good purchase for the price speaker phone a little disappointing but on the other hand the speakers produce good sound for media probably the separation for dolby acheived and i like the camera and video quality,4
i like the picture quality i like the sleek design as well as the speed of the operating system updating my review my nokia starting to give me issues as it doesnt want to accept a charge anymore lowering from a  star to  ,4
i ordered this phone not expecting much since it was so reasonably priced when i opened it  it was a really great looking phone sadly i returned it only because my friend gave me their old phone for free  so i cannot comment on anything other than the look,5
sleek no bloatware and ive dropped it twice no case and its still in perfect condition nokia may have been bought out but this product is an excellent use of their brand i got the noads version,5
great phone if you dont mind having no signal and tons of dropped calls the manual says to be careful not to cover the antenna while using but it doesnt tell you where the antenna is im sorry i bought this it was a total waste of money,1
exactly what i was looking for my old phone didnt hold a charge for half a day this can easily last over a day of normal usage the screen is very readable outside and has a pretty decent camera for the price this is definitely worth it,4
unfortunately this phone is not compatible with my kia soul i have worked with nokia and kia to resolve this and nothing has worked also unfortunately i waited past the  days to try to return it my advice is to make sure you test everything when you get a phone,1
the product nokia  phone is well built and its android os g is sufficient for my needs nokia was my first cell phone in  when i still lived in europe i have used siemens and samsung but ive always preferred nokia glad to see it back on the market,4
had this phone for less than a year and it has had intermittent problems since after the first month dropped calls  no signal and now for the last month the sound just quits working randomly not happy at all,1
great phone i get no lag and enjoy the latest android operating system very good build quality awesome phone experience coming from windows phones fans of windows phones will appreciate the nokia  features and signature build quality,5
after  months microphone went out then the screeni have to bend the phone for the screen to come onmy old low range nokia smart phone lasted way longer than this still working actuallycheaper too,1
love this phone its very sturdy so far with just a basic case on the outside im notoriously clumsy and so far only have one tiny barely noticeable scratch after  months of use battery still lasts about  hours of active usage,4
picture quality is poor screen cracked after just a week of use with minimum impact fall it literally fell on another phone on a carpet iphone  which was intact and cracked still puzzled as i have used phones that have survived many worse falls wont recommend,1
i bought this phone in may of this year it is now december and the entirety of my screen has come detached from the phone the battery life is poor and anytime my phone has to restart it deletes all the fingerprints that were stored off of my phone,2
new system updates improved the camera bit originally skin color used to be yellowish  now its close to natural i still dont like the fact that the glass gets fingerprints a lot one need to clean the glass frequently bit disappointing,4
i love this phone ive had it for almost a year now excellent mid range phone large apps sometimes run slow if they need to connect to a server my only one gripe is that it doesnt have a micro sd slot if it had id be over the moon,5
i only bought this phone about a month ago and it just went off on its on and will not come back on for  days now this phone is not worth it at all persons should think twice before purchasing this phone am wondering how can i get my money back,1
the phone is awesome just a few things i didnt like the camera is not as great the picture quality is poor in a dark room i liked the sound quality and the ram and rom are a okey for that price the best thing is the fact that it was unlocked,4
the build quality seems great and the performance is good especially for the price however this is the us version not a global version but it does not have a notification led the model i got from amazon is ta ds and the notification led is missing,3
plenty of problems with it its slow  low memory old processor text messages often wont download visual voicemail stopped working the phone looks great but after  months im already looking for a new one,1
when your on a phone call the data turns off the flash light in the back is mixed with white and orange the picture comes out orange i noticed it laggs at times other than that it provides g but i encountered call drops at times,2
a great budget phone i got it in blue without the ads and so far so good just pop my old sim card in and i was ready to go it has very nice camera quality a large screen lightweight and a very sleek design would definitely recommend,5
was only able to ever get g in a major city poor call quality and barely had any signal in my house on a tmobilemetropcs network also battery doesnt last very long and takes a long time to charge great customer service by the seller though,2
the phone has many faults didnt have it for a month yet  the imperfections arose the phone would go off randomly messages are not being delivered picture messages dont send accurately  so much more,1
i have had this phone for a year and a half it lasts the earbuds did not work but i have used this for many things and it functions well for the price range usually i switch phones this one is a workhorse has good storage,5
cant root the device cant install twrp cant install a custom rom cant remove security risks and spyware nokia has locked their bootloader and their official method of unlocking the bootloader only works on their newer phones so this one is useless,1
i bought this in february  it randomly restarts itself at least  times a day it gets really hot while charging on the charger it came with dont waste your money you are better off with a flip phone rather than this garbage,1
wow so surprised at how great this phone is for the price super responsive great camera features no bloated extra apps easy setup and simple transfer from old phone buy this phone if you need an upgrade and dont want to spend  dollars for a phone,5
i love this phone i purchased the silver one without the adds it has plenty of storage and all the ram i need it works very well and is very well made i have only had it about a week but i use it heavily everyday i have given it  stars because it works so well,5
i had previously owned a nokia  but gave it to my brother which he enjoys to this day was gifted a blu phone as a transitional device and it was god awful in almost every quality so i ordered another   fantastic,5
my phone is dual sim but the tray was wrong apparently nokia made mistake constructing some number of phones and placed single sim tray into twosim phone had to contact their support for repairreplacement,4
the advertisement states that the phone is dual sim i received a single sim phone i have tried to resolve this issue as i bought two of them and they are both single sim phones i need resolution for this situation,2
i love this phone it feels slick and solid in your hand while it is not the most powerful android device it is well made and being pure android definitely improves performance considering the price as well it is more powerful than it may seem on paper,4
after oreo update phone worked for a day and froze never to boot again i could not even get to recovery mode to do a factory reset before returning pathetic i am still giving nokia one more chance and if the replacement fails too that is it nokia never again,1
i think its a great phone and i like the simplicity of operation but my amazon app is totally in chinese ive tried to change the language to english but to no avail its frustrating to have an app that you cant use or take off the phone,4
i am writing this review after using the phone for three weeks the phone is very responsive nokia made this in a reasonable price its very worthy for the  i recommend this phone for sure if anyone looking to buy the phone around this price,5
i purchased this phone for a friend from the get go it wouldnt hold any charge she had to resort to using her old phone which gives tons of trouble only reason i cant return it is because its not in the countrytrust me dont waste ur hard earn money on this,1
rarely charged over  dropped  when rebooted after  weeks usb charging wires stopped working altogether didnt get it returned in time had it boxed but never mailed it just unhappy and stuck better luck to you ,1
i got this phone used and its in a brand new condition except for a minor scuff on screen barely noticeable though so im extremely happy for what i paid for packaging could have been a little better but all in all good deal,4
new perfect condition the phone might not have arrived in the providers or manufacturers packaging but the phone arrived in perfectly new condition not a scratch after a week of use its still acting like a brand new phone very happy with this item,5
phone quit working screen after one month could not be repaired no response from seller would not consider product from this seller nor would i ever purchase anything without some type of warranty purchase at your own risk,1
the phone works perfectly i had my worries because it is used but i do not regret this purchase at all the phone has minor dents and scratches on the top and bottom which is why i gave it  stars but they are not noticeable with a case feels brand new,4
battery decrease too fast  hours used when its fully charged cant use it for a day i just can take photo or stuff only for  hours and thats it i lost my money with bad phone its sometimes auto work auto open one page to other page which i am not doing,1
better than my old unlocked j prime as wifi calling works and was a better price almost perfect save for a small chip in the power button about the size of a needlepoint works well and cosmetically is nearly perfect low price and functional so im happy,4
adequate feel nice heft processors still sluggish for the few apps that i have installed samsung wants to vacuum all of your data with their apps that requires more access than needed what else is new,3
the phone freezes when i try to accept incoming calls everything else works fine but its a pretty big feature to be missing i mean isnt a phone suppose to take calls anyway i would think twice before buying from this seller,2
why spend  for the new tech when this old tech has everything you need amazing camera quality awesome display great touch screen very durable and reliable i will keep buying this phone for as long as i can,5
i bought this phone for my mom in africa but she couldnt use it because the  or g they said this phone had couldnt hold i guess the g is only available to att customers who use this phone only in the us,1
phone worked for a few hours and then the screen continuously flashed on and off hadnt had the phone for  hours before it started malfunctioning phone would not even factory reset to remove all my information that was set up on the phone,1
this phone is an ok phone but does not stay connected to the internet one has to constantly disconnect and reconnect in order to check emails view a video on youtube or anything else requiring internet connection for this reason i give it a ,2
the samsung j android cellphone definitely met my high expectations my sister had one and raved about it so of course i had to have one too it is reliable easy to use and i dont have to charge it every day its great for people like me who are not high tech,5
this is the rd j i have purchased here on amazonthis one looks like it was not necessarily new  coulda maybe been a refurbas it came with a screen protector on itand sometimes it does some odd functionsanywayits fine until the next one,2
came quickly this is an unlocked att phone so it has their logo on start up i transferred my tracfone account which was easy to do off the website after dumping all the att bloatware it operates as a samsung phone with a  gig card it is a mini tablet,5
know that this phone will not allow wifi calling for tmobile users it is an att phone and does not have the tmobile software needed to allow wifi calling we have poor cell reception inside our home and use the feature to fill the gap so it is disappointing,3
thank you for having a samsung at an affordable price i love that it is unlocked so i do not have to commit to one communication network my brother loves his new phone it is an upgrade from his blu phone,5
the phone is in excellent condition but it doesnt come with earphonesthats okthe touch pad is a little unsensitiveneed to double tapbeautiful picsbeautiful camera resultssound quality excellentshipping was timelyall good,5
this phone was not properly unlocked i called support from my carrier and from samsung and both said there is a software issue preventing the phone from properly registering to the carrier for mobile data find another seller,1
i was psyched about this phone and the one they sent looks cosmetically fine unfortunately its completely broken and unusable freezes resets again and again and when it does turn on i get error message after error message ill be returning it,1
this phone was not unlocked like they claimed it was still had verizon apps installed started malfunctioning from the start and after  months couldnt make or recive calls the seller wouldnt let me return it,1
phone app in phone used to make all phone calls stopped working properly  days after purchase if it had broken just a week earlier it could have used the warranty to fix now i have to spend almost  again on another phone,1
weve had limited success with refurbished st gen pixels out of six phones four had or soon developed serious battery drain instantly dropping charge by  or more one phone arrived with a dead battery and wouldnt hold a charge,3
bought this phone and it had audio issues after going through google support discovered it is a hardware defective phone sent it back and they charged me a restocking fee of  what a scam do not buy unless you want to loose  of your money and all your time,1
i was sent a verizon unit and as such did not have access to the bootloader the title of this item gsm unlocked was misleading if youre looking for a true unlocked phone you need the google unit google pixel,1
zero stars definitely not refurbished mine had a passcode from previous owner and couldnt unlock when returning the phone i had to pay return shipping wasted a whole day trying to unlock and then having to pay shipping is complete bs,1
i got this phone today overall i was so excited upon opening it i flipped it over took off the screen plastic to reveal a deep scratch in the center of the screen bummed every other part of the phone is cosmetically great,4
this is one of my worst purchase in amazon this phone worked fine for about  months after that lot of functionality stopped working mic completely stopped working and this phine is of no use and dailysales doesnt help you at all,1
so my phone just stopped charging this morning just a few days after production support ended it feels deceptive when it was working it was fine it just wont charge and will soon be out of juice tried two cables and two chargers,2
the phone is indistinguishable from a new phone no residual data no cosmetic blemishes and everything seems to function properly it arrived when it was scheduled to arrive and it includes a perfectly serviceable charger and cable whats not to love,5
im not sure to what extent they refurbish these phones weve bought  of them and only one has worked so if you dont mind returning the phone a few times in order to get one that works go for it the one i got that actually works is a pretty awesome phone,1
love this phone had the issue that is more common than google wants to admit cracked solder in the connection to the audio components if you buy this know that the motherboard will need to be replaced,1
good phone while it lasted but it only worked  months until the mic phone app in general and videos stopped working factory reset didnt fix all the google employee could do was tell me that it was not under warranty so they wouldnt help,2
the phone is excellent but the battery life is pretty bad on this refurbished phone i love the idea of recycling electronics but without a decent battery this phone is really hard to use  lasts about  hours with normal usage,2
product lasted  months phones would freeze whenever any function that attempted to use the microphone couldnt be used to make phone calls or video chat worked well till this hardwaresoftware issue arose couldnt recommend product in good conscience,2
i had to give up after returning  phones the price it great but not worth it if the phone does not work st phone had a non working microphone the replacement for that phone had battery issuesreturned both and decided to get a phone from another seller,1
so much better than our last ones the camera is just as amazing as they say it is the only qualm we have is that since they are refurbished they are a little slow and glitchy but it doesnt really get in the way at all,4
 months after receiving the device it stopped working correctly users could no longer hear or speak to callers all sound stopped functioning and no videos will play i would not recommend purchasing this device,1
i loved this phoneexcept out of the box the fingerprint scanner didnt work and within a few months of use it was already having troubles with the screen and battery i would get the phone again for sure just not refurbished from amazon,2

this was purchased to replace an ailing x mini so the size difference is definitely something to get used to i havent had any problems with this so nothing bad to report i know its not the latest and greatest but function is more important to me than shiny,5

i got this for my wife after her samsung crashed and burned she loves it feels like the moto z droid which is what i have overall very impressed with the processing power and especially the disk size great phone highly recommend,5
i could not be happier the battery life of course but also the fingerprint scanner you can also use the sensor to move between screens and remove the onscreen image navigation icons screen quality is good and the camera is adequate,5
my older motorola e nd ed could no longer handle all the apps id loaded so i was looking for another inexpensive replacement this phone is more than adequate for my needs i especially like the long lasting battery,5

dude walked into verizon and guy installed the sim in minutes i was gone with the wife happy no  upgrade fee only sales tax on  not insane bull crap value i will never buy a phone from verizon again,5
the info for this motophone says it is unlocked and verizon compatible however after purchasing it and taking it to a verizon store for a sim card they said it was locked and not a verizon compatible phone,1
a good phone except  no monthly security patches my latest was  months ago  the bootloader cannot be unlocked allegedly  i havent tried otherwise you could install a maintained os like lineage,3
have had this phone for a week so far it was fully unlocked we connected to metro pcs was in very good physical and working condition no scratches etc included a charger my daughter loves it and has not had any problems with it hopefully she wont,5

i am very surprised at this product for being a refurbished product it looks great minuscule scratch no functionality problems at all battery last just over a day with use all in all i would definitely by from this seller again,5
did have scratches on it but works great other than battery a little low update literally  days after my return window closes it starts acting up touchscreen sensor doesnt work on the lower half of the screen and it freezes to where i have to restart it so bummed,2
quick delivery and phone arrived as described as the description says its is refurbished but there was absolutely minimal wear the battery is doing fine which was one of my fears because they seem to start dying more quickly as they age over all a good buy,5
i took a risk ordering a iphone  refurbished phone from icertified to tell you the truth it looks brand new the screen clean it works well and i will definitely recommend this company for anyone thats interested in a refurbished phone,5
i bought this for my friend because her phone broke and i have bought refurbished phones before and i was very happy about this one worked perfectly no problems thus far and i have had it for about a month now,5
very very nice phone definately recoomend looked exactly like how it would have looked at an apple store so happy with this purchase the bad reviews were probably just a bad one but mine was beautiful had no scuffs or marks at all,5
ive had this phone since last year and ive had no problems with it i refuse to update the software though for fear of battery life loss otherwise works perfectly full charge lasts until night camera works perfectly and the phone itself is fast and responsive,5
the call quality is very very poor you can hear the person on the other end fine but the person only hear you in patches the picture quality is also very poor this was a really poor refurbished job and wasnt worth the price i paid for it,1
extremely impressed with the speed of delivery excellent condition absolutely no scratches or blemishes the phone works flawlessly the same quality as if you went to the apple store and got it off the shelf,5
i bought this phone  five months ago and the phone started losing service and after a week would not connect to service at all after  days the vendor will not do anything total waste of money would rank this product a zero if i could,1
it was fully unlocked as advertised it wasnt compatible with the service i was using but planned on switching providers anyways so i was totally satisfied had no scratches or dents and it shipped fast i most definitely will be a repeat customer,5
phone works great i read the reviews after i purchased and saw it might not work w verizon and got nervous i tried to cancel the order but it was too late very happy i couldnt cancel the phone works w verizon and works great in general,5
this phone seemed fine when i purchased it but time past by and the phone started messing up by not wanting to update bad batteryand very glitch now i have to purchase a new phone because this one only lasted me not even  months,1
phone was advertised as reconditioned unlocked i had sprint service and it would not work even after replacing the sim card had to go with att besides the small hiccup phone is a great value and works as expected,4
product arrived quickly and as advertised  weeks out and the phone is working great very happy with my purchase minor scratches on bottom and tip of phone but case covers it would recommend buying from this seller,4
so far i am very happy with this phone the battery life is double of the s and since it was unlocked i just switched the sim cards and transferred everything from one phone to the other in minutes fantastic,5
came without a single scratch started right up after a charge and after i popped my sim card in everything worked perfectly battery dies a little quick but i am constantly dependent on my phone for work and personal life,5
on the description it says it is a gb phone but it only has gb also when i first got the phone it said it was compatible with sprint but it wasnt my entire family had to switch over to tmobile i do not recommend buying from this company,1
the phone came in mint condition basically brand new i popped my sim in and it immediately was able to make calls and text ive read other comments saying it doesnt work for their carrier but for tmobile it does great price great phone,5
so far the phone works great all features are working amazing it even worked with my cellphone carrier cricket there was not a single scratch or dent on the phone which was  worth the money i paid,5
so far this phone is awesome great price for right now and arrived with no flaws at all it does come with a weird charger not apple but it gets the job done very happy so far if anything changes i will update this post,5
you couldnt replace my amazon gift card for me so i could actually not get this phone to my husband whos working on an oil rig in the middle of the gulf of mexico so you will definitely never get my business anymore either,5
after  moth when the warranty gone the phone is not working properly any more many issues with volume control when is on call and video call doesnt work constantly getting freezes and much more issues i highly not recommend it,1
we did have to buy a new sim from sprint but it does work i recommend you take the phone into a sprint shop and have them set it up we werent able to enable it with the online tools and a spare sim card,5
one of the two phones ordered had a blemished case one was received with a dead battery one of the chargers head was scratched also there was no usb type a to usb type c cable and no sim removal tool otherwise mainly as expected,4
i love my google phones ive had every model since they started along the way ive had other phones too but the simplicity of a phone made for android and a version of android made for the phone is really hard to beat,5
its first time to buy renewed product arrived with simple package with charger and cable theres no big scratch charging port is little bit worn but other than that it is very good condition im very satisfied with this purchase,5
battery life came at  and in the description it says they only sell phones at over  battery life the battery sucks and keeps dying at  i just got this phone a few days ago and i will be returning it,2
i love everything about my iphone s im so happy couldnt have chosen another seller to purchase from other than buyspry will definitely be purchasing from you guys again best birthday present thank you all so much,5
originally i wrote a bad review because the cell phone had an issue with the lcd screen well the supplier sent me another one for free and even told me to keep the other one because i had it fixed so i actually got two awesome customer service,5
this phone will not stay charged long enough to be useful we tried a variety of cableschargers including the original and replaced the battery it would show  charged then be down to  bar in less than a day with no active usage,1
this is my th refurbished phone purchased on amazon i have had problems with text messages being blocked only on the iphone  ive worked with my carrier trying to reset everything and have come to the conclusion that somehow the original carrier is linked,4
this was my first smartphone from a gusto flip phone this j galaxy eclipse is so easy to use samsung shows you how to use it i havent upgraded this phone i suggest buy a cover for it treat this phone like your car with extra care,4
bought this phone in april having to buy a new phone today from this first this phone has not worked if you dig into the system it says is is configured for uae not the us seller should be not be selling on amazon,1
absolutely terrific phone great camera quality great runtime great battery great everything love love love it apparently the seller of this phone bought these in singapore and you willl not be able to use your us warranty that comes with the phone,5
came here to say that i am more than disappointed with whoever the retard was that decided a wide angle selfie lense was the way to go there is a reason you dont photograph portraits with mm other than this brainless decision no complaints so far good phone,5
fantastic phone with some pretty incredible speed for playing games lots of features that make it well worth having good size not too big or to small love the sony brand and all that they do for electronics and this is no exception,5
this is a really good phone alot of improvements over my old z does not overheat like the z did battery is not the largest but efficient i like the bezels for usability also it has an actual mm headphone jack vs the newer models,5
worked for two weeks will not turn on this morning it seems the start button is sticking and charging cord has to be very carefully attached to charge  company is great to work with ups picking this one up monday sending a replacement,4
another great phone from sony amazing hdr display quality with hign end camera love the fact it is already running on android o sony really stepped its game on launching latest android releases love the d creator app and the super slow motion video capture,5
ive owned this phone for roughly a year and everything on it works great except for the call volume it is terrible and unfortunately motorola knows this is an issue and has done nothing about it this will likely be my last motorola,3
this is almost the perfect midrange phone perfect size perfect price feels high quality its fast and has a great battery life but it has one fatal flaw that might be a deal breaker for many theres no notification led,4
battery doesnt last as long as my previous moto phone but its not bad size and weight of phone feels good in my hands had replaced my moto with an iphone didnt really like it so returned for another moto good phone for the money,5
i love the phone its actually my first smartphone its taking a while to get used to it what sucks is  days after i got it it dropped  bucks in price oh well glad i got the  gb buy it while its on sell,5
would be a  star if it didnt constantly drop wifi after internet research this seems to be a common problem with this model it did not come up under any reviews but google moto x wifi issues and there it is would not purchase another,2
great phone at a great price gb and has a spot for up to tb micro card for storage cant move apps over to it but music and pictures camera works great have like  apps in and it has only used gb of storage,5
the camera on this phone is horrible unusable i had a moto g before with a great camera also there is no motorola gallery anymore so you are forced to use google photos or download some random gallery app,1
i had a motorola product years ago and was not sure what i was getting into after owning several samsungs im pleasantly surprised this product does everything i need just as well or better and looks great too,5
as said the phone operates well and has a decent feature set the reason for a  rating is the battery life its a bit shorter than i would have liked in a new phone and not as long as stated i think i have to recharge every two days and i dont use it that much,4
beware that nonunlocked phone is prefilled with all sort of bloatware that tries to subscribe you to something also att version doesnt come with android updates the last update was from aug  my older moto z has android  and updates are coming regularly,1
i bought this item thinking it is dual sim as advertised but i received a single sim and not the dual sim model unfortunately im not able to return it because i shipped it out of us very disappointed,1
when i received the phone i turned it on and the att logo came on then set phone up and it had all the bloatware from att the description said factory unlocked and this was a carrier unlocked phone huge difference,1
i just received the phone sooner than expected and well packaged everything is inside the box i turned it on to see that it works fine but i haven configure it yet as is for my cousin but all the instructions provided are pretty straightforward,5
i have not learned all the features yet but this is the best phone i have ever owned the camera is the best especially when paring with my samsung tvs the music side is outstanding and dont for get the note and the pen,5
i am enjoying the phone but the cover did not fit and the charger did not work otherwise      i havent bought a phone in at least  years so i was really looking forward to getting this one i was a bit disappointed,3
just upgraded my phone from the s plus the camera is a big step forward and my apps seem to open faster probably because of the extra ram ive been an iphone user since the first one came up and the note  is the phone i was waiting for to switch to android,5
bought this phone from breed company it doesnt work with sprint mobile sprint needs to be a cdma card reader support other than that have not been able to use the phone so i cant really rate it at this time so ill just post  stars on all these questions,1
im using it for myself as a regular phone but i did not receive everything that i was suppose to get didnt get ear pods no ejected pin no tweezers and pen nib just wanted to know why thank you neddie panko,5
phone works fine but cant really do much when the phone itself is from att i was expecting a factory unlocked phone so i can easily activate it with another carrier did not work due to the fact that it is from att,1
i love how this item came faster than the expected date also packaging was excellent phone packaging was presentable on the outside as well on the inside everything expected was included as well extremely satisfied with my new phone,5
i got the note  on prime day at a wonderful price but it didnt work on verizon despite the fact that it said it worked on us carriers my husband and i spent hours on the phone with customer servicethe thing i could do was return it very disappointing experience,1
i ordered the unlocked version and realized it was a european version junk unless im on wifi or right next to a tower the network reception is junk only  of the  bands work with att on this version of the phone dont buy here,2
yikes gifted this to my son truly shocked that package containing phone had clearly been opened as well as brochure with instructions was missing son was unwilling to return as he was in need of phone buyer beware,1
i bought this phone and i am horrified with it i dropped it and now for about  months i can not make the volume up when i am using the phone i can not hear the person  it is so low can someone get back to me to see if it can be fixed i am so upset,1
absolute amazing phone by far the best phone i have ever owned had the note  and loved it and then had the iphone s olus never going back to apple and so refreshing to have a note again battery lasts me all day and the screen is unreal,5
amazing phone amazing the only complaint are peoples complaints its too big or they can hear me because i have a bad habit of taking away from the mic i had this phone for  months and i think im gonna make it offical and marry it,5
after only owning iphones i needed to upgradei did not like what apple was offering so i decided to take a chance and go with the note i am very happy for the switch as this phone is superior to the iphone  or x,5
i had preordered the moto z force and had it for about  months and then screen peeled off plus it was glitch the whole time talked to verizon and started a payment plan on this phone i absolutely love it no comparison its fast gorgeous and has a great camera,5
good features but all the adhesive makes it almost impossible to open the phone to replace the battery when the battery life starts to go unfortunate such an expensive piece of technology will become obsolete when the battery stops holding a charge,2
dissapointing samsung blew it on this one the phone is too long too skinny and breaks to easily i was looking forward to upgrading my note  to note  once i saw the note  i decided to stick with the  hopefully samsung makes a better note ,2
i purched a note  from samsung they offered a trade in of  for old se i sighned up they said trade in over and balance  i got phone it was slow and didnt want to unlock so i returned on  still waiting for a refund of ,2
rock solid phone best camera and excellent build quality and performance right out of the box battery is a weakest link in this phone  with heavy usage emails reading web documents barely lives whole day,4
great phone using in  and it works great handles  web pages  dozens of apps without much trouble stylus is excellent and replacements can be found on amazon for under  very good phone and comperable to current models,5
i purchased this phone a few months ago it has performed better than expected and i definitely get a lot of use out of the spen also the blurred background effect is a must now for me i use it the camera effect on a regular basis,5
i am new to the note family and the spen takes a bit of time to get used to having said that the spen is an extremely useful tool the voicetotext or voice input feature saves a decent amount of time who wants to type anyway samsung has done it again,5
product said it would work on straight talk verizon towers it only pairs with a t t towers couldnt setup voicemail at all even with installed att sim just traded for a google pixel with no limit to verizon service,2
its the only phone with a pressuresensitive stylus so really your only cheaper options are older notes which dont have security updates if youre an artist then this phone is great for drawing on the go or in your bed,5
this phone is just great the gb of ram makes it incredibly fast the reason for the  stars is the uncertainty of not knowing if im affected by the battery bug but battery life even at full performance mode is awesome,4
best phone ive ever owned the battery life sucks though i barely use the pen wish the screen was a bit wider i am coming g from a phab pro and love the size of the screen but im getting used to this so far,5
its about what i expected but it still feels overpriced i have big hands and the stylus is tiny so i wont be using it much on the bright side the screen is lovely but the curved edges feel like a distracting gimmick,3
was debating whether to switch to iphone or not so glad i didnt good sized workable screen stunning photos and instinctive featuresimpressive responsiveness from os havent tried it but also able to facetime,5
when amazon list their phones that are traded in or are used and are being resold there under grading their phones from a plus to the phone actually being good phone by it being used dug a good phone set back and returned last of aday after,1
brilliant phone the large screen is usable as the bezzles are almost nonexistant phenomenal camera battery life is fine if you lower the resolution when you know you will have a long day watch mkbhds review on youtube to get the full jist,5
good but very delicate camera battery life speed features resolution all excellent fell approximately  foot to tile floor screen shattered fyi  to replace at best buy  to ship to samsung if no insurance still hurts,3
im not one to give  stars out to any phone ive had in the past but this phone gets the highest rating excellent camera hi def video great storage more power faster more efficient  just tons of features go for it,5
wanted small tablet i can travel with to read or watch a movie during lay overs that has not onky wifi but cellular also thus tablet is perfect fit easily in my purse and it looks brand new set up was fast delivered  days ahead of schedule,5
does not except sim card from tmobile with hot spot very very much disappointed about this i bought this tablet simply because everything i read about this tablet indicated it would accept tmobile sims card with hot spot,1
i had one of these but i had to replace because i could not unlock the other one this tablet is way slower than the other one i had and they are literally the same type honestly i wish i could get my money back it takes forever to respond,1
had tab e for my son and bought this for my daughter primarily as a video player the default video player is not user friendly it only shows  sec thumbnails and does not display the name i had to i stall third party vlc other than that im happy,5
this phone works great on ting which is what i bought it for it has text messaging and three games included theres no camera or web browser which is fine by me the phone calls sound loud and i havent received any complaints about how i sound,4
will not receive group texts wouldnt be a problem if it at least told me who tried to send the message instead i just get message cannot be displayed from an unknown digit  everything else works fine,3
i bought two of these product to send my parents abroad and one of them was used when my parents received their phone it was locked by a previous owner they hadnt been able to use it because as soon as they turn it on it request for the unlock code,1
the phone is an oldschool nokia  yes it has snake  but the functionality is not good and calls are impossible during all calls the callers voice drops and then comes back this is not the call dropping not worth the pennies,1
señores a la fecha no he recibido el pedido comprado un teléfono nokia he realizado seguimiento y ha sido infructuoso por lo tanto requiero me sea devuelto el dinero ya que actualmente retorne a mi país venezuela agradezco su atención,1
very good phone i had the nokia  rm this is the    model has a larger display screen  is better built new design  speaker for the speaker phone is in the front the old version has it in the back,5
i bought  of this phone for my family members in nigeria and it was supposed to be unlocked world gsm as advertised but it does not work with any service provider in nigeria do not buy for international use its junk,1
i love it even if its not as durable as the old one is simple for senior people is a great gift but the only problem i have is i wish they made a bigger model with big buttons and a large display for seniors,3
i liked the overall feel of this phone and the basicness of it but i could not figure out how to receive group messages or pictures i tried everything possible but perhaps it is not fully compatible with cricket wireless,3
if you are looking for a phone with no webinternetnetwork capability this is as close as you will probably find it does have a web browser but there is no wifi connectivity so as long as you do not have data on your service plan there is no internet,5
light not as user friendly as my old  when i try to open contacts it keeps spinning saying working on it i was just guessing  days working on it should be enough time cant escape or get the spinning to stop problem,3
the reception on the tmobile network isnt great and often times you can hear the other person talking but they cant hear you or vice versa very little memory so you have to delete texts and calendar regularly,3
this phone is reminiscent of my original  i havent explored all the features but it does appear to be compatible with most networks and in many countries it has a camera which the original  never had,5
the two main buttons have multiple functions which is very confusing for my elderly mother inlaw i dont recommend it for an older person she gets super frustrated when the buttons dont do what she expects,3
this phone was a total waste of money for my case it wasnt advertised that it only supports very few languages even software updates or language packages are not available on their website customer service couldnt be of any help,1
i bought it couple months ago when i start using it i found out the phone does not ring when someone calls most the calls i made dropped i m still in shock i didnt expect nokia to make a phone that bad,1
i love the size and the physical number buttons phone was easy enough to figure out there are limited functions and one that i miss is the option to increase the font size otherwise the phone works great as a basic cell phone to answer and make phone calls,4
they show the picture with two simm cards but this set has only one simm slot i return this item and stated the reason that i need with two simm and reorder to my horror i received the phone with one simm,1
i am very happy with my nokia  g the size and ergonomic shape and is very comfortable in my hand i was worried that i would miss my smartphone but i dont with nav and music in the car i dont need it and i certainly dont need the distraction,5
what can i say this cellphone is fantastic the screen is bright with no problem in direct sunlight the battery life is great i recharge it  time per week audio quality is great and the speaker volume is very loud i am so happy i tossed the smartphone,5
there is only one problem with the phone it is a g and the phone gets no service in a lot of places t mobil said they are updated to g so after awhile it wont pick up services hopefully nokia will go up to g,3
the phone works alright but i was disappointed i didnt receive the color phone i wanted so even though the phone works my overall experience was a let down and brought the score down to  im embarrassed to walk around with this bright orange color,1
phone looks and works fine no visible wear on it but it seems like its an open box model the packaging was slightly damaged and the charger and such had visible sings of wear a little annoying when expecting something new and unused,3
doesnt work on tmobile as advertised i had to buy att sim fell once from hand and broke cant easily control volume of alarm and ringtone not worth the price battery life is good and thats the only positive point,3
using tmobile poor reception in the same spot comparing between the phone and another brand phone this one would not get any bars main need for a phone to make and receive calls this fails as it has poor reception,1
overpriced for what it is yeah there is snake but its not like the classic snake the app store is there but apps are unable to connect to data no matter what i try to do not really worth  dollars more like ,2
basic phone use it for my second device that is just for otps roaming messages works perfectly and i dont have to worry about charging it everyday i received a charging cable that wasnt working properly but amazon assistants helped me out with that,4
bluetooth is completely unusable because it still uses password to pair music takes forever to load before it plays anything there are adwares that need you to pay money to use them and no you can not remove them,2
a very sturdy device simple to use on g and g network only i placed my t mobile simcard inside and no connection it does tell me i have voice message in the mailbox but it can not call out or receive call from tmobile network,3
nice phone bought for my godmother screen came scratched no time to send it back for a new one very light not sure if it works correct until she gets a sim card in it but it looks very nice took a pic of scratch screen bummer,3
junk after  months three lines appeared across the top of the display and would not go away nokia tech support were useless and amazon wouldnt accept the return dont waste your money on an inferior product that the manufacturer and retailer wont stand behind,1
there is serious issue with this phone it comes with many preinstalled demo games that cant be removed contacted nokia support and the answer is that it is impossible to remove in sum it is a really stupid product design,1
well needed a quick phone till mine is fixed long battery lifedecent call volume way too many games cant even use the internettwitterfacebook app is useless no predictive textthe snake game isnt the original its unnecessarily modern,3
only gave it a four star since i havent used it yet to know how the battery last this phone is light and looks great its like going back to year  again so far i like it and im getting some attention to those people who knows nokia  from back in the days,5
i love this little dummyphone the standby times bananas the handlings fantastic even though the software could be more intuitive but its made to do  things maketake phone calls and texts and for that it works perfect,5
phone worked in seconds after i installed the sim card comes with charger and ear phones looks way cooler than my new iphone and works better too i bet battery will last a lot longer not great for apps i guess im not even going to try i feel lighter already,5
this unit as listed does not support and is not supported by att we purchased this for an elderly parent and the time trouble and effort trying to get this thing to function thru att is painful the att system willl not support this phone dont bother trying,1
first phone the powerend button stopped working in about a month and a half replacement had its screen go fullbright but not display anything after about a month complete and utter garbage useless phones do not purchase,1
i wanted an unsmart phone that would fit in my pocket i had an old nokia that was similar but i broke the screen i ordered this phone and it does everything my old phone did but it is louder so it is easier to hear easy to use,5
smartphone detox doesnt even have wifi works great on tmobile excellent call quality battery lasts for days and days there is an opera based browser for emergencies dont worry its too frustrating to let you get in trouble ,5
got this for my  dad great but bluetooth doesnt work on his truck or the three headsets i tried i was able to pair them but it kicked off the device after about  seconds each time it connects returning this phone,2
nokia used to make good phones but not this one with the small  gb internal storage and i expanded with  gb sd card the apps got stopped often when making phone calls the screen always turned black so you cant control the calling anymore very bad experience,1
excellent phonedevice there is no reason other than chutzpah to spend more than  for a communications device buy this and use the  you save to do something fun unless you really care if your friends judge you for not having the latest iph,5
i love this phone it was packaged with care and the battery was already in it all i had to do was put my sim card in and start talking on the phone easy to set up instructions are online and battery power is strong shipped in one day with prime too thank you,5
the only thing good about this phone is the battery life it do last a long long time  but it very slow an its like the more apps i down load the slower it gets an no i would not recommend this phone to anyone that use there phone alot,1
first impressions are great so far its a good phone high quality feeling somewhat laggy at first but a few updates fix that in a few months when androids usually slow down bad ill see how it does then,4
what can i sayit wasted a few hours of my life to try and update this piece of junk and then when i used it it was very slowdont wastw your time save up some more money and buy a newer better phone,2
the device is seriously under powered maybe the new android go will help as it was when i got it android  it was very slow only usable for simple usage in addition mine had a burnt pixel so i had to return it,1
sorry this video is unsupported on this browser  i bought  of them and they all kept on restarting after updates i know there are cheaper phones out there thatll do better than this not buying any nokia products anymore,1
bought it for my father very nice phone for people who going to use it for calling texting and installing a couple of apps the screen is big  he had iphone  before that and i think he likes his new inexpensive phone definitely worth ,5
i would say dont purchase this phone it is very slow with only  gig of ram what can you expect i use it as a spare phone so its okay but can be frustrating when it takes so long to load apps and we pages the battery is very good though,2
built well it worked fine maybe the first few days after that it took  seconds just to load the home screen video recordings were choppy its fine for calling and the battery life is pretty much as advertised i only had to charge it once every two days,1
this phone is very heavy even with a pop socket its hard to hold  and the battery will last you one day  if you dont talk or text too much its very slow and the back pops off about  times a day  all the negative reviews are true ,1
sin espacio de almacenamiento y rechazando toda tarjeta sim adicional y sin dejar de mencionar su incapacidad de conexión a las redes y lentitud exajerada si pudiera la calificación a este producto sería  no recomiendo,1
it appears to work well its thicker then i expected which is great because i am clumsy with my phones i am excited to see how this one holds up i recommend anyone who is looking for a sturdy reliable phone to purchase the nokia ,5
i wasnt expecting much from this phone considering the price but it exceeded my expectationi like the feel of the phone the screen is good and battery life is amazing it takes more than hrs to charge from  to  the camera is just okay to keep memories,4
smaller size that slides into my pocket easily im not a power user so the processor speed is more than adequate the only negative is that the screen is not as sharp as some of the premium phones but on the bright side i saved ,5
this phone worked great right from the start and its intuitive and user friendlyim still learning how to use it but i think its a winner so farwhat good is all the tech if it wont do what you need it to do this one will,5
i bought this for my youngest child to use he has damaged it already but that was to be expected it only has  gb but he only uses it to make calls and to sometimes text if you are needing a phone for more than that i would recommend a newer better quality phone,3
like the size of the phone and the ease of setting it up disappointed that both sim slots only support g while g will work phone was advertised as having g on sim  update found apn settings from another phone which enabled g,5
nope not my rememberance of nokia also i didnt realize that gb is only for receiving phone n text that is it why make phone wo the proper info on memory size storage size give all info necessary so a return would not be needed ,1
good set of mobile and all is perfect if they add cover   gb sim card and add some more price product will be the best on market  i love it and suggest all people who want more feature at low price its good only gb rom if you add memory card   perfect set,5
i like the way it looks and feel but im unable to connect to g or lte using the phone on att network i got the replacement phone still unable to connect to g or lte after being with an att tech for hours giving this a one star just for that,1
do not purchase i had for  weeks it fell from less than one foot onto wood floor and screen shattered this is suppose to be gorilla glass i do not recommend the two pictures are of the distance it fell and the phone screen i wish i had stuck with samsung,1
this phone seemed like a deal but it has now caused a fire that will cost much more i tried to contact nokia at     which said that there mailbox was full the second forwarded to microsoft the third call said they could not help,1
the worst cellular phone ever slowslowslow it is difficult to get used to other phones when you got an iphone before this phone is cheap and now i know why is garbage doesnt have any pro at allsorry nokia,1

the phone works just fine the way it should but it is locked to tmobile which i already knew but i have been unable to unlock it through the app to unlock the phone in the cell  until i unlock it then i will change my rating,2
the active moto notification system is terrible but you are forced to use it due to the lack of a notification led if i wanted abug as a feature phone i would have bought an iphone as it is this will be going back and ill be sticking with samsung in the future,2
buyer beware item description said that it was brand new but it wasnt att wouldnt unlock it because it was used on a account with them previously think twice about ordering and dont make the same mistake i did,1
i have been using the phone for  months and i really like it finding a screen protector was difficult because of the curved screen the little gain on the curved screen i could have lived without other than that its all good,4
lasted  months before it got the black screen of death a week ago it was already an out of date model when i bought it so im not too upset about it it just pooped out at a horrible time but all in all a great phone camera is good and the phone runs fast,4
received phone box had been previously open set for att network but there was no way to turn on the mobile data making the phone useless unless hooked up to wifi i tried installing the fix from google play store but it did not work waste of time,1

when an update bricks your phone google will not be there to help you out stay away from these devices ive been using nexuspixel for years after a  hour support session im left with a brick and not our fault as the verdict lovely,1
arrived with a noticeable and rather deep  inch scratch on the screen the phone works well otherwise but its not like new i understand the description says limited signs of wear are a possibility and thats why im giving three stars instead of one,3
the phone i received was fine except the touch screen intermittently not responsive this phone was not going to work out for me so i returned it to only get half my refund no explanation as to why just half of what i paid for it buyer beware,1
i have not been able to use this phone the minute it turned on the screen went haywire i was told i needed a new screen in the matter of one day phone screen was completely unable to be used feel like i got robbed,1

i guess its ok for the money but battery life is terrible i had to buy a battery case i havent had it  months and it is starting to stutter and act up i probably am done with pixel phones i have not read good things about  or  guess its back to samsung,2
we had to exchange the first one due to battery life but the second one seems worlds better both were near perfect in case buttons fingerprint reader and screens were immaculate i would recommend them,5
the phones battery drops  percent every two minutes with no apps running including none in the background so will already need to have a new battery installed in it im surprised the phone received such a good grade when its clearly a grade c phone,3

i got my phone inserted my sim card from my old sprint phone into the device and it failed to work i gave the information of the phone to sprint and they told me it was never unlocked in the first place phone looked great and runs fine but no service is a big issue,1
this phone that i got looks brand new has minimum wear and tear the screen looks brand new the back of the phone doesnt have any scratches i am excited about about my new phone the phone was unlocked like it said it on the website,5
it is working good so i love this product but when i choose this product expect just like brand new because it was advertise certificated refurbished product but it had very striking scratch near the camera lens so i was disappointed about that so much,4
i cannot talk about the functionality of the phone because it was a gift what i am happy about is the phone arrived earlier then expected the phone looked brand new and it worked over in the dominican republic with no problem,5
the phone is great the functionality is poor i am experiencing dropped calls not getting calls from family and friends who are trying to reach me and the connectivity to my provider will not complete its process i may have to return it,4
a very good phone until updates that put bixby in control it has run the battery down goes off all the time with questions very annoying  i have tried getting rid of it i have always been a samsung phone guy looks like i am going to switch,2
software is terrible bluetooth works most of the time curved screen makes it impossible to have a glass screen protector or completely enclosed case camera is nice but over all im switching to an iphone next device i buy,1
was excited to use this phone but you did not provide the tool for me to insert my sim card so i will have to wait until i get one of those if you are too cheap to send one you should at least let people know stylus does not work well,1
this is a bargain the phone is great there is a chargersamsung fast charging v plug a cable an adaptor to conect the a normal usb and a micro usb to the phone not the new packaging but the phone works great,5
very good buy i would recommend buying a case for the phone at the same time as it is very slippery it fell out of a shallow pocket and damaged the screen in one corner thank god the whole screen did not shatter i love the phone though so many features,5
it shows signs of wear its not in full new condition performance is ok not great lags a little bit overall its a solid good phone accessing wifi networks needs to be more streamlined the camera has good resolution,4
so far the phone is perfect and i have had no problems with this phone this refurbished phone is basically a new phone i wonder if i got lucky or if the other people that are writing review just got unluckyso far no problems i will update it as the months go on,5
i was really pessimistic after seeing the reviews my note is basically new it actually had many of the original stickers no screen burn in and the battery seems new the charger wasnt samsung but whatever its a basically new note  for half the cost thanks,5
but darn close i got this used and it arrived looking great except without the original box which i really dont care about side by side speed comparison using video games it isnt as fast as my sony xperia xz premium but darn close,4
ive bought  of the note s from this seller for use on straight talks verizon network all  were plug and play pulled the sim out of my old phone and straight into the note s no problem  different lines,5
my expectations for the used note  was way lower than what i actually got it has literally no scratches at all functioning as a normal phone and good battery life this purchase was definitely a good one for me,5
i am galaxy note user this is a very good phone battery life is pretty fine fast shipping and item is very good condition i gave  star because it came with defective charger i like the note  s pen the most this one is very complicated to use,4
absolutely hands down best money ive spent in years phone came exactly when specified works amazingly and even came with a screen protector already on it literally could not have asked for more thank you,5
worst reception of any phone and i use verizon for my carrieri drop almost every call when im driving in when im on high ground near a major cityi used motorola phones my whole life in the same places and never dropped calls,1
battery life is great but it wears out over time ive had this phone for a year and a half now the key is to not have a bunch of apps going at all times and to make sure bluetooth wifi and location are off when not in use amazing phone,5
i phone  is in good condition and works as it should only came with the phone itself and charge cord no plug for cord was included shipping took longer than expected was to be delivered  and arrived december   minimal directions on activating the phone,4
standard iphone  working great only thing it came in a box that said mobile device phone on it total knock off really cheesy and the headphones and charging stuff was gone it was also very clear that it was refurbished,4
i am very satisfied with this purchase great price for  gb i phone  it works very well screen is brilliant all the features work great  today was the third day and battery life was better than my older i phone need to charge it after  days,5
i guess its best to get apple certified refurbished iphones this one cant get a photo or video or even make a phone call for very long without shutting down not like a standard crash that returns you to the home screeninstead the phone just powers off,1
phone looks and works as though it was new i wish they would give a tiny bit of history behind these phones but if i had to guess this couldnt have been owned very long maybe previously open box or return item it came with a screen protector placed perfectly bonus,5
i purchased this phone and spent five hours downloading all of my stuff and charging the battery i put the sim card in and made a phone call and i could hear the people perfectly but they couldnt hear me had to return,1
i liked paying cash for my phone rather than paying the phone company in increments much savings the refurbished phone looks like and works as if new i believe it probably was new just a return from someone else advantageous for me,5
phone had  battery very minor scratches on the screen that was only visible when the screen was off and turned towards a bright light i dont think ill ever buy a new phone again because of the amount i saved,5
this product is falsely labeled as unlocked its been  weeks since i informed that the phone was still locked and all i get are excuses plus the phone came in a really bad condition so many scratches you can see them very clearly,1
really nice phone small minor scuffing by the power button but its in excellent shape worked great going from older iphone se on tmobile took out sim card and put in new device and worked automatically,5
estéticamente perfecto funcionó de la mejor manera pocos días y pero luego no reconocía ninguna red móvil hice el reclamo y la devolución y recibí a los pocos días un reembolso completo sin objeciones vendedor  recomendable,5
simply amazing everything working perfectly including the charger that is shipped with the phone couldnt be happier spending so much money online made me nervous of a scam but luckily this product was delivered as advertised no visible scratches it looks new,5
i ordered the space grey gb iphone x i got and it is damn near mint no marks no scratches even tho it was still on ios  i did upgrade it to ios r i upgraded from a s and im pleased with the peice of mind from amazon and not taking a gamble on ebay,5
i can say its one of the best phone it really look like new though no headphone but it came with charger  and its pretty new no scratches whatsoever thanks to the seller o recommend this seller for the best phone however,5
the iphone i received is in prestine condition and even came with a screen protector already installed not a single scratch or scuff mark anywhere on the phone literally is a brand new phone battery life is at  im extremely happy,5
i have just received this product and i was excited until i noticed a large   inch crack on the screen i have hesitated to turn it on as i am in the process of requesting a return this review will remain at  stars until i receive a refund or replacement,2
as soon as i took it out of the box it wouldnt turn on it didnt have any scratches or anything but it simply wouldnt charge and therefore couldnt use it i was very dissapointed because it had such great reviews and i waited so long to receive it,1
the phone is an upgrade from my last one and the storage is great but when i received my phone i noticed scratches on the screen no big deal but then i realized they were cracks on the screen and not just scratches highly disappointed,1
the phone is working great and didnt come with any scratches or anything wrong with it everything works well and the battery life is great lasts all day and the company the phone is from is a recycling company so they take phones and fix them there was no problems,5
this phone was manufactured for japan so you cant turn off the camera shutter sound very loud and very annoying i never would have bought this phone if id known this there is nothing in description that discloses this info,1
i was a little leery after reading some of the negative reviews i bought this phone for my daughter and it works great no issues at all and it looks brand new it was about  cheaper than a new one shipped fast too as i received it the next day,5
i like it a lot but it seems to be running into a little trouble following my directions and ive lost the voicesound on a couple of the applications i didnt think i would need to have it tune up so soon after i got it  but over all i pretty happy with it ,3
i like this phone a lot doesnt even have a scratch on it im very satisfied with it i read the reviews on the seller and thats why i went with this seller they spoke the truth so far i think i got a good deal,5
i am completeley amazed by how new the phone looks everyting works perfect the phone has no scratches neither does the screen and it even arrived with a glass protector on the screen i am very satisfied with my purchase thank you,5
this phone is great and although it says that it is gsm unlocked my carrier said the phone is somehow not compatible with it my company is sprint i dont understand gsm unlocked should mean that that its able to connect to my provider no,5
my phone arrived quickly and seems to be almost brand new i could not find any small scratches or sign of exterior wear the battery life is incredible i have had the phone for a couple of months now and have not had a single problem,5
easy sim swap took the phone to an apple store and it passed their diagnostics test very good price only problem is that it came with an unofficial charger cable and no headphones but that was expected,5
removed the screen protector that the seller had put on it and found out about the poor state of the screen refurbished means that product has been renewedso a screen without scratches would have been much appreciated seriously,1
this device is unusable for me because the oled pwm pulse width modulation causes headaches and eye strain the lack of fingerprint sensor became a dealbreaker for me as the swiping gestures are high friction effort and dont register consistently i returned mine,1
the phone arrived three day early this phone is beautiful and flawless battery life is more than i expected phone works perfectly i had to contact customer service through email and they responded to my questions immediately,5
all the bells  whistles for half the price of a new one came with a screen protector on it   battery health couldnt have done better anywhere completely unlocked  ready to rock faceid works flawlessly  so did everything else as advertised,5
i have the iphone se but wanted to update so i reviewed all the iphones and found the ten to be the best for the price after using it for a few months i made the right choice i love it and it pairs perfectly with my apple watch,5
i am sure purchasing anything refurbishedrenewed would make anyone nervous i am extremely pleased with this phone it looks new absolutely no scratches or any other imperfections absolutely no issues with setting it up,5
iphone plus advertised as fully unlock it dont work with cdma carriers i am with sprint and went to all the troubles to go to their sprint store and they showed me its only unlocked for gsm carriers grrrr,1
i ordered an  plus and received an  plus very happy with it came in great condition looks like new had my new otter box cover for an  plus ready verizon took care of changing it over and all the details spry delivered as advertised missie,5
so far works great arrived early hooked up to us cellular with no issues keep your receipt though because the manager at the store was rude about it because we live in a bigger town with more crimes and was werry about hooking it up until the receipt was presented,5
i was so skeptical on buying the phone at first because it was refurbished but when i did an it came the phone was like brand new and it came with a charger the camera and everything else was fully functional also it was fully unlocked im so excited thank you breed,5
the charger that came with the phone was not apple verified and it didnt work after a month the phone also has some minor dents and the color was peeling off on the bottom and that was disappointing other than that the phone worked well,4
so far we have not encountered any of the negative issues people talked about in their reviews we were a little hesitant to go the refurbished route but this far we are very happy with the outcome phone looked perfect out of the package,5
hola buenos dias hoy mi teléfono phone se quedo prendido y no quiere a pagar se a calentado de masiado no reponde al control de mando para apagarlo se reinisia solo una y otrabe a manecio loco att un cliente de amazon,1
nothing not to like looked at other sites with renewed phones read reviews most looked like a crap shoot when ordering the phone  than i found the verizon site everything was al bought the phone very happy,5
i had to replace my phone due to a screen issue this was a fantastic replace phone looks and functions as new my only issue was the battery health came at  and the only accessory the charger it came with was flimsy but i have another from my previous phone,5
great phone works perfect it was a gift to my older brother who is going blind and he says he can change settings and see it perfectly the only issue is battery life but i think thats an issue on most phones,4
was a bit nervous about buying a used phone off amazon extremely happy with my purchase its basically a new phone not a single scratch anywhere only complaint is that the battery life is at  but still a lot better than my awful iphone ,4
after i used this phone it have some problemsit will automatically restart when i use itespecially chargingi was scaredbecause i have no extra money to change another phonei was bothered by this problem,1
after i used this phone it have some problemsit will automatically restart when i use itespecially chargingi was scaredbecause i have no extra money to change another phonei was bothered by this problem,1
mint condition sans  minor blemish on the lower left corner which is now covered up by my phone case i have metro by tmobile ie metro pcs and had no trouble activatingusing this phone immediately ,5
i am happy that i found an unlocked iphone x the price was decent i cant say im in love with it bc its more difficult that the iphone  i had getting used to no home button or headphone jack is a bummer,5
the phone i was told by an apple employee should of never been put on the market what a disaster purchase the phone will never work i now have to wait days for return instructions and a refund what a mess i will never use amazon again,1
i received the phone and it was spotless i may have gotten lucky and ended up with one that was purchased new and returned right away im not sure just sharing my experience battery health was  and there was not a scratch on it seemed brand new very happy,5
very disappointed in the product that i received the screen appears to be a cheap aftermarket screen that has lines running through it at low brightness would not recommend using trademore if you want a quality device,2
great to be back to iphone delivered on time and functions well needed assistance from apple store for data transfer but since i bought here they would not help put me on to an app that did not transfer all data still trying to get photos downloaded to phone,5
great product i using it now to type this up but only bad thing is a few scratches on the sides if it came with headphones and was like  cheaper i would totally recommend but it is refurbished so dont expect alot of greatness,4
the best decision ive made buying a phone phone is in perfect condition battery condition is at  best value for the price much cheaper than buying a new phone directly from verizon brand new will absolutely buy me next phone from verizon preowned,5
it seems to be a replaced screen iphone x the top wasnt completely perfect fitted but pressing it got it solved otherwise it looked like a brand new phone in great shape too bad the cable and charger are not original,5
the pone looks ok doesnt look used or refurbished but when i opened it the upper microphone was not working i have to talk on speaker mode in order to hear the other personas voice i will ask for a refund or a solution to this,1
it looked new and work like one straight from the store but a third of the price bought this for my wife and she loves it i also have a refurbished android it has never given any problems refurbished is the way to go for me now,5
worst phone ive ever had in my life has a mind of its own clicks on whatever it wants and downloads whatever it wants honestly feel like i was given a phone that had a virus before would rate  stars if possible,1
i was very weary buying this but it was definitely worth my money some minor scratches but who cares battery life was at  and all i had to do was put my sim in very happy with this purchase thank you,5
there are many dead spots on the display it was not that bad at first but progressively got worse so i took to the apple store they said it would cost  to fix it should of just bought a new phone from the apple store live and learn,1
iphone x  gb space gray desbloqueado y funcionando perfectamente la batería tiene  de vida vino con cargador genérico pero de carga rápida  rayones en la pantalla  tiene unos en los lados en general por  un excelente teléfono,5
this was my first time buying anything amazon certified refurbished i was impressed the phone looked new when i say the phone looked new i mean no scratches or scuffs at all the phone operates and functions like brand new,5
i purchased this phone in advance for someones birthday the seller advertised the phone to be unlocked i was deeply embarrassed when they went to  different stores that said the phone was not unlocked,1
a good phone in good condition battery life shows  very minor scratches here and there that youll never notice will update the review in a few months to let you know whether the performance is still good,5
was a bit hesitant to buy at first because of some bad reviews but i was amazed when i open the package my iphone was in great working condition and looked good as new its been  months a still no problems if your hesitant to buy i say go for it,4
the phone was garbage didnt use for a month and is totally died have been contacting the support center from the very first month i received the only option im left is to stop doing business with you frustrated customer,1
i bought two phones and paid for the next day delivery on monday and instead i just received one phone today wednesday im really angry and disappointed i just started an investigation with amazon ,1
purchased through trademore looked like new couldnt find one scratch battery life was at  when arrived now went down to  after about a month of use phone seems to work like new overall im happy with purchase,5
i dont think the iphone x is a bad phone overall i just got a bad refurbished one from trademore mobile it looked brand new but the touch screen had a dead area so i was never able to even set up the phone,1
ive ordered this phone twice and both times i received a gsmonly phone the description clearly says fully unlocked for both gsm carriers like att and tmobile and cdma carriers like sprint and verizon this is not true this phone doesnt work on verizon,1
regular bluetooth is not connected to airpords when the airpords leave their ears and can not be connected every time they are put back into their ears it is extremely inconvenient and extremely disgusting,1
decent and far cheaper than anything but when i received it the listening part of the phone when you make calls is always muffled didnt come with all accessories or book as noted but it would have been nice to get,4
arrived faster than expected the set up was very easy product looks and functions like new no scratches or dents just be careful from what seller you buy from i got from buyspry and i have no complaints,5
the one i received wont hold charge even with a new battery it was also carrier locked to mint mobile when it seems too good to be true it always is lesson learned would never do business with them again customer service is also terrible and not helpful,1
bought this one last month were always scare to buy a deffective product this one is working very well no scratch look brand new  the only complaint is that phone kinda heat sometime not sure if its normal,4
great phone fast shipping great price there were however more scratches on the screen than i anticipated no cracks or defections but the screen was more scratched up than what i would expect for a certified refurbished phone,3
phone matches to the description no scratches dents or cracks on the device it works as good as new im glad that i didnt face any problems with my device so far ive been using it for the last  months or so thank you,5
i received the iphone early than expected but phone wasnt detecting other networks i did reset network settings reset all settings hard reset nothing worked so i returned the phone at the same day i received,1
phone is ok but no box and pack unprofessional charging cable white and black plug unprofessional it look like  phone after looking at it beause of box that that the put the phone in and the way the pack it,2
me gustó el pruducto llegó bien y sin ningún rasguño con el cargador original la batería llegó al  de su capacidad pero contaba con applecare así que cuando fui a la ishope lo repararon sin ningún costo,5
i bought my iphone back in april  and in november  not even a year old the touch screen started not to work went to an apple store to get it fixed and  later i find its one of the wires that was twisted that caused the screen not to work,1
the phone i bought was even more than i had expectedcleanno scratch and was working from get gohave no complain used it for paying bills when shopping by using the samsung pay great phoneeasy to used would recommend it to any one,5
i buy the phone for my sister in jamaica and and she tell me after  days it stop working i am trying to get it back up so i can send it back because its not fair to spend so much money on a phone and its not working please tell me what to do,1
when my wifes old ipad started to give her problems we bought this refurbished air  and i must say that it looks and operates like a new one cant give any details on how long it will last but at this time we are very happy with it,5
its very good now but when we first bought it it was on ios  or i dont remember but it took over  day to update it to the current ios it was annoying but now it runs perfect and the screen is very very clear,4
only one forth of the apps would load had to return for refund reordered apparently from a different company and the second one would not activate how difficult would it be to test them before shipping them out,1
ipad came well packaged and has worked perfectly far exceeds my old ipad that ive used for over  years the battery life is much longer that my first one ever was love the finger print id feature surprisingly easy to transfer all my stuff from old to thenew one,5
so far this tablet has done all i need it to do battery life seems very good appearance was excellent it was purchased for work applications and has performed well if anything changes ill update my review,5
the ipad works well battery life is great so it appears they truly replaced it and no scratches on the screen there is an etched out spot where it appears there had been engraving but its covered by my case anyway very happy with this purchase,5
very good replacement for ipad previously just wish that apple would have diagnostics for their products which would give a hint or warning that they are about to go kaput  day before the old ipad worked fine next day nothing,4
i was very disappointed in this product the description said it was like new the product i received had a dent on the back scratches on the glass screen and scratches on the side while it functioned fine it had a lot of wear on it,2
seems to work well appearance was pristine good value charging cable is very cheap and will not charge ipad it will charge iphone not a big deal did not expect a good charging cable and was not disappointed overall happy with the purchase,5
i was a little skeptical about getting this ipad as its been  years since its release and previously owned however it came like brand new and works brilliantly i was able to update to the current  os im beyond happy i took the chance on this purchase,5
this ipad appears almost as new it updated the os as soon as i linked it to my account all functions seem to be working fine only up to day  with it so time will tell as of now i couldnt be happier with this purchase thank you,4
i did not like how it was delivered my daughter lives in an apartment on the ground floor and this package was left on the doorstep i found this utterly stupid with all the thieving going on it is just being used for personal use and she seems happy with i,4
unfortunately i purchased  ipad air  but both have alot of scratchs in the screen and from behind also with very cheap charger charging slowly also very clear the screen not original not value for maney unfortunately i regret buying both,2
i connected several different charging cords to this phone purchased from buyspry and none of them would reliably stay connected these cords all work just fine with my old phone sent back to seller and refund has been approved,1
i used to have this phone  loved it which is why i ordered it for my mom i ordered on a saturday  she got it monday afternoon these guys are excellent mom went rogue  dont need the phone anymore but edge cellular has been amazing thank you for your help,5
i bought a refurbished iphone  g unlocked black it would not charge past  i left it on the iphone charger all night in the morning i found it hard bricked nothing would wake it up i contacted support and its been three days no answer very poor form,1
specifically ordered the black and received gold not total happy with white face frame but decided since i have it in case i would keep it after i tested all functions phone worked fine and battery charged to  and successfully restored from backup,4
it took me a while to get used to the bigger screen vs a c but it is as advertised it has a better camera and battery for sure no real issues with it it is a better deal than buying a brand new phone and i cant tell much difference,5
lots of issues with this phone even after tons of updates and setting changes some letters have to be hit  times before theyre recognized and type frequently shuts down without notice always needs to be restarted waste of money and time will not buy again,1
i got my phone for my mom who lives in the philippines we put her local sim card in and it worked perfectly the phone works like new battery life is excellent screen is good camera is good everything about it is good,5
i was nervous about buying this when i read the reviews but when i got i it was in perfect condition and worked great with my att sim card the memory is low but works good for me with a gb sd card overall im happy with the purchase,5
i got the phone which looks like its in good condition but the battery that came with the phone was swollen and too big for the phone so i havent got it to turn on to see if the phone even works im very upset with this product,1
had to buy this because i destroyed mine and could not justify spending another  there were some minor scratches but overall everything works just fine i would totally buy from this seller again if needed,5
i bought this phone on ebay it was alot cheaper  audio  front cam  rear camera  batterly life it can go maybe  hours makes me glad i didnt buy this phone brand new would have been a waste sorry being honest,3
i bought this phone for my husband and it has been wonderful it was totally unlocked for my sprint network and its been great so far hes only had it for about a month but everythings perfect we love it,5
its been almost a year since ive ordered this phone and i can honestly say its the best phone ive ever had screen quality is great i love the edge features and ive put this phone though hell and not a single scratch,5
great phone seller was great to work with would order again have had the phone for  months now and no problems way to go when buying a phone for a kid will never pay the store prices again until he gets his own job and pays for it,5
when i bought this phone it was said it was unlocked for gsm and that i could use it with metro pcs when i put my sim card in it told me it was not a verizon card im really disappointed and would like a refund,1
the back cover was very badly glued the phone was locked to verizon carrier and the original verizon sim was left inside the seller requires that i pay for the return label even though it was their fault to sell phone in this condition,1
arrived in like new condition with no dents dings or scratches  battery holds a full charge  activated with straight talk verizon with no problems new buyers should wait for the price to come down with the new ss coming out this week ,5
looked like brand new original box and new charger wire and adapter bought for daughter for gift but her boyfriend bought her brand new google pixel  the same day i ordered this so i returned it really hated to as it was in perfect condition,5
recieved this product and all looked great until i tried to activate it on the verizon network turns out it was a tmobile phone and was locked on that carrier so it was unusable sent it back and have yet to get my money back,1
best phone i had in my life got stolen tried to replaced it from amazon the phone from this seller had a purple vertical line on the screen bad screen contact felt scammed gifted it and got the s still missing the s edge though,1
it is supposed to be a reconditioned phone i dont know if it was done properly i get phone calls and there is no one there when i answer when i am talking to someone theyre voice stops they can hear me but i cant hear them,1
bought a refurbished phone samsung s edge the phone had no voicemail app had a pink line down the screen warranty was up and one day after it was up the phone turns on turns off turns on turns off and never comes back on complete waste of money,1
phone appearance is that of a brand new phone im using tmobil on my unlocked verizon and its perfect no issues my only issue is my battery is draining faster than a new battery would i have had no mechanical or physical issues so far so good,5
so far havent had a single issue with mine plus the build quality is up there with apples iphones and yet this one for the generation had the better screen and camera than the iphone so yes a definite buy from me,5
phone received looked like new no scratches or cosmetic blemishes were apparent at all comes in a generic box with charger and cablenothing else but for the price it was well worth it the phone worked right out of the box without any issues love it,5
gave it two stars only because the only thing the phone i got has going for it is that it looks new and turns on the phone is slow battery drains quickly heats up after a few minutes of light use and the lcd has burns in it,2
i talked my husband into going with this and wow am i feeling stupid now phone arrived dead and will not take a charge another week without a phone because of no fault of my own buyer beware obviously it wasnt checked at all,1
had the phone a couple of days and so far has exceeded expectations super easy to migrate data from previous phone would have been nice to have the adapter included but wifi process worked just fine all in all would recommend this phone,5
i believe i overpayed for this product as it is just a refurbished model with no accessories but it did came mint condition with no scratches or issues and a  day warranty so i am content with the product received,5
had this phone a couple of weeks now phone arrived like brand new not a mark or scratch on it checked out all functions and it works flawlessly battery performs like new very fast shipping would definitely purchase from buyspry again very satisfied,5
got this for my mother as a christmas gift as someone who never had a smartphone before she loves it does everything you would want a smartphone to do and easy enough to learn although a few models behind the hardware is solid love the camera quality as well,4
when i got the phone i had a hard time getting verizon to activate finally after  days i was able to get my phone working the phone is great looks brand new and a lot cheaper than a brand new one you wont be disappointed at all with this phone,5
description says it all the phone itself is in excellent condition but i find myself needing to recharge before end of day with little use right out the box i expected a certified refurbished product to have a better battery life,3
muy buen celular funciona en ecuador al principio no aceptaba el sim card pero nos contactamos con el mail que nos vino en una hoja dentro del paquete del celular y nos dieron las indicaciones para poder desbloquear y funcionó enseguida,5
phone is very easy to use but the battery life isnt that great i could not register this phone with straight talk directly but i could just pop the sim card in and it was working what i did notice was that the signal was not as strong,5
nothing but flying stars for me here i had a ss had for years now its dosent work any more so i got an sedge and i always wanted one good to see that their just ass good as always i love you samsung always will loyal to the end,5
what really makes this phone for me is the speed of the processorits extremely fast of course the brilliant  display is amazing as is the mp camera my only dislike is that the phone is unbelievable fragile invest in a good case,5
i enjoy everything about my sims song i love it the only thing i dont like is that i have metro pc network is an unlocked phone so my network drops every once in awhile my phone calls drop every once in awhile but other than that i enjoyed it,5
no problems at all i have had it for about a month now the only thing that i noticed was there was a a faint scratch on the back but that is the only thing that i have noticed overall i am pleased with this purchase,5
bought this for my brother phone came in great condition works perfectly like brand new battery life sustainable and he only has to charge once daily camera works great no scratchesdents cracks is as exactly as described and more,5
my daughters phone had quit on her  this was an upgrade for her we were very pleased with this phone  it was everything the seller advertised about i would recommend to anyone this phone fast service  great product cant get no better than that,5

lasted  months then died will not turn on oh well maybe i can trade it in and get a new phone instead of a refurbished now i am back on my old s which is still working lesson learned s was a flawed phone to many bad reviews,3
this phone arrived as expected and it is a new phone it shows no wear or used i am extremely pleased with this purchase one comment the battery does go down faster than expected but with a charger no problem,5
no blemishes on the phone perfect conditionbut a full battery will last me literally an hour and a half with medium battery settings apps freeze and sometimes dont even open overall bad performance,1
el telefono no se encuentra completamente desbloqueado se puede usar en mexico con telcel y solo entran las llamadas pero no cuenta con internet y en euu no se puede usar con otra compania q no sea verizon,1

phone has black lines across screen spoke with samsung which referred me to their repair place i was informed that the screen would need to be replaced with a genuine screen for about  my bad for purchasing a used certified refurbished phone,1
very pleased this far arrived in a timely manner and looks new ive been using the phone for  hrs now and learning it this is exactly what i expected and was hoping for good price and good purchasing experience,5
the product arrived on time and in great condition it was almost like it was brand new software works fine and im loving the battery life the new updates are definitely worth the purchase glad i bought it,5
phone came perfect and right on time the only thing that bothers me is if you dont have a verizon sim it pops up on my window and i cant access my voicemail but all in all good product for the amount i paid,4
i love my phone i just dont like the fact that it did not come in  days like i paid for you all should do better because it can you business im so upset because i have been without a phone since i bought it,5
dont buy this i bought two as gift thats why i took so long to review one came with a pink line in the screen the other with two areas in screen with low light and both with battery problems take forever to charge and discarger in one hour,1
not only did my phone arrive late but it came completely destroyed at least some of the other reviewers had a phone that actually worked mine wouldnt even turn on and not even the charger was salvageable please tell me this is a joke,1
i m very sad to say that this iteam doesnt fit as i expected it didnt work on my network so i sent it back to amazon hope next time whenever i will buy anything from amazon would be great work samir parmar,1
after less than tow months  the mobile is two hot and gives me notification that is calling itself which leads to close the programme that i am working with i cant put it in my ears because of its heat,1
this is exactly like a brand new phone amazing it did not come with the tool to get the sim card but i read a paper clip works and it did no ear phones but with difference in price for a new sedge who cares,5
received my order sooner than originally told so a plus there i received phone completely drained of battery but plugged in and charged pretty quickly no problems at verizon activating it and after having for a week im definitely happy with the purchase,5
seller was great edge phone is just waiting to break the screen i dropped it once and it hit the side completely ruined the screen including the led display phone was done for i went back to regular samsung galaxy afterwards,3
the device works well but it can not upgrade from os  to os  because the baseband sm ga and you need a different baseband to get the android os  i cannot even get the  upgrades so i am stuck with outdated software,1
phone has worked well purchased about  months ago and havent had any issues minor scratches on the home button completely cosmetic no issues but otherwise looks brand new works with a prepaid plan  boom mobile on the verizon network,5
it looks and works like new i have the blue corral i love the color i was going from a htc  which was a great phone but this phone is even better would defiantly purchase again the picscolors are amazing on this phone,5
not sure if i just got a lemon but bought in january worked ok through febbut then the battery life goes from sugar to shi in a matter of a couple calls or like a half hour of use very disappointed do yourself a favor buy new,1
im really glad i chose this seller and this phone if it werent for the fact that it was listed as a refurbished phone i wouldve never known it works like a gem and i woukd highly recommend this to anyone,5
the s edge is very nice it is my st smart phone and since its android  samsung just like my tablet very easy to use verizon set it up with a sim card and i was ready to go all my contacts transferred with no problem,5
i used to make refurbished phones and i was quite happy at the quality it appears they replaced all the outside components now with that said wow verizon phones have a lot of junk software and a locked boot loader,5
phone is nice and in good condition however the details said the phone was gsm unlocked when i put my gsm sim card it it said invalid sim must be verizon etc i had to root the phone in order to get my sim card to work,3
phone received is having scratch on top near sim card and also charger provided is not fast charger charger and usb cable provided with phone is of low quality  not happy phone sold was suppposed to be of new refurbished quality it have scratches,1
i was hesitant however the phones came in brand new condition and were unlocked they easily set up to verizon pre paid have had ours for about a month and love them would definitely use this seller again,5
i normally wouldnt buy refurbished electronics but took a chance and gotta say im glad i did phone came in great condition only had a tiny scratch on the back which my case covers anyway screen is perfect phone works great,4
this phone is affordable and has amazing quality i went from iphone to this and i will never turn back beautiful camera quality and speaker quality and the battery my iphone would need a charge by noon this is built to last forget samsung or iphone,5
the screen is the perfect size the battery will last me all day with somewhat consistent use of the phone it is a very stylish and cool looking phone no complaints when it comes to gaming it hits the mark there as well so all around a great phone for the price,5
after using it for just  week i started getting strange black boxes on my screen very dissatisfied this would happen after i swiped right to access google and then go back to the main screen this definitely should not be happening,2
after my note  died i thought id try something different from samsung device the phone is okay but features are disappointing the rear camera is awful especially in dark lighting great selfie phone if youre into that but thats it,2
i like the phone i switched to this from a iphone se and this sony phone seems a little quirkier then the iphone its not as smooth and not as fast as the iphone and the battery life is good not terrible but i think it could be better,4
i really loved the product for the first  months however it now barely works and there has been no damage to it i highly recommended this product to several friends but now need to let them know i changed my mind contacted sony and nothing has helped,1
this is by far better than any iphone ive had easy transfer from old phone takes great pictures sound is great easy to expand memory as well dont have any connection or streaming issues which i constantly had with iphones,5
crap phone dont ever buy it camera processor phone all crapeverything is crap only fit for using as a toy never buy sony sony is wastewasted moneybuy always samsungsumsung is the besttank u,1
hyper sensitive touch screen and sends random messages to random contacts without user input unable to even formulate simple message typing and put together words for sending i hope sony will back up their product with warranty,1
got this today and i have to say i am sold on sony phones screen looks great i like the weight and it just looks awesome if you are wanting a great phone for non idiot flagship prices you should go with this,5
the phone is a really well made phone it is in better condition than expected the touch screen is glitching out but its not major it may be because my fingers are sweaty overall a beautiful and good phone,4
my only real issue is the back cover was peeling off the phone on arrival most likely due to the refurbishing process a phone case fixed that other than that though this has quickly become my favorite phone nice screen super responsive and seems pretty solid,5
i have  of these phones and the touchscreen is starting to have problems on one and wont recognize the position of where you touch found similar issues on youtube phone is  months old and very good condition never been dropped,2
am loving my new phone everything works perfectly since am a professional photographer the phone camera do not matter to much i havent use the camera yes i recommend this phone to anyone who wants to buy it,5
i was a bit skeptical since my previous sony phone wasnt as good as they advertised especially the battery life it was abysmal at best however this phone is doing all the things its supposed to and then some,5
the touchscreen is complete garbage and has no calibration option wasted  trying for a working phone ended up with trash that spazzes out anytime i touch to high on the screen save your money on this one,1
i did a lot of research and have to say it paid off in this case i absolutely love this phone beautiful panel snappy response awesome audio this is a perfect media delivery device couldnt be happier,5
great phone coming from moto gplus thought this phone might be too big but within week got used to it big screen a plus cant read on smaller screens fast great resolution camera wonderful battery day plus never heats up great phone,5
bought my sony a couple of weeks agophone is great from size to camerabut ill only get one bar from my wifi at home and the signal is very poorwas using a zte had no problems with when it comes to signalis anyone having that problem,3
i needed a replacement phone and i got this on a whim it arrived to me appearing practically new and has served me well since i received it for basic phone use and internet shennanigans its hard to beat,5
this is the worst phone that i have ever used the screen goes wonky from time to time and it ends up accessing items that you did not select searching in the forums indicates that it is a common issue with no resolution,1
had the phone for two days now and i love it the battery life lasted me a whole day and some change that is awesome this is the first time ive bought a phone this expensive im really happy this is the one i chose,5
please help memy phone sucks bad photos bad batter and video when i say bad they just suck how can i fix this with the settings or another app i might have to move to apple i need this for my job and i have the worst photos and the color is crap,1
buy this phone only if you still believe japanese quality is great and willing to contribute more to sony mediatek cpu average camera plus cheap plastic built this phone should be sold for  not  sony sucks,1
the sony xperia l is a good choice for a budget phone it set up fine and i have had no problems with it however i easily prefer a phone that sells for  less that is faster sleeker and sexier so i knocked off a star,4
este teléfono está en una lista negra de la compañía donde lo compraron por falta de pago no entiendo cómo pueden vender un artículo que no está pagado completamente por favor necesito que me regresen mi dinero lo antes posible yo lo voy a envía de regreso,1
great phone but very disappointed that it doesnt mention anywhere that it is a verizon sourced refurbished pixel  which leaves all of us who need an unlocked bootloader stuck please change labeling or include a disclaimer,1
sadly the phone was defective and unable to connect to a lte network would cycle on and off i tried tmobile and google fi and neither would work after speaking with google support as well as tmobile it was suggested that the phone was defective,1
the phone that i received was not unlocked when i called google they told me i would have to deal with verizon and verizon wanted my phone number which i do not have returning as this was not as advertised,1
i have never had a pixel phone before and heard great review about them so i order one what i thought was a pixel  but today when i went to purchase a case to my surprise i have a pixel xl i am so disappointed i paid  for a older model pixel,1
other than the squeeze feature not working on arrival the phone is fine i dont care too much about that feature but its something you should check immediately upon delivery so you dont end up out of the return period before you notice,3
ive always loved googles phones and this one is the best ive had yet it is a verizon variant so the bootloader is locked it had been updated to pie android  so theres no work around for me to unlock it sadly  even so great phone,5
great phone i have been using an iphone for many years first time with something different there is a learning curve but overall i am extremely satisfied the battery life is excellent i never have to charge the phone during the day,5
as described some scratches in the front but the phone otherwise works very well wife is happy with her gift she says it feels new no lag in the software no glitching camera works fine and we have no problems charging this is a long term review,4
spontaneously died in my pocket one week outside the  day amazon return window and google wouldnt give me an rma because it was a fi phone and i wasnt the original owner of record beware when buying used google phones,3
no issues with this phone at all unlocked version works seemlessly with my mvno sim mint mobile runs off tmobile towers updated to latest version of android pie unlocked rooted all works as expected my phone came from wootcom if that makes any difference,5
ugh i hate this phone the keyboard is a train wreck its like the keys are offest from where they appear on the screen so when i type n i get the space bar when i type m i get a period etc the finger print reader works about half the time,2
looks like a brand new phone battery life is shorter than my previous moto g but that may be due to all the newer features using up more battery power taking more pictures now that i have a great camera phone very pleased with this purchase,5
phone was in excellent condition no lagging or inconveniences its like a brand new phone i love it and the best part is the price wasnt crazy expensive its the second phone i buy from kanga and no complaints on either device i definitely recommend them,5
my girlfriend was excited to get this as a present battery life is trash less than  minutes after a full charge the battery died i have a pixel  and the battery lasts a whole day trashy piece of refurbished plastic,1
the phone came a day earlier than originally planned no scratchesdingsmarks looks new so far everything works wonderfully it was very easy to transfer old phone to the pixel overall happy with the quality,5
i love this phone ill probably never go back to the samsung galaxy line the only issue i have is that the touch screen messed up when it is charging it will act like ive touched a different part of the screen,5
this renewed pixelxl gb works perfectly from the seller but you will need to spend the time to update to android  i have tested for everything including mobile hotspot highly recommend this for a cheap  renewed pixel this replaced my original pixel phone,5
phone came undamaged but a a rattle to it it works fine though and i have had no issues at all with performance so its just an annoyance not a functional issue love the pixel  though performance is fantastic and photo quality is amazing,4
for the price tag that is has people may be skeptical as to how good the pixel  really is however that price tag is misleading because of the myriad of things the phone is equipt with wonderful interface breathtaking camera and the google ai is unmatched,5
great buy im coming from a samsung s so i might be easily impressed but the camera functionality storage space fantastic bought it with the amfilm screen protector teelevo wallet case  micro usb to usb c adapters,5
the phone was in good condition and works acoording to what i expected the charger is not original though it says slow charging not even charging the seller must mention it somewhere before the purchase,3
ive had this phone for a few weeks now and havent really encountered any bugs or problems seems to work and look like a brand new phone love the camera on the pixel  and that was the main feature i desired in this phone,5
great phone for a great price only downfall was the shipping i ordered it for christmas for my son and it was shipped to wrong location so my son didnt get it until four days after christmas but he said it was totally worth the wait,5
i bought this phone in october and the charging port was a little loose after the  month warranty the audio no longer worked from the port and  months later the phone no longer takes a charge it costs  to fix a port on the pixel ,1
i really like this phone and will be getting the newer version bc i like this one so much its fast and works good for a referbished phone a few little glitches but nothing phone breaking or a deal breaker id recommend,4
great phone overall love android  keep in mind the  day return policy i should have reached out sooner because the charge port is loose but it worked well enough now i cant process a fix or return,5
i have got a refurbished google pixel  today it was disappointed to see its lower end of the screen has come out and because of it creates a noise while typing it is very annoying to hear that tapping noise,2
as far as the phone is concerned i give it  stars but not from this seller in the product description it clearly states that this phone is compatible with all carriers but it is most certainly not compatible with verizon very annoyed,1
treated very sophisticated very very  i have recovered the phone because the phone screen draws  retrieved from jordan to america  when the seller received  all my money backthank you google and thank you,5
would be a decent phone but theres no headphone jack in exchange the bezels are still huge and theres an included usb c to headphone adapter that flatly doesnt work if you search reddit or online forums the headphone adapter doesnt seem to work for anyone,2
phone works great but is not oem unlocked seems the phones are coming from bestbuy verizon or similar as they are oem locked i wish it was made clear in the sellers description to save me hours of searching on the internet,1
while the camera for this phone is amazing the actual phone is trash im pretty sure this phone wasnt new when i got it the phone keeps saying no service no matter what i try phone freezes and over heats and the touch doesnt work that well just horrible,1
my boyfriend and i have had the moto x for about  years now we upgraded back then to play a gps game and now to have the newest processor the phones do not use mico usbs for their charging cord but other than that ive yet to find a downside,5
sent out extremely fast and exactly as described however im going to have to lower it down to a  star because someone decided to stick a barcode sticker right on the phone which leaves that sticky residue behind thats a pain in the ass to get off,4
i am so disappointed the back camera stopped working after only  months of usage no damage experienced tried all of googles troubleshooting including a factory reset to no avail extremely disappointing,1
described by the seller as minimal to no physical damage the phone was anything but it had very deep gouges along the frame and the screen was covered in small abrasions and scratches clearly this phone was used without a case before and was not cared for,1
i love this phone got it and switched to google fi service no issue with the refurbished version just be aware that the phone only connects to headphones via bluetooth never going back to cell phones sold from mainstream suppliers,5
i had my previous phone for  years so youd have to know it was a major jump up ive had it about a month now and ive had no issues the phone came in basically new condition with an earphone adapter and ridiculously fast charger value for money is outta there,5
everything on this used phone works great i am very happy with this purchase and would buy from this seller again i was afraid to buy sno they used phone because i have been burned multiple times in the past but this seller is legit,5
bought as a renewed phone it appears to be brand new with no scratches or wear at all i put my straight talk sim in and it worked instantly upgrading from the s this phone feels lightyears ahead of it,5
phone works but when were adding it to our cellphone plan we needed to open the sim card slot upon doing this the sim card holder popped out but it was broken it would not hold the sim card since it was broken,2
one can only hope this phone doesnt have the microphone hardware issue  the microphone for your voice  you know so you can use it for a phone mine does and because i scuffed it the warranty was void even though the phone was only  weeks old,2
este teléfono está en una lista negra de la compañía donde lo compraron por falta de pago no entiendo cómo pueden vender un artículo que no está pagado completamente por favor necesito que me regresen mi dinero lo antes posible yo lo voy a envía de regreso,1
dudeall i have to say is i bought this for my wife to replace her broken screened lg after i accidentally threw my j sky pro into a  degree fryer at work and it survived im writing this review on that very phone,5
failed within  weeks of use keep buying replacements of different manufacturers phones that are unlocked androids but have had negative resultsguess i will try wallmart straight talk all my associates are happy with the walmart product,5
this ipad is very slow almost useless for my yo gaming needs also never received the case in the picture not sure if it said it supposed to come with it or not in the description the case is not a big concern,2
my apple ipad  mclla tablet was pre owned so i cant do anything with it unless i find previous owner to delete their account i am humbly asking if there is anyway you can help find owner or replace my ipad,2
loved it at first but then when i wanted to connect the phone to my company it was lockex i have already requested the unlocking code but it had been  month and i have yet to have a response do not recommend will change my mind once i get the code,1
i loved the phone but only had it for  months to the day before it completely crapped out on me for no reason now im left with no phone until i can afford to buy a new one wont buy product from this seller ever again,2
the phone came as advertised very little to know wear the battery storage space along with the quality and clarity of the screen is excellent the phone was a super upgrade from my s and i will purchased from them again,5
over all great phone but i have only had it for a week and the battery is dying way to fast i only have gb of apps and  pics and now it wont even charge charger works fine with tablet major disapointment,3
great phone but i often only get g data speeds after doing some reading it seems this phone is an international version that does not include several frequency bands used by g in the us also does not include a compass,1
moto gs plus is very powerful and easy to use once you have gotten acquainted with it its picture taking is very powerful and easy to use and exploring its operations it is a great phone at a very reasonable price,4
the product is great and the upgrade is great too i dont know why people say is a junk i am on the united states and im using this phone im loving it like food so nice and fast clear and the camera is great,5
its disappointing to know that the phone doesnt comes with nfc since nfc is included in international model but not in us one planning on return at first but since its a very nice phone overall changed my mind and kept it worth the price,4
great phone but like others who have left reviews it often loses service and the connection can be super slow when it shouldnt be it doesnt seem to be super compatible with tmobile network love the phone but sad that i often lose service,1
we got new screen installed on  through a professional but it started developing cracks which was first noticed on  i wanted to inform that there was no mobile drop it developed cracks on its own,1
after about  weeks of usage it stopped working motorola offered zero support they kept toying with me asking  the same information again and again and they never did anything pictures attached are after weeks of frustration,1
good phone good price less than  compared to everything else out there i will never spend  to  for a phone this phone works great for me good screen pictures voice quality texting and some browsing,5
i replace a samsung galaxy s with this phone i enjoy this phone however i was having problems with data and wifi i put my sim card into the second sim card slot and got better signal the bad thing is that i cant use the sd slot now,3
unfortunately this phone does not work on verizon in the us it was advertised as being unlocked for the us but it will not connect to the verizon network the phone itself is probably fine if you choose the correct carrier,1
hands down the absolute worst phone i have ever had i bought it direct from manufacturer still no oreo basic functionality is mostly absent from this phone location sucks bluetooth sucks headphone jack sucks etc,1
scammer it does not work at all and it is damaged a lot the only thing you can see is icloud login page which is the first one thats all nothing works and they deducted the cost to refund even thought it is because their fault,1
the piece in question was not labelled as an att phone for thise of you that dont know att and verizon use different types of networks so this phone will not work with verizon get an international version instead,1
the speaker to play musicvideos out loud doesnt work it just makes a crackling noise and the phone isnt truly unlocked you can only use it for att very disappointed as this was a big purchase for me to make,1
its kinda glitchy sometimes with apps and im a little worried about the charging port but hey thats what the insurance is for overall im pretty satisfied consider that a new phone is like double to triple this so its not a bad deal,4
love the phone everything works perfectly it is an att phone but i have no problem with my service on the tmobile network the phone was in good condition for being a use one i would recommend this phone and would buy again,5
will never buy a phone for rull price again great phone for the value unlocked ao you can travel outside of the country and works just a nice as a brand new phone a bonus is that i didnt have to pay a thousand dollars for it,4
phone came in very blemished scratched screen had a hit and was peeling for a new or almost new condition description this one dropped the ball it could have been a mistake but you have one chance to make the right impression,1
i miss phone calls and texts on tmobile tmobile says it doesnt connect or work with part of their system they have tried to fix it several times but it always goes back to missing calls and missing texts its a nice phone with a good battery,2
the phone was ok but there was not much explanation of the carrier options the only carrier i could get to activate was t mobile i gave the phone to a nephew because none of the other carriers would trade it,2
love this phone was skeptical at first but i am so surprised at the quality and the performance of this device i switched from a iphone and will never go back to an apple product ever again simply a awesome phone and at a super great price,5
its been about  weeks since my purchase im getting serious and progressively worsening cracking and static during calls im not able to put phone to my ear its perfect apart from that but its a major issue,2
great phoneaffordable sleek no performance issues so far there seems to be a problem with the auto focus on the camera i think an update from asus part should fix this in the future in my experience asus is good at getting those updates out asap,4
great phone i bought mine from best buy and price matched it with amazons price and got a free  best buy gift card so dont buy it off amazon go to best buy and price match amazon and get a free gift card,5
i sure wish i had stayed with the better phones samsong  htc maybe one more this last one zen fone where is this one any good at  weeks not one call im a working man maybe a little lazy with no time for this phone i want to send it back is it to late,1
its a great phone to say the least im very happy with it its fast has lots of cool features the screen is great and i love the g of memory no more you have to remove apps msgs worth the money,5
i have this phone for a week yesterday i installed asus updates and now i cant download any apps i contacted asus support and they told me to do the factory reset i will be returning this phone also if you care about sound quality the speakers are very weak,1
the phone would do everything except make a call i spoke to customer service which was very good and they determined it had a hardware issue i think they need to get more serious about quality control if they want to get in to this market,1
never owned an asus zenphone and wow this phone is a killer love the design and the features it has builtin amazing battery life and awsome cameras with some high tech features not a single complaint cant wait for oreo update thanks asus,5
i bought from south western limited the lowest price the phone got a brand new but this is not suitable for use  there are a lot of lags and a very bad camera i continue it optimization probably i will return it back,2
i love everything about this phone especially the camera the size is perfect and fits comfortably in my hand battery life is great too also my order came with  months of mint mobile service which i was not expecting thanks,5
bought this phone about a month ago or less battery life is terrible this is my third pixel  xl needless to say im use to the phone contacted the supplier and was told to contact google seriously now the sensor is gone,1
product arrived defective the screen wasnt working properly and kept flickering not sure if it was physical damage or software but definitely should have been caught in the quality inspection process wont buy again,1
i bought this renewed but was very pleasantly surprised that it looks brand new no scratches mars or imperfections of any kind no problem authorizing it with tradfone i bought this to replace a samsung j and wish i had done it years ago i luv my pixel ii ,5
battery is just okay and im sad to have discovered dust underneath the top left and bottom left of screen just a month or so in obviously the unit was opened and not reassembled correctly but i paid half the price due to it being a refurbished unit,4
i ordered one from woot and it was totally defective all security software missingbroken so i ordered and received one from intellicell and everything is golden except they put a samsung charger in with it thats pretty shady use essential chargers,4
this is a beautiful phone no scratches no dings phone works as it should came with a crappy charger and cord but i have others also did not come with a sim card key glad i kept them from previous phones good buy though great phone,5
item was exactly as described refurb phone looked brand new came in nonoem box and included nonoem charging brick and usbc cable expected everything works great and it was shipped quickly via prime great phone,4
guys this is a good phone in  and still being supported with the latest android updates for one year more the bad side is that the generic usb c charger is too slow i recommend invest in another charger made by google like a nexus or previous pixels,4
battery doesnt last more than  hours at a time and it was received with missing parts update phone is pretty terrible dont buy refurbished from this store battery nowcdies in about  hours and the seller lacks customer service skills,1
phone came in on time but phone deffintly shows some wear on the screen with a large deep scratch on the front and the audio ports beening dirty not the most impressive for a referbished phone but so far everything works fine and came in for a good price,3
the statement of been a renewed phone had me in doubts of the cosmetic condition of the phone but this pixel is the closest to a perfect new out of the box device highly recommended from my experience,5
its amazing just like new no scratches or chips at all amazing its fast and the camera is amazing i was really really worried about buying a refurbished phone because of the reviews but i guess im a lucky person because this is a great phone,5
bought from woot deep scratch across the front glass small chips on sides and corners speaker grills and device dirty seller rating  star google pixel rating itself  stars its a great device just not from this seller and not in this condition,4
just purchased the phone it came in visibly good condition aside from a few scratches on the screen and side problem is that the phone turns itself off when left inactive so its usefulness as a phone that can take calls is greatly reduced big waste of time,1
honestly i was scared to get a refurbished phone at first my mind changed when i opened the box the phone was in excellent condition and it was less than half the price of todays flagship phone i plan on getting a second one for a family member,5
the actual usability and sleekness of this phone is fantastic the only thing i noticed was that it had a very small scuff mark in the top right corner but i wasnt expecting perfect when i bought a refurbished phone so im still very happy with it,4
only had minor scratches that were barely noticeable but the quick charging was basically nonexsistent but still charged the battery was almost new and last for an entire day bad thing is that the price  down after i bought so i paid more than i needed,4
was a little sceptical getting a refurb but the phone works perfectly when i opened the packaging the phone looked completely unused it was clean but came with generic charger but i was expecting that great product i would buy again from seller,5
charger doesnt work charging port itself is okay but obviously scratched inside and the microphone doesnt work at all the motherboard has to be replaced to fix the mic defect it is a  repair willl be returning,1
everything works as intended the phone is overall great would highly recommend this to anyone the only thing i have a problem with is speaker vibration on louder volumes the speaker vibrates the screen pretty radically,5
i was hesitant to purchase a refurbished phone but found the phone was largely flawless as received battery life screen all functionality is as a brand new phone would be very impressed by the thorough refurbishing process will update review if otherwise,5
not in the condition i was expecting screen had more fine scratches than i wouldve liked also small dents scuffs on the back plastic didnt seem cleaned too well as charging port was filthy so far has lasted though with no major issues and running fully updated,4
absolutely great quality for a refurbished the battery is a little lower than promised but not enough for me to bother using the warranty screen is clear and the ports were pretty clear very happy for this because i couldnt have afforded such a nice phone new,5
i purchased this for my husband and he loves it so much that when it is time for my phone to be replaced he is getting one for me the camera is amazing so crisp and clear battery life and charge time are superb and storage is wonderful,5
upon opening the box scratches in glass yes i can see them from  away had to scrub smudges off supplied generic charger is slow junk cable doesnt pass data not my idea of renewed well see how the phone behaves as i begin using it,3
i was leery about purchasing this with the mixed reviews but i have to say it arrived and looked brand new i swapped the sim from my old phone and it activated without issue i ended up buying another one for my mom and hers also arrived like new and has no issues,5
phone is in top shape only issue its a verizon variant i was under the impression it was the google version not the verizon since i wanted to use google fi this is a big issue for me esim fi not sim version,3
its a great camera phone and has the expected features but without a headphone jack this phone may as well be a clamshell all the headphone adapters on the market are pure trash and ive gone through  of them already the pixel  would be better than this,2
pleasantly surprised the phone is amazing it has a nice long battery and the pictures all are automatically uploaded to my google photos also has lots of great features such as handsfree text and calling,5
i received my renewed google pixel  xl and the speaker distortion is annoying supplier shouldnt send it as it is obviously damaged the renew process indicates that the phone is verified and this situation is too obvious too ignore it is fraud,1
the phone is in excellent condition but i fear the battery life may be lacking greatly for how its supposed to function also the charger that it came with is very slow i had to get a new one right away other than that the phone is beautiful and fast,4
first phone arrived and looked awesome but soon noticed that phone would not play sound through headphones thought i would try another one it arrived looking not fully cleaned and with scratches on the screen going to try ebay now,1
i received this product quickly it was wellpackaged and it works great ive had no problems with this phone after using it over a month which is more than i can say for most refurbished items ive purchased,5
i like the phone overall but in the year and  mouth it has crashed to never turn on again and lost all my information the phone i very much like google products and they make quality in all what they do in till this happened and now i am questioning,1
all in all very happy with this product compared to the samsung i owned before the camera is great and other features work great my only frustration is with turning the phone on and off seems hard to do,4
phones had fingerprints on screen one would not chargeother charged but displayed wrong time no matter what we did no istruction manualhad no idea how to use sent back for refundand bought new instead,1
battery doesnt not meet the  standard and seller wants me to ship a phone back to them when i have no phone seller also sent non oem cables and their own store brand usb a to usb c block which gives you like amp out silly dont buy from jimjam,2
turns out the whole unlocked bit is a straight up lie it is impossible to root my device because this device is not unlocked nor even capable of being so otherwise it is in wonderful condition but i am a little disappointed,3
phone looked new could not see ware or scratches was unlocked and ready to setup came in a plane white box and include all attachments charger charger cord ear phone adapter data transfer cable usb donglethey were not oem but all work and work well,5
ive only had this a few days so my opinion could change but so far i couldnt be more pleased battery life is great camera is great the phone was in good condition when i received it no complaints so far,5
the phone as an unlocked verizon phone works like a charm i did not experience any of the negative things other people have commented on phone is fast and does everything you expect it too im glad i bought it,5
so far its perfect looks feels and works like brand new and its unlocked with no verizon stuff on it super happy with it and saved a boatload of money by not getting the pixel  thanks guys keep up the good work and ill buy my next phone through you,5
i ordered a google pixel  xl and after a couple of weeks i noticed its just a google pixel  but not xl so i got cheated out around  bucks i realized because i bought a case and it was bigger than the phone can i get a refund,2
the phone looks brand new works just fine all features and specs perform as advertised it came with a generic charger and generic headphones which are useless since there is no headphone jack and no dongle ,4
phone is in mint condition and works great battery lasts a long time and it is a super fast without any bloat ware i am very happy i went with the google pixel  xl over the iphone i would also recommend this seller to all interested,5
everything i expected we bought two from two different sellers through amazon prime one worked great but the other didnt work the one from kanga didnt work and weve had the hardest time getting our money back i dont recommend ordering through kanga,5
its in perfect condition not a single scratch smudge or dirt just a heads up for anyone who doesnt clear your voicemail whenever you pop your sim inside you will get a notification for every single one lol,5
really love this phone but it came with a battery that didnt hold a charge  had to have it replaced the phone itself however is wonderful and i love it much more than the old phone i had really not happy about the price i paid for a semiworking phone though,2
in less than three weeks both screen protectors cracked without the phone being dropped just from taking in and out of pocket ive never had an issue like this with other screen protectors over the years poor quality,1
bought this to get my wife to switch from iphone to android i thought the android ui would be a hit and i was right i bought this used and it came in excellent condition the screen is responsive and bright and really nice,5
best phone in the game here i have not been happier with any phone than my pixel  this is truly the superior phone in every way i have tried and tested the top of the line samsung phones and iphone as well every other phone is far inferior in my honest opinion,5
i love the pure google experience ive been using a iphone xs max and i think i like this phone more even though its older it came in like new condition and on time im very happy with this phone and my buying experience,5
it may say refurbished but the phone i received looks new and it supports the latest android software and google fi the camera is fabulous i could not see any significant difference from my wifes pixel  which cost  more,5
bought this refurbished phone a couple of days ago the phone is ok but the camera keeps crashing and all the solutions i tried failed this is muy second pixel that has the same issue do not recommend this phones,1
shipping was prompt and securely packaged it was clean and included a charger we swapped out the sim card from our old pixel and were back in business within minutes the overall experience was easier and faster than any insurance claim i ever filed,5
didnt come with a mm to usbc dongle not manufacturer charger and doesnt rapid charge the phone thankfully i had the proper charger from my nexus p phone works great and would be a  star if all the right equipment was in the box,3
repackaged with sticky cellophane that left adhesive on back of phone and camera lenses that cant be removed finger sensor appears dirty and nothing was in box except phone no papers no chargers no headset nothing,1
metropcs initially had issues getting it added to my account but i woke up the next morning and it was working fine so if anyone is wondering it does work on metropcstmobile network  in the usa im in st louis mo,5
overall the phone looks new and for a while i was excited but the battery life sucks i end up charging this phone about  times daily if i go to bed with the battery on   next morning its about  do not buy this phone its a waste of your money,1
sorry this video is unsupported on this browser  i have completely fallen inlove with this phone it came all brand new with no single scratch or dent the battery life was at  i love this phone the packaging was also convenient delivery time was exceptional,4
the ear speaker did not have full volume and could hardly hear any of my phone calls the screen was slightly cracked when it arrived also it would not hold phone service and my phone kept going in and out of service and wouldnt read my sim card,1
battery is degraded to  after less than a month of use and baseband chip coming detached from motherboard no cellular function all at this point have reached out to seller for repair or returnrefund,2
received the phone and home button and keyboard was faulty you can get around using accessibility option but the fact that this was completely left out of the description is unacceptable returning product,1
got here on time great product but where i insert sim card its broken as in where you use the sim card opener a piece of it is missing other than that its a great product battery life could be a little better,4
phone came with a battery that had only  max capacity would hold a full charge for about  hours before it would shutdown i would think if you refurbish a phone you would replace the battery in it if it was in that poor of a condition,1
this was not simply a low cost iphone it is essentially a defective smartphone it has a glitchy digitizer screen that scrambles and does a bunch of crazy things every time i touch it so much so i cannot even use it sometimes,1
horrible service dont buy any cellphone from this seller i received a cellphone that doesnt look good and the camera doesnt work and make weird sound the only positive thing is that the cellphone arrived before it supposed to,1
we bought this product approximately five months ago about a month after we got it the calling didnt work very well as you couldnt hear with it now it doesnt even work at all the whole phone buyer beware,1
this was for my  yr old we got it on time put in the sim from his other phone and just had to call metro to get them to register the new phone it has been a week and worked perfectly so far it looked  brand new not a single scratch on it,5
phone came nicely packaged with a charger and screen protector it was unlocked and so far so good no issues with it my son loves it minus the fact he did not know he picked out the rose gold looks pink but nothing a case cant cover lol,5
my daughters phone arrived quickly upon inspection i couldnt find any dents or scratches almost perfect i popped in my t mobile sim card and so far its worked with out any issues i recommend this seller ,5
the phone real made with precision and it has the best the best camera for both photos and video and the memory to store your files is good so far so good i cant complain the smartphone is great and the battery last long,5
the phone was great and had everything that i needed for a smartphone which is why im giving it  stars however the only downside was no lte support which was very key to me this is the reason i had to return mines,3
it performs reliably and there is no what you know that gets slow and the barry life is very good and it can help you get the place where you need to be a has gps on it and anything that you need and a smart phone,5
im lucky enough to have to carry two phones iphone x and pixel xl as personal and then blackberry keyone soon to be keytwo for work pixel xl is great great features and operating system great features and runs smooth unlike samsung phones,5
phone is in awesome condition perfectly described by the seller everything also works as it should no hiccups or odd things camera is flawless overall top quality device that doesnt murder your bank account,5
the phone has such a bad battery life and the front camera is so bad always taking blurry pictures the battery never gets fullno matter how much you charge it the touchhpad seems too bad tooit doesnt respond to touch atimes,1
sturdy built and reasonably speedy phone i bought it as a navigation phone for my wife its fast enough for maps and navigation battery is great and built quality is nice why buy others when u can get nokia,5
this mobile is ok mobile in terms of speed and usage we get to quality of what we paid for the phone sometimes hang if u keep using it and some app would not open sometimes overall i fell like average phone in all terms,4
great phone for the price has all the up to date accessories that any big brand phone has it does come with its flaws first being its lack of space also this phone prob wont last very long probably only a couple more software updates then its goodbye,5
dont buy unless you really want to regret it bought it for my uncle and after using he said the phone keeps freezing and wont turn on now sad part is i can return it cause he is in africa money wasted,1
this is a very nice phone for the price and i really wanted to keep it however this phone is an international version and will not work with the us glte bands on most carriers in the us so you are stuck with a very nice g phone,4
octacore processor  gb of ram android   gb internal storage supports micro sd cards up to gb  mp front facing camera  mp rear facing camera mah battery ips hd display not bad for less than ,5
i already have this phone bought another for a friend thought it was suppose to come with a sim card no problem have one now for it she is happy with it she wanted the latest samsung no way i was going to spend a rent payment on a phone,5
loved it minus the no fingerprint i bought to replace my att blade spark pro and i ended up keeping my phone and giving this one to my husband it takes better pics than the spark but i couldnt walk away from the finger print scanner,5
i got this phone and let me you its really good this phone was a step up from a zte blade spark i had now im getting better signal quicker internet better call quality lighter handling weight just a all around good phone,5
i purchased  samsung galaxy  phones for my daughter soninlaw and grandsons two were refurbished and two were used all are working well and all are are very pleased with the features and performance very pleased with this purchase,5
box arrived empty do not purchase this it was not delivered by amazon as promised and they are refusing to refund or deliver the item again samsung galaxy s smgfds gb  gb inches lte dual sim factory ,1
after checking a few reviews i was really afraid of purchasing this phone from this seller but everything came as expected the phone works really well and its an original product happy with my purchase,5
this is my first time of using a samsung phone and i can say i am impressed with the product the battery life is super and the phone is of high quality it works well in other countries because of its ability to switch from g to g to g i give it  stars,5
nice phone but samsung makes it really difficult to root long waiting period and this international phone wont work on anything but att come on samsung i get no cdma but even international users travel,1
i bought this phone thinking its the best thing but no it is overheating whenever time i put to charge and i cant believe that i have to pay for post and it is not my fault this is the last thing i will ever buy from amazon,1
s dual sim from electrocell  fulfilled by amazon advertised as smgfds f is europe version ds is dual sim actual model received smg which is china version still has  gb storage still has dual sim,3
it is the worst phone ive ever seen the incoming calls voice sounds is really low and cant hear what the person is saying the seller is not cooperating well they used to make confused the customers even if you provide all information as they needed,1
this phone is great dual sim great design minimal factory installed options and its a sony what else can you say its fantastic not my first sony i have a penchant for buying them but this is the best so far,5
good cell phone the only issue that i had was configuring the text messages but i had to get the correct configuration from my carrier after that all worked at this time i did not test the dual sim or add it a sd card  the internal storage for now is enough to me,5
perfect size for what i was looking for and takes great pictures only issue i have with it is that from time to time the screen will lose some of its brightness and then a short time later will resume normal,5
bought for a friend she loves it she uses the face recognition to unlock the phone shes coming from j to a  so shes super excited features  design of the phone has her all up in her feelings for this phone,5
i am extremely disappointed with this device and in fact i will be seeking a reimbursement i have to be consistently calling s at least  or more times before it connects and in addition the connection is very poor ,2
everything checked out perfectly with the phone itself but i did not realize that it was not compatible with verizon carriers i went ahead and switched over to att due to this issue and now everything is working great phone itself is perfect,5
recieved in like new very good shape box is generic but you do get power supply and cable and no documentation but i didnt never use them anyways went to sprint store and they provided sim card no issues so far and i would buy another,5
recieved in like new very good shape box is generic but you do get power supply and cable and no documentation but i didnt never use them anyways went to sprint store and they provided sim card no issues so far and i would buy another,5
so far so good worth every penny verizon activated it and found nothing wrong so i am very pleased with the purchase still had protective covering and no visible wear bixby is the only problem with phone,5
i was so nervous about buying a refurbished phone i can honestly say i love this phone i used my sim card from my s and placed it in this phone and it automatically set up everything i didnt have to go to verizon,5
so far i really love it the phone was in perfect condition no visible damage operating great im a verizon user so i switched my sim card over and we were up and running in minutes shipping was prompt overall very happy with everything,5
the charging adapter the phone came with is faulty and charges the phone with fast charging enabled and  apps running in  hours from  im dissatisfied and disappointed at least include a good charger in the box or tell me to buy my own,1
ive waited a good while almost a year to write this review to make sure it was truely a great phone and it has been everything works perfectly i love this phone and the camera is great nothing has messed up whatsoever very content in my purchase thank you,5
with the exception of a few very fine scratches on the screen the phone looked new i havent ran into any issues yet but am a little concerned about battery life as it seems to drop faster than i was expecting it to,4
this was not renewed at all ordered  and both screens were scratched badly there is a sliver out of the rear glass panel and the crevices are dirty this was just turned around and resold nothing was done to renew it,1
purchased this phone for my fathers th birthday he likes this phone a lot due the size of the screen and battery life was very impressed the renewal of this phone it shows no sign of scratches or problems with the display,5
i like it it has been the nicest phone i have ever had i would purchase it again only think i do not like is the bixiby button i wish it could be removed i added a gb mirco sd card and it works great the k video recording and two cameras are amazing,5
ive only had the phone a little over a week but havent had any significant problems at first it kept telling me i needed to do a system reboot over and over i contact support and they sent me a website to go to and it fixed the problem no other complaints,5
these phones were not checked out at all there is no way you miss these kinds of defects the first phone had a dead area on the screen the second phone only vibrated when you plugged it in it wouldnt even turn on or stop vibrating until you unplugged it,1
absolutely gorgeous phone not a scratch or ding no issues with the verizon unlocked version perfect so far came with all new samsung accessories super fast shipping would definitely recommend great job to amazon too ,5
i received the phone and when i turned it on the screen kept saying moisture in the port detected i had not even had the phone for  minutes when plugged in it made a terribly loud beeping noise i was highly disappointed and returned the phone,1
i really like the large screen since it is easier for me to read the graphics quality is great and so is the camera i have had no problems with it i paid about half the price of a brand new one very happy with it,5
love this phone and the services provided by the vendor and amazon i wanted a phone that is large has quality camera and can be used with various vendors here in the states as well as where im travelling abroad for a reasonable budget and this is the one,5
this was an exceptional find phone arrived looking brand new do note i had issues using this galaxy model on pageplusturns out they cant handle the tech on about the s and upswitched to verizon prepaid and now works like a charm,5
i was very nervous buying this phone because of the reviews but what i got blew me away looks and works brand new and i was able to transfer my phone service to this phone with no issues im very happy with this purchase,5
we loaded our verizon sims in the phone and everything worked right off the bat battery life is not  of what is should be but it gets me through most of the day if i am not using the phone too heavily great value for the money,5
phone works like new no cosmetic damage whatsoever always sketchy getting a used phone but i was very pleased to find mine has no issues came with generic charger no headphones and no manual still an absolute steal for the price,5
only complaint i have is battery life when playing games or watching a movie drains quick but other than that bless the speed when using its features hasnt failed me yet highly recommend to try yourself definite buy again in the future,5
had issues with the phone itself it happens sami in customer service resolved the issue literally within minutes i couldnt be happier with the service i received would definitely feel comfortable making a purchase from them,5
i ordered two phones and they came quick and in perfect condition did not have any problems activating a verizon straight talk sims card to it i took a risk even though some reviews looked bad and it paid off best phone i ever had,5
i bought this for my lovely wife and she doesnt have any problems with this phone plus its the best phone she has gotten in a while simple to switch over just inserted sim card to phone and was ready to go,5
a value like no other i could have bought new of other than samsung for similar to the used but nothing beats the aftermarket and support of the big co reliable effective and value off the amazon nds store,5
the finger print reader and facial recognition rarely work battery life is good a basic instructional guide would have been nice the performance is very good no issues with sound signal or phone functions good value,4
the phone was my dream phone for the whole two weeks that it worked it was an upgrade from my samsung galaxy s so i was pleased with the product then the screen went white and i had to return it for a replacement,2
buyer beware item description said that it was brand new but it wasnt att wouldnt unlock it because it was used on a account with them previously think twice about ordering and dont make the same mistake i did,1
i have been using the phone for  months and i really like it finding a screen protector was difficult because of the curved screen the little gain on the curved screen i could have lived without other than that its all good,4
lasted  months before it got the black screen of death a week ago it was already an out of date model when i bought it so im not too upset about it it just pooped out at a horrible time but all in all a great phone camera is good and the phone runs fast,4
received phone box had been previously open set for att network but there was no way to turn on the mobile data making the phone useless unless hooked up to wifi i tried installing the fix from google play store but it did not work waste of time,1
i had a big concern about all of the renewal available so i purchased a new one so far fingers crossed it is running fine and i like it im hoping i dont have issues for what i paid for it so ill give it as of this feed back a thumbs up,4
received a note  from this seller in mint condition not a scratch or dent anywhere phone works perfectly was a little nervous about buying a pre owned phone online but so glad i did saved a lot of money and its practically brand new,5
it is the worst phone ive ever seen the incoming calls voice sounds is really low and cant hear what the person is saying the seller is not cooperating well they used to make confused the customers even if you provide all information as they needed,1
exactly what i wanted perfect working condition came with all the standard accessories of a brand new phone and the quality was great very nicely boxed and came with a moneyback guarantee will definitely buy from this seller again,5
especially for the priceits doing just about anything a brand new  phone is at less than half the price my buddies with brand new phones cant tell much of a difference other than the bezels and the battery will last you two days with heavy use,5
i was a little dissapointed at how many chips were in the frame of this phone around the screen i think it should have been placed in the good category or had a better description it was categorized as very good but it is not it has noticeable damage,2
when i buy a referbished products i expect the item to look and operate almost as new my phone came with cosmetic damage and obvious evidence of being used battery life also seems like it seems like its not at full capacity otherwise a great smart phone,3
originally i picked up a galaxy s active which actually broke and was replaced by this s active since i got this replacement no matter how hard its hit the ground it has survived all id recommend is a healthy stock of glass screen protectors,5
phone is as advertised and i have dropped mine a few times already and barely even a scratch honestly exactly what i need for my job the camera quality is not up to par with other models but this model is mostly for durability and it exceeds all expectations,4
para ser un equipo de gama media baja tiene un buen rendimiento en general estéticamente agradable de fácil manipulación contraste aceptable para el precio que ostenta puedo decir que es equivalente al mismo,4
my moto x pure edition finally had battery issues n the screen was showing backlight burn thru so i ordered a new moto z play with the moto mods battery bundle absolutely satisfied with the new phones performance and features,5
as a user of motorola z phones this one delivers as espected awesome processor and ram  only lack frontal flash the enlightened screen doesnt work and the finger print reader its a bit uncomfortable for big fingers,4
arrived exactly as described sans sim card but i already had one from my old phone oh i cant wait for that g mod to become relevant in my area still a solid smartphone with huge expandable external sd card slot thx,4
love this phone so far love the fingerprint reader on the side makes it so much easier interface is easy especially if you are used to moto battery life would not be impressive without the battery pack,4
the price different was probably around  for a new s i really regret trying to cheapen out for a refurbished the phone came full of scratches and was not unlocked it is not like new dont risk it,1
the title says unlocked however when i turned on the phone it said verizon and my sim card is incompatible there was also some scratches on the screen as well as the back overall i was extremely disappointed with this product will be returning,1
i was kind of nervous buying a refurbish device after taking a chance and receiving the device i am grateful i took that chance so i am posting this review to ease anyones reservation you may have my fiance love it,5
this is the best smartphone ive ever owned i did a ton of research before purchasing and im very happy with my decision no problems whatsoever ive been on the same battery charge for  days and still have  left madness,5
el teléfono celular es espectacular viene con gb de almacenamiento lo cual ayuda mucho porque las fotos al ser de excelente calidad tienen un peso relativamente grande viene desbloqueado me funcionó perfecto en usa y ahora en ecuador,5
this is simply the best phone on the market to buy right now great price magnificent battery life awesome camera and speedy finger print reader there is nothing to regret about buying such a wonderful device,5
i find it difficult to add text contacts and to end a phone call theres only one button and you have to press the power button to shut down the call annoying but overall i really like the phone and the battery life is excellent,5
this phone is especially beautiful it feels smooth and the display is big and clear especially its shooting function is easy to use with large aperture double lens the photos are particularly beautiful i like it very much,5
was very doubting about this phone but turns out this thing is a powerful underdog in its own little niche only downside is the inability to add external storage everything else is  at lowest and  at most,5
frickin awesome perhaps im overly impressed because ive only had remedial phones in the past but if this one is what a smartphone is im all in super fast super reliable i highly recommended it somehow it just feels good,5
have had it for about  months now crystal clear voice quality excellent camera results good ergonomics only thing that could have been better was if tmobile allowed wifi calling on this phone but that is a carrier issue not a huawei issue,5
best phone every batrery very good space more than enough camera great quality over all a good buy only disappoinment is that it should have used  sim but other than that its the best phone i have ever had,5
this is my first noniphone and i really really like it its fast the photos are really good i cant say theyre better than my iphone  but im still in the beginning stages of using it for my first android phone its awesome and im really happy with my purchase,5
 simplemente quedé perdidamente enamorada de mi mate  me he quedado muy satisfecha con esta marca una mezcla como de iphone con sistema android vaya estupendo se adapta bien a mis necesidades diarias batería de calidad,5
amazing phone well worth the money has lots of features battery life and camera a makes quite a few iphone owners jelly for the price using att pre paid and i get all kinds of unlimited hotspot data because the phone is unlocked amazing ,5
excellent phone still outperforms many of the iphones out there i have an iphone  for work and this mate  pro as my personal phone the mate  pro is faster on surfing the web music streaming and unlocking the phone,5
bought this to replace my nuu g this thing is amazing battery lasts all day with ease even with a lot of gaming display is absolutely gorgeous dual speakers sounds good didnt take long at all to get used to the emui skin fully recommend this to everyone,5
a great smartphone but a buggy messaging app due to an error of downloading or receiving mms occur after a security software update it looks like huaweii has abandoned the android pie update for the us variant i had to return it for a full refund,3
best phone ever i needed a new phone and i was between this one samsung note  and google pixel this is the best looking phone way better camera it works great with my wireless headphones and the blue is the best,5
i am pleased with my purchase of this cell phone the huawei mate porsche design has certainly lived up to its positive reputation it is not only a beautiful phone it functions smoothly and efficiently no lag in its software,5
the build and look quality awesome phone the display is beautiful camera is not perfect but picture come out pretty good sound on earphone are pretty good to my tastes call quality is outstanding would recommend,5
fast long lasting battery really good leica camera huawei interface in my opinion is much better compare to samsung only one advise make sure you adjust screen lock properly  or you will end up with bunch of open applications,5
hauwei wowee has a real contender to the  big names in the market love the phone  i do miss the speakers on my axon  but other than that this phone is rock solid easy  stars vrs anything else on the market,4
deje un mensaje hace unos dias diciendo que el telefono finalmente aparecio  lo dejaron en otra direccion y otro dia diferente al que me habian dicho que llegaba hasta ahora no se como seguir porque me hicieron un reembolzogracias,1
very smooth handling excellent responds when touch battery last for long long timeeven though using for a whole day received for less than a week too much surprise like it a lot highly recommended good price  thank you huawei  bye samsung phone,5
love this phone options and use is so easy and plenty of ways to customize especially in protecting privacy and limiting usage of different feature of apps this also monitors apps and alerts you of high usage of apps in the background,5
this phone has been amazing absolutely wonder photos can even take pictures of the big dipper at night its been about a year and a half since i bought this and the battery still lasts about  days of minimal use,5
very stylish and easy to use happy to tradein my iphone x which is ugly and slower with half price of iphone x huawei mate  pro is a steal have used it for more than a month and there is really nothing to complain byebye to apple,5
it doesnt work with mightytext or textto sms app huawei team has not responded to this problem  days after seeking help also default app for sms is getting changed every time you install the android update,3
it would be a great phone if the bluetooth was not so abismal compared to samsung galaxy or iphone it simply takes several minutes and tries to have it connected to cars or wireless headphones for the money i wish i had bought a galaxy,3
simply amazing phone beautiful elegent and a real beast when it comes to performance if there is a true iphone killer out there then this is it  i have mate  and just received mate  today this phone is worth every penny,5
excellent product super responsive performance the leica lens dual camera and camera app is just the best try the huaweis patented d photo its amazing my only issue is i cant find another app outside the phone to view this d photo,5
love love love this phone great battery life the technology is superior to samsung and apple it comes with a screen protector already installed i am always taking pictures and the camera quality is wonderful i have not been disappointed,5
i just got the phone and its not new the box is all scratched up and bent theres signs that the box was opened before the screen protector film is all scratched up in front and in the back so dissapponted was really excited to buy this phone,1
the best phone ive ever had fast light excellent screen the photos are spectacular the battery charge super fast and lasts all day without problems never a lag i highly recommend it to everyone the signal reception is optimal,5
phone arrived used even though the listing says its new sim ejection tool was missing factory installed films were missing minor cratches to factory screen protector phone works great but the piece of mind of having a new phone is lost,3
just came from the mate  that was the best phone i had ever owned this is a slight upgrade the only problem with the phone is the software this phone doesnt feel smooth or fluid i now have the mate  and that phone runs like night and day better,4
the best phone i had owned my last phone was honor  and it had been a great experience so i bought huaweis again the phone even comes with screen protection glass preinstalled must own to appreciate an amazing android experience no problem in using att network,5
i was a bit skeptical to buy a phone from amazon but then again they always deliver anything but then best my mate  pro is super fast really nice looking huge storage pictures are amazing on this phone love it i moved from iphone to android with this phone,5
this device is very thing and work flawless the only thing bad is this very aggressive with battery life and the notification with my smart watch have a lot delay android auto have problems too camara is awesome and video quality is good worth the money,5
much better looking in person essentially the mocha brown version performance is superb and the camera quality is excellent thank you huawei and please keep the updates coming for many years down the road,5
this is the best android i ever had it is beautiful phone with super fast finger print unlock battery that last  days with moderate used great camera i have it for over one month now and never had any problem very fast,5
what a great phone for the money i bought the mate  for my wife last year and it is a top performer this mate  pro is a top performer too it has exception cameras and just works perfectly i have not found any flaws,5
not sure if ill ever go for phones with a notch in the center whats the point this one does it all great camera great battery with easily  left at the end of a long day can i please have the earphone jack back,5
i love this phone so far super fast and the battery lasts super long coming from a samsung note  this phone is a world of a difference the look and feel and the screen resolution definitely makes it worth every dollar,5
the camera is better han iphone x for taking photos for families the touch to get focus function is very useful super fast i found free case and free screen protector after  opened the sealed brand new box,5
the phone works better than samsung in pretty much every category except google voice and android auto dont work this is enough of a deal breaker for most and i am considering returning the device for these reasons,3
my phone arrived today along with a ringke case and while opening them up i realized they are both used products no where did it state this and i paid new pricing for new equipment these are going back and i will go to my local best buy,1
photo quality is amazing the phone is fast and good looking my last phone is iphone s takes me some time to get used to the android system so far so good cons the uber app seems to have compatibility issues,5
este producto en combinación con la operadora móvil digitel en venezuela es insuperable la velocidad de carga y descarga es sorprendente jamas había visto en este país velocidades tan elevadas para el uso de internet lo recomiendo al ,5
hello really good product but somebody knows how to reset everything im trying to get access to the main menu but always ask username and password but im trying with default password and nothing i pushed the reset button and nothing,5
the manual was very poor and incomplete pay attention with default wifi password difficult to configure only  wifi channels why after configuring it the router works fine only for people with experience with this type of devices,2
absolute piece of garbage connection sucks it takes forever to connect and when it does it is as slow as a snail i tried both tmobile and att sim and both as just as crappy i am sending this junk back,1
i love this phone reviews were a bit bias but it works amazing came in a white box with an adapter usb cable and the phone runs smoothly  efficiently  month update the phone is still working effectively ive had no issues nor complaints,5
a steal arrived in perfect tip top condition not a single scratch nothing it looks brand new and the battery life is at  literally brand new condition and arrived with a charging cable and wall charger im impressed,5
the phone itself is fine it looks brand new and functions as it should it is not the phone i ordered however it was supposed to be cdma it is gsm it was supposed to be unlocked answered questions it is locked,1
theres no need to buy the iphone x for over  or even the s for  plus when you can buy the motorola g for a fraction of the price the g has all the features one could want without emptying your pocket book,5
i like the narrowness of this phone most it seems like a  screen would be bulky but this one isnt the thing i wish i xould find more of is smart cases to fit but overall i think this is a great purchase,4
estoy feliz con mi moto g es rápido tiene una cámara espectacular y excelente sonido el sistema de huella digital funciona muy bien estupendo por el precio parece un equipo de gama alta tan solo le falta un mas almacenamiento,4
love the phone upgrading from a moto g i just want to address the warranty the seller on amazon said thirty days when i contacted them but i just registered mine with motorola and for what its worth the phone comes back in warranty until july of ,5
it doesnt seem to pick up signal as well as the g play that it replaces then again i dont rate att high at all it might be the service rings loud clear calls barely notice a difference between this and an amoled screen,5
i live in the caribbean and its compatible with both of my service providersit works well and its a very sleek executive looking phone i used to love samsungbut now im hooked on my moto g this was a very good purchase i recommend it ,5
i purchased this phone to use in costa rica it worked great for a few weeks and then died i have not been able to get into contact with anyone that will provide support beware of this phone and seller,1
they claim this is unlocked and international but the sim only accepts att sim cards i am not able to use verizon this has been a very big inconvenience as att signal is very poor in my area and cost more than their competitors,1
i love this phone best  ever spent its fast sleek and all the kids at work dont even notice it isnt a major brand hehehe the only thing i recommend is a case you wouldnt want to chance ruining the pretty edges,5
moto g screen is really nice with p and over ppi together with turbor charger so its ma battery is not real problem you can get full charged within  hours it is like one middle end phone but with low price i like it thanks amazon,5
battery expanded and almost blow up my house motorola refused to honor its warranty and try to blame the damage on me even though they glued the battery into the device which made it useless after it expanded,1
the phone is made of glass back and all the glass back f the phone is like shattered from putting it in my back pocket why would a phone have more glass on it than it needs it lasted about  months the phone still works but i would not advise anyone to buy it,1
so far this has been a good product buy and performing satisfactorily a big upscale from my moto g the only issue is that some of the instructions comes up in what appears to be spanish it would be appreciated if it was all english or with english translation,4
i just love this phone great features and plenty of storage love love love the fingerprint reader feature so much more convenient than having to enter passwords all the time very pleasantly surprised at the number of apps for which i can use this feature,5
actually changing to the android system is not easy so i do not yet have the sense of full use phone seems fast battery seems to go and go and charge quickly it will take some time to get everything in order,5
i am not at all tech savy so a lot of the features are greek to me also the manual is in spanish so it makes it impossible to learn how to use it except by trial and error what little i have learned is okay i like this phone but i wish i had a manual in english,4
i dont know why but the  phones we got just didnt work good after a couple months compared to the g i had before these i was able to get money back and they were very good to work with to get the refund i wouldnt buy the g again unless it totally was on trial,1
no complaints not sure why people spent so much on iphones etc i have always had android smartphones and i really just like the moto g models everytime i am due for an upgrade i get the newest version and i am never disappointed,5
great phone im delighted for buying it exceeds all expectations nothing less than galaxy s or iphone  i had before or in current usage from my work the price little under  hundred makes it a desired  dream deal,5
items description and subject line are not for use in usa these devices are for latin america not north american and the lte bands in the description are wrong device is not compatible with the lte bands listed,1
speaker phone is tooo low call voice is very less audible phased lot of problems while talking on this phone wifi disconnects frequently inspite of doing factory reset and other suggestions by moto customer care it did not work so returning,1
i love this phone standard android great hardware features acceptable display cheap a perfect daytoday phone that i dont fret about if i lost it it would not be the end of the world this version dual sim larger display is best,5
so far so good the phone actually arrived early however the sim tray is bent which led me to think the product isnt brand new as labeled and definitely priced as other than that ive had no issues with it,4
this phone has been great good quality front  back cameras lots of storage space really fast touch response time no lagging no fancy bells and whistles but thats why i love it simple but excellent,5
for under  this phone is amazing if you are in need of a budget phone this one is definitely the king blurring the line between budget and mid range i highly recommend ive had this phone since november and it still works fine as well,4
excelente teléfono es rápido y la batería le dura bastante muy bueno en comparación a la versión anterior que no me gustó para nada la cámara es muy buena aunque no sea la de un iphone igual toma buenas fotos,5
i really like the phone only problems are when system updates come they are in spanish they dont translate to english also i am not totally sure my phone is registered for the warranty ive tried several times bit the motorola keeps looping to beginning,4
possibly the best phone for the buck now i could notice small lags every now and then but nothing that would make me pull my hair out best battery life i got is close to  days with moderate use and worst  day with over abuse overall a great phone,4
have had this phone for only a few months but so far am very pleased battery life is excellent its super fast and takes good pictures i got it to replace an alcatel idol which was filled will glitches,5
i was using a galaxy note and a galaxy s for the past  years i like the feel of this phone it has a heftsturdiness the samsung always felt like it would snap if i sat on it the screen is sharp and functions are easy to use definitely recommended,5
this is the worst phone i have ever bought i used to be a big fan of motorola but not anymore the phone shuts off unexpectedly it take too long to reboot too long to charge and does not support wireless charging face recognition is a lie,1
phone is good for a back up great battery life has glitches tho some important like alarm works one day not the next notifications then they stop things like that worth the  for battery not really a daily driver tho,3
it is an incredible phone i love games music taking selfies and chatting with my friends this is so perfect to me the fingerprint its pretty useful too buy it without doubts note the phone is pretty big,5
battery life is good fast charging do not like the photo gallery unable to hide photos and nothing for notes if your use to an lg or samsung you might be disappointing but for me battery life might make up for it,5
interenational phone is garbage  motorola wont support the phone because it is not a us based phone what garbage  be careful with purchases as this is not a simple fix phone worked for  days but the last  days was very spotty with issues,1
this phone shows difficulties running basic apps for example the amazon app freezescrashes all the time if you can get past that it is a fine phone with superb battery life and other nice features but for me it is a pass,2
i love this phone i have verizon prepaid so phone choices are limited battery life is amazing screen is brilliant great sound quality plenty memory it is heavier  thicker than my last prepaid phone but its ok because its a much better phone,5
why make an hd phone in  i had moto g  an  before and they were great the display on this model is awful seems motorola is following samsung steps and making different models with same name its a shame,2
this is the second phone we have had the first arrived unlocked we spent quite a bit of time with customer service at the verizon store and they swore it would work on the verizon network it does not it is not a cdma phone,4
more than i expected for the price the camera is amazing night time photography is great quality features are great so far easy to use fingerprint reader is a neat feature i never used before very convenient,5
this phone is pretty good it has g of ram and g of internal you can use dual sim card or one sim card and a micro sd card and the camera take pretty good pictures best think about the phone is that is factory unlock it can be use in any phone services,4
do not buy this phone months ago they released an update that broke the camera for many users physically broke the camera requiring you to send it in at your shipping cost even when on your warranty to replace the camera module,1
pros quick response great battery life loud speakers decent amount of storage cons sound quality not the best i get lots of complaints about receiver not being able to hear me when i use the speaker for calls,3
ive been a fan of asus phones for a while now love the size presentation camera memory onboard storage i can keep going worth lots more than the price only con ive seen is that the base brightness is looow,5
great phone works just fine with tmobile in my area nonrural pnw usa it lacks some modern day features  waterproof comes to mind  but it performs so well and seems pretty inexpensive that i dont let that affect my opinion of its awesomeness,5
for the price it is good for a phone i used it for one week and after that it doesnt work cant read sim card blocked the wifi and cant do nothing with it for a phone is cheap for a paper weight its expensive,1
i really love the elegant design and premium quality of screen and other components specs are high end all on this phone is high end except price this is a must have buy this and save money you wont regret,5
best phone i ever had the sound is fantastic it can get a little frustrating when switching out from the headphone jack in resets the volume level on some apps like tidal but its nothing to cry over awesome phone works great with spotify,5
for this price this is the best phone you can get high resolution instant finger and face unlock smooth application experience and lots of customized functions as well the only downside i can think of is that it is  gb not  gb great phone for sure,5
its a beautiful device and a good quality for the price one but big issue is that it wont receive calls and text when on charge and after charging it has to be restarted to receive calls and text otherwise you wont get reached at all,3
this was not advertised correctly took it into the store to get a plan put on it and its not unlocked cant do anything with it until i figure it who the carrier is because once again its not unlocked,1
literally doesnt work as a phone wont let calls go through if connected to g but if your not connected to g you wont be able to make calls also randomly decides stuff like no longer showing notifications for emails what important work email,1
i c why they have a headphone jack on a newer device its because the bluetooth stops working about a month in while using the device i seen other reviews about it not working but assumed it was only with a few phones but seems like its a big issue dnt buy,2
in my opinion hauwei is a high quality phone at a great price its easy to use and just as good as the higher priced phones i get high quality pictures and easy access to the internet i liked mine well enough that i bought one for my dad also,5
i got this phone over a month ago and it stop working properly like i stop receiving calls or it doesnt show any missing calls from my contacts how can i send it back or been replaced refund i really need a phone,2
i bought this phone for making android apps and it was a great product as a developer starter it runs fast and the display is great touch the camera is a not so good but it captures with clarity and the audio is great the chip of the phone is very fast,5
lots of people love blowing tons of money on a phone when something like this would work just as well for the price this phone has served me very well for about a year now do yourself a favor and buy phones like this and avoid paying exorbitant phone prices,5
this phone was for my wifeshe loves takeing pictures of the hummingbird family she feedssquirrelschipmunks ectthis phone takes amazing picsit multy tasks quickly and is all around great at this pricecouldnt be more satisfied nice job huawei,5
i love this phone its great for how little it costs in my opinion it destroys the apple brand and is up there with samsung processor could be faster but for being a budget phone it works very well and im no photographer but the camera seems great to me,5
i like it so far its been like  days the build is awesome very premium yet durable i think its gorrila glass im using metro by tmobile in the u s no problems it has a few cool features big ticket flagship dont have and its so pretty,4
some of this phones features may be nice  however group texting is not a feature this fact needs to be clearly displayed we bought this phone for our daughter for christmas and without ability to group text it renders it useless for her and probably many others,1
great great great phone so many great features that the iphone has my husband says over and over that this phone copied all i phones features i love the screen shot that allows the scrolling and the time lapse on the camera moving photos and thats just a few,5
honestly i expected less this phone is awesome the battery life is good and customization is really cool the only downside is the camera is not the best one but it works good enough for me the phone is a solid  starts out of ,5
i like basically everything and with the hisuite i can even delete the default apps and thats really cool the only thing is that its too slippery so you need to watch out where you put because it may slip and fall,5
i bought this for my  year old sons birthday its his first phone but he is pretty tech savvy he loves the phone excellent phone for the money no complaints on the typical weak points of lowmid range phones like battery camera or anything else,5
awesome phone for the price its at the fingerprint scanner was one of the fastest ive ever seen screen brightness isnt as good as others but that lets battery life last real long the cameras arent the best either but for cameras quality i recommend the p pro,4
absolutely amazing for its price yes this phone works great on metropcs when you get the phone make sure you change your apn settings to metros so you have not problems with receiving and send messages phone came in great condition with no packaging problems,5
the phone was shipped quickly and as described a couple months in and i love this phone especially for the price does everything those k phones do for less than half the price its also a smaller phone which i prefer,5
the phone is actually better than what i thought it would be i give it four stars because every once and then somewhat rarely the phone freezes for about  seconds other than that i dont have any complains the phones camera is really good and it feels fast,4
muy pero muy bonito con todas las funciones solo que me enteré después de que lo compre que ya esta descontinuado y q posiblemente ya no encuentre los accesorios o partes si es q un día las necesito para ese celular,4
well made i love the color the screen is beautiful and crisp the phone is very comfortable in the hand i went into a att store and the employees all made a big deal about it the only thing i wish it had is wireless charging this is such a awesome phone,5
operates well has really good battery life and charges fairly quickly and you are able to change a lot of the settings to match your preferences which is nice for those picky people out there in the world,5
when i got this product it came outta the package broken bottom left corner of the screen as it reaches the middle and towards the right side of the screen the phone isgreat in picture quality but the shipping needs work with in the package and driving,5
the battery life is really bad and the face recognition isnt great but every thing else works pretty good overall id recommend just spending the extra money and getting the mate  instead i wish i did,4
i am unhappy amazon i got this phone smiling and after a day already crying phone is already malfunctioning i am pissed cause this is suppose to be a new phone and i spent my hard earned money on this phone smh,1
so close to being awesome but my bluetooth headset would constantly disconnect during phone calls very frustrating and a weirdannoying kind of problem that can not be fixed easily at all otherwise its such a tough phone to beat even for twice the money,4
totally awesome blows away the iphone super fast great price bought this when my iphone was in for repair got iphone back put the sim back in iphone for about  minutes boring went back to the p and sold the iphone,5
it should have  skits because i have  sims and the memory is not enough and i cant use it with a memory card the material its made of is very thin and the color is fading out but i love my phone overall,4
ive search for a gift for my sister almost a week before i decided to buy this phone i was a little bit sceptical because its kind of cheap for the amazing way it looks but i can say that shes very happy with the phone she got looks awesome and it works flowless,5
i received the product fast it is the best phone at this price point the battery last  days the selfie pictures are amazing the phone fits in the palm of your hand the screen size and quality is great,5
bad company buying a huawei device now is pointless now that you cant unlock the bootloader so i basically own a p with a horrible rom and no root plus its not klein blue yves klein would spit on this phone,1
every thing worked great until a pink line showed up across the screen not worth the price it only worked well for  weeks before the screen was messed up i never dropped or wet it bought the honor instead worth it,3
the picture quality of this phone is very beautiful and the os works pretty good for an android in na its seems to have a problems with incoming calls for me for  its not a bad deal but with that being said i would rather save up and have a better phone,3
i made the switch back to android after reading a review of this phone and im glad i made the switch the camera quality is way better then any iphone plus its just user friendly the security features are great as well make the switch,5
skeptical at first because a lot reported the phone is missing in the boz but i got mine complete all accesories and was all secured i got the pink one and its pretty im gonna give this as a gift to my moms bday so far i like the features,5
this was purchased by a friend who was visiting from belgium he was replacing a old version as a gift for his mom and the pricing in the us was half of what he would have paid in europe he was extremely pleased,5
i really like this phone i thought i would truly miss my s but this has been ok except the bluetooth leaves a lot to be desired dodgy worth my echo and total lacking in my vw also a very loud electronic sound can be heard when connecting to a call,4
i love huawei but this phone ball dropped doesnt even have dual band wifi you can get the p lite for cheaper and is better and older this phones processor is way out of date but thanks for the loaner,1
i really liked this phone i was using it with metro pcs and i had to get rid of it as it was missing phone calls and not receiving all texts not sure why this was if it works good on your carrier its a great low priced phone,3
i bought this phone for my wife i was skeptical by comparing the price vs the specifications my wife loves it it is pretty fast nice storage capacity the pictures look great the screen image is awesome in other words awesome product for the price,5
bought this after i broke my samsung galaxy s edge and i dont think i will regret doing so amazing phone luxurious slim fast with many real nice features and looks like an iphone x but only for  it was a nice upgrade,5
for  this has some neat features but completely lacks speed apps like snapchat and instagram will glitch while shooting or editing videos for  i expected more considering the s is currently only  more than the p lite,3
i am not sure if it is because it is a renew phone my previous phone was google nexus but the call quality on this phone is really poor i am going to give it another week but i am seriously thinking of returning it,2
all in all its a great phone i definitely prefer the xl over the regular pixel  i do wish it had come with an adapter for charging port for my headphones but switching to bluetooth headphones fixed that issue,4
the phone was packaged nicely and phone was in excellent condition phone was gsm unlocked which made it very easy to set my service up on it metropcs only thing i didnt like was it did not come with headphones still  stars tho,5
this product is falsely labeled as unlocked its been  weeks since i informed that the phone was still locked and all i get are excuses plus the phone came in a really bad condition so many scratches you can see them very clearly,1
really nice phone small minor scuffing by the power button but its in excellent shape worked great going from older iphone se on tmobile took out sim card and put in new device and worked automatically,5
estéticamente perfecto funcionó de la mejor manera pocos días y pero luego no reconocía ninguna red móvil hice el reclamo y la devolución y recibí a los pocos días un reembolso completo sin objeciones vendedor  recomendable,5
simply amazing everything working perfectly including the charger that is shipped with the phone couldnt be happier spending so much money online made me nervous of a scam but luckily this product was delivered as advertised no visible scratches it looks new,5
i ordered the space grey gb iphone x i got and it is damn near mint no marks no scratches even tho it was still on ios  i did upgrade it to ios r i upgraded from a s and im pleased with the peice of mind from amazon and not taking a gamble on ebay,5
i can say its one of the best phone it really look like new though no headphone but it came with charger  and its pretty new no scratches whatsoever thanks to the seller o recommend this seller for the best phone however,5
the iphone i received is in prestine condition and even came with a screen protector already installed not a single scratch or scuff mark anywhere on the phone literally is a brand new phone battery life is at  im extremely happy,5
i have just received this product and i was excited until i noticed a large   inch crack on the screen i have hesitated to turn it on as i am in the process of requesting a return this review will remain at  stars until i receive a refund or replacement,2
as soon as i took it out of the box it wouldnt turn on it didnt have any scratches or anything but it simply wouldnt charge and therefore couldnt use it i was very dissapointed because it had such great reviews and i waited so long to receive it,1
the phone is an upgrade from my last one and the storage is great but when i received my phone i noticed scratches on the screen no big deal but then i realized they were cracks on the screen and not just scratches highly disappointed,1
the phone is working great and didnt come with any scratches or anything wrong with it everything works well and the battery life is great lasts all day and the company the phone is from is a recycling company so they take phones and fix them there was no problems,5
this phone was manufactured for japan so you cant turn off the camera shutter sound very loud and very annoying i never would have bought this phone if id known this there is nothing in description that discloses this info,1
i was a little leery after reading some of the negative reviews i bought this phone for my daughter and it works great no issues at all and it looks brand new it was about  cheaper than a new one shipped fast too as i received it the next day,5
i like it a lot but it seems to be running into a little trouble following my directions and ive lost the voicesound on a couple of the applications i didnt think i would need to have it tune up so soon after i got it  but over all i pretty happy with it ,3
i like this phone a lot doesnt even have a scratch on it im very satisfied with it i read the reviews on the seller and thats why i went with this seller they spoke the truth so far i think i got a good deal,5
i am completeley amazed by how new the phone looks everyting works perfect the phone has no scratches neither does the screen and it even arrived with a glass protector on the screen i am very satisfied with my purchase thank you,5
this phone is great and although it says that it is gsm unlocked my carrier said the phone is somehow not compatible with it my company is sprint i dont understand gsm unlocked should mean that that its able to connect to my provider no,5
my phone arrived quickly and seems to be almost brand new i could not find any small scratches or sign of exterior wear the battery life is incredible i have had the phone for a couple of months now and have not had a single problem,5
easy sim swap took the phone to an apple store and it passed their diagnostics test very good price only problem is that it came with an unofficial charger cable and no headphones but that was expected,5
removed the screen protector that the seller had put on it and found out about the poor state of the screen refurbished means that product has been renewedso a screen without scratches would have been much appreciated seriously,1
this device is unusable for me because the oled pwm pulse width modulation causes headaches and eye strain the lack of fingerprint sensor became a dealbreaker for me as the swiping gestures are high friction effort and dont register consistently i returned mine,1
the phone arrived three day early this phone is beautiful and flawless battery life is more than i expected phone works perfectly i had to contact customer service through email and they responded to my questions immediately,5
all the bells  whistles for half the price of a new one came with a screen protector on it   battery health couldnt have done better anywhere completely unlocked  ready to rock faceid works flawlessly  so did everything else as advertised,5
i have the iphone se but wanted to update so i reviewed all the iphones and found the ten to be the best for the price after using it for a few months i made the right choice i love it and it pairs perfectly with my apple watch,5
battery life has not impressed but ive only had it for two days maybe that will change  i did not get what was described a gb ram gb of storage instead i got  gb with  gn storage id say that was a very welcome free upgrade thanks,4
ive been a long time one plus fan im so glad i finally got one doesnt have the best battery in the world but that flaw is taken care of by its super fast charging the a actually came with oxygen os,5
bought this for my mom for christmas she loves it and wont quit telling everyone how nice it is battery life is pretty great camera could be better but for the price is still very good overall very nice phone,5
a lot of great things with the phone great screendecent battery life okay camera and its very fast and responsive however speaker is distorted and unclear when volume is at max and easy to block but its an overall great phone highly recommend it,5
fast beautiful and feels steady good battery life with super fast charging speed the oxygenos  is just amazing its userfriendly and the navigation gestures work smoothly so far i really like my new phone,5
this phone is the worst ever i ordered it as a gift to my mothers birthday she cant stand how slow it is she would literally try launching an app and go do something around the house and come back and find that its still loading such a mess and so embarrassing,1
the company secretary needed a new phone so we purchased this one and so far he loves it not sure about the fingerprint reader but he loves the long battery life and the ease of use well probably never get that thing back,4
i like this phone i charge the battery with the power off  seems to take a better charge i use it mostly for calls text and camera which is simple to set up i may turn off google because dont seem to need it i am glad i bought it,5
nice design for the low end android phone little bit sluggish as expected due to slow cpu if you just want to use the phone for calling friends gps navigation email and basic camera it does the job beautifully,4
worked great out of the box on att had to call to get visual voicemail to work call soundquality is excellent with a stronger signal than my iphone se screen is good slow to charge and probably not for a power user but very capable and great value for the price,4
we pre ordered it felt like forever waiting we revived the phones quickly after they were released within a couple days they come with all the stuff  charger  ear buds etc they do come charged woot awesome phone,5
upgrading from old phone with android  to this new one with android  only use for text email web browsing and videos so not a power user add a microsd card and this phone works great at a low cost,4
this product only lasted  month it has completely gone defective the mobile repair expert says it can not be repaired it does not turn on we tried everything to fix it this is very unfair that it only lasted  month,1
i really love the nokia   ive had many flagship phones but im pleasantly surprised with the quality it feels great in my hand its beautiful to look at and the performance is amazing i can recommend this to everyone i prefer it over my moto g plus,5
i use my nokia  for all my communication  no more landline  its a fantastic smartphone  an excellent camera  and its unlocked so it works excellent on my consumer cellular network thanks amazon and thank you nokia for really wonderful smartphone ,5
bought this for my son and he loves this phone he wanted a smaller smart phone and this was what he chose he reports on problems and truly liked the colors of it hence his using a clear case lifes good,5
the pie update android  just made this a decent phone wouldnt have suggested this phone to anyone before but now yes yes i would very very good looking phone shame to put a case on it now has the performance to match,4
stupid fast only needs charged once every  hours with heavy use k display is amazing and the fingerprint ready does its job even when my fingertips are dirty the remote play for ps is also smooth whenever i use it,5
when i received the phone it looked brand new my old s had a perforated sim in it so i just snapped the sim out and installed it in the new s along with my old sd card started the new phone and everything came back from my old phone very happy with this purchase,5
not sure if all phones from this model are the same but mine constantly keeps asking to update the phone also it occasionally freezes which is a bit frustrating i bought the phone for its picture resolution i can say that it is not bad,4
a fantastic phone had no lines or scratches the only thing i can complain about would be that i cant seem to do the software update so if anyone has an answer for that let me know overall it was well worth the money,4
i really like this phone it takes great pictures  battery life is good the only bad thing was the phone came with a crack on the screen definitely buy a screen protector my daughter dropped the phone once and it cracked in two places,5
muy contenta con mi compra aunque llevo poco tiempo usándolo me ha funcionado muy bien en usa es un teléfono no muy grande me funcionan bien las aplicaciones y el internet su batería es duradera tiene muy buena señal,5
we have the phone for a month the phone is large but not too large it is slim and light the screen has a crisp color quality to it the sound quality is excellent the battery is small but lives through the day excellent quality and best bung for the buck ever,5
this model has big wifi issues the wifi signal suddenly drops down the internet speed is so slow that you cant navigate in any website look in google and you will know that this issue is a very common one,1
great phone for its value i got the latest android pie update the second i started the phone looks great and battery last long enough with medium daily use fast enough for most of the apps in the market i have not used it for games yet,5
nice bright screen fast and responsive okay camera on a phone for  battery life is the only issue but even in that catagory its still average just a little lacking fits good in my hands no complaints at the price at  it does everything good,5
everything you could ask for in a mid range phone amazing camera even in low light great battery life and charges fast i took the blue which is beautiful lightweight came with charger us adapter headphone jack plug in free case,5
phone was in reset boot loop when received had to open the phone and short pins to enter edl mode this sounds easy but it wasnt took me several weeks to use and went to three different tecs could not return because i shipped it to my us po box and i live in mx,1
i bought thisfor my wife and she absolutely loves it it meets all of her needs she said its fast responsive connects easily to wifi bluetooth etc the screen is large withgreat picture quality overall just a great phone,5
i love this it came with android  but was upgrade able to android  i wish i could use an micro sd card with it but i solve that problem by buying a usb c micro sd reader and i also brought a usb c head phones,5
the phone is great for the priceit blows most  dollar phones away the feel is great screen size is goodits very fast and smooth and the battery is actually really goodyouy thru a whole day just finelast but not leastandroidoneneed i say morepeace,5
al principio todo maravilloso luego vino la fatídica actualización de febrero que dejó el teléfono muerto allí empezó todo una serie de contratiempos ya que la empresa no tiene soporte en estados unidos tuve que tramitar varias veces el reembolso por amazon,1
this phone is outstanding i cant say enough about it dont let the low price fool you its like a  phone love the fact that its android one immediately updated to android  when i turned it on for the first time,5
i would give this  stars if i could worked for a few weeks and then just died have tried every kind of charger to charge it and nothing works we cannot charge it enough to wipe it and now dont know what to do stuck with a piece of garbage phone that wont turn on,1
kept saying installation error when trying to run otc security updates returned and bought another on ebay that updated fine battery life is mediocre and the screen brightness suffers in direct sunlight but a value for money in all other regards,3
no complaints so far its not full of bloatware which is nice since it doesnt have the largest memory its pretty customizable decent phone havent used the fingerprint scanner thats not something im into,5
i love the phone but after weeks i stop receiving texts i can still send out texts messages but i cannot receive any i have been on the phone with support for  days trying to have the problem fix and still working on it last,3
i reset my mi a lite because it was going a little slow when tried to turn it back on it kept flashing the android one screen but was never able to boot up fast boot did not work either my mia lite was not modified in any way,1
i ordered it twice and both times it didnt works the phone is really good phone but after i open it starts to update the os and after finishing updating it crashed by it self both time this is because of the android one there is a problem with update,1
i purchased the phone in may and now when someone calls me i am unable to answer as the screen goes blank and i just have to wait for the call to ring out and then view my missed calls to see who was calling me other than this the phone was okay,2
muy buenas noches no sabría decirle si por este medio podría colocar el reclamo de dicho teléfono que no me fue entregado a mi dirección el día que correspondía hasta los momentos no he obtenido ningún tipo de respuesta muchas gracias,2
elegí este teléfono por recomendación de xataka dicen que es el mejor en la relación calidadprecio por debajo de los  y es cierto me parece muy bueno hace un mes que lo tengo y no le encuentro ningún problema me preocupaba la batería pero dura un día completo,5
the phones app crash so often the major problem i found was regarding the volume of either videos or calls resetting the phone or updating the system and apps did not help the system is very slow and apps often respond very slowly,1
fingerprint scanner will start acting up battery goes dead too fast no updates or slow updates after a year still havent seen anything about android  i dont see myself buying another xiaomi product again,2
lo recomiendo al precio que se lo vende es un excelente producto y con el tiempo sigue bajando potente elegante ligero la pantalla tiene buen brillo tiene buen sonido y es estupendo que tiene android one,5

phone broken after  months will not come out of safe mode nokia said they would fix it under warranty sent it to them and now they say its not repairable and they wont replace it waste of money do not purchase,1
i like this phone im extremely happy with the build quality the screen the speed and responsiveness of the system it even has pretty darn goodbattery life is lot better than any fun ive had recently said thats good thank the chip helps with that,5
excellent phone shipped promptly and received with no problems came in brand new box from nokia phone is exactly as advertised the phone itself is excellent and a seriously good deal with its featureset androidone and price,5
great device i bought this phone because of android one and the chip capability android auto works solid screen resolution really surprised me its important to do some research about carriers frecuencies before buying any phone,5
my wife loved this phone until it stopped charging after the th month and apparently it only has a  month warranty so were out several hundred dollars im looking into getting it serviced by nokia but im sure that will be a couple of hundred i am not to happy,2
have had this phone for about  months no complaints that i wasnt already aware of if i had to do it again i might reconsider the narrow  aspect ratio as my eyes arent what they used to be and pinch to zoom in portrait is a bit narrow so  happy,5
if you like it when your phone suddenly stops working after a handful of months return it and the same thing happens not once but three times than this is the phone for you seriously do not get this phone just buy a last generation samsung,1
if you are looking for an allround phone for day to day activities light gaming and prefer stock android at mid range price then look no beyond nokia  sturdy build only wrinkle being back is scratch prone so a case is must overall great job nokia,4
i dont care what the reviews say do not purchase this phone they are defective and nokia knows yet still have not pulled them from the market the charging port gives out like after a few months or even sooner of using it rendering the phone useless,1
i m a user of this phonethis is the price worthy phone everything thing is good but i currently i facing the problem like wifi network connected with phone is fluctuating while calling in messengerthere is no any problem with wifi signal dont know what to do,4
phone is great for the price android one with no bloatware is awesome not shipping with android  isnt no big deal there are flagships shipping with android  still so no big deal i love pure android and no bloatware is terrific,4
this phone was a letdown having to switch to nexus a xl in  months performance is a major major issue it is slow and laggy camera button on the screen in the app to take photos often does not detect the finger press battery life is average at best,1
ive had my nokia for a week so far and so far so good speed its not blazing but solid camera is not the best but definitely useable battery life is decent and because of android one thankfully no bloatwear,4
usb c charge port fails dont buy this paperweight edit they refuse to honor their warranty same issue as reported by other reviews they claim water intrusion   star reviews trust us dont buy this phone or anything from nokia,1
i liked the phone feels nice in the hand performance is adequate for my use works well with tmobile became unusable after less than  month can not charge tried all cables and chargers no luck  phone issue amazon offered to replace it thanks,1
great build quality phenomenal battery life very good performance great screen nice to hold and omg it has nfc why most midrange phones include the moto g line dont have nfc is beyond me picture quality is very good as well,5
less than  month into ownership the phone stopped charging turns out the usbc connector is of subpar quality and gets loose need to send the phone in for repair  no indication how long it will take no packaging is provided and no compensation for loss of use,2
returned for refund after  days phone didnt want to charge they sent a replacement which came out of the box defective wouldnt accept sim card nokia couldnt help sent that back too and ordered another brand very dissatisfied with nokia brand,1
charging port to the phone might be causing trouble always after th month it stops charging and starts charging randomly and causing me headache have to reach the customer care team to fix it otherwise i liked the phone,3
seriously a mah battery very disappointing i looked all over for the battery size for this phone i had to go to a different page in order to search the size of the battery i would prefer to have the phone bigger and heavier in order to have a bigger battery,2
going to contact seller i have no problem with a refurbished phone but its out of warranty and the screen sensitivity is trash compared to my other note  with a broken screen not really an excuse for that,3
so far so good very nice camera i ordered  phones one came in almost perfect condition and the second one is in very good condition very small scuffs hardly noticeable a big thank you to the sellers saved a lot of cash on these,5
absolutely love this phone my favorite ive ever owned theres some features i still dont fully understand or use because i dont see the purpose i dont like bixby but the phone is great and the seller seems to be top notch zero complaints thus far,5
this replaced my previous note that almost melted through  kids i love this phone every app capability its amazing very little signs of wear  those i only noticed bc i knew it was renewed,5
for the value of the phone i really have no complaints the only thing with mine was that the s pen was not original samsung pen so it was glitchy on the screen other than that the phone is all and all a great buy considering it was a refurb,5
loved my new phone i had know issues even though my provider is att when i turn phone on the first time it read verison on the screen placed sim card in and it changed to att great working phone for the money,5
ive was really cautious about buying this phone but having this beautiful device in my hand right now makes me not regret my decision this is day two with the note  and i am loving it looks brand new honestly ill be sure to update if i find any issues with it,5
this was a gift for my husbands birthday the first one came without the speaker sound working friendly easy  quick exchange and the other one he received was perfect no problems still almost  months later,5
nice phone it was in excellent condition out of the box i didnt get to use many of the features because i was unable to connect it to my verizon account it had tmobile across the screen when you power it up,5
everyone works like its new it did have that tmobile thing pop up when you restart but its not a big deal because you can still use it if you have a different service provider i have att and it worked fine great price for something that is basically new,5
el teléfono está en excelentes condiciones lo tengo en periodo de prueba aún no me ha fallado estoy muy contento a medida que valla pasando los días seguire dando buenas noticias sobre este producto  gracias,5
its a great phone the edges are so of sensitive and theres some options like full screen mode that require you to switch things up the phone is great but theres quite a few minor inconveniences like that,5
i dont know why and tmobile doesnt know either but i am frequently having to restart the phone in order to send messages phone will work fine and send texts no problem but pretty frequently itll fail to send and ill have to restart the phone,2
athens pricing is amazing i love this product because it lasts me the whole day and i am always on my phone checking for stocks the only con about this product is not that good definitely recommend this project,5
skeptical at first about purchasing a refurbished phone but it came its legit it looks practically brand new popped my sim card right in and it works so happy with my purchase  thank you mobile stream,5
nice product just got yesterday it arrived on time it looks and feels brand new everything works i think i made the right choice with this dealer no faults as yet it came with everything it described a charger and sim ejector tool and it is unlocked awesome phone,4
only had for few days battery lasting great so far never got in and out of cell phone store to set up phone did  of these phones changed from sprint to mobile was out of tmobile store less than  minutes so far phones look great and run great,5
what i dont like about this product is there is a defect in the camera like ink or something so whenever i use the back camera there is always something on my forehead it really isnt anything major though but overall it is a great product,4
the phone is nice but the battery wont charge fast enough im not sure if its the battery or if its the charger but im a little sad because i like the phone and cant truly enjoy it it came only  percent charged im really dissapointed hopefully it gets better,2
phone worked as it should out of the box completely gsm unlocked as stated put a sim card and it worked flawlessly quality was like new mo scratches or anything its refurbished but couldnt tell it wasnt brand new awesome phone for the price,5
i bought this phone from amazon not sure of what i was gonna receive but i was shocked to get almost like a brand new phone l no scratches no nothing the battery life is  love my new phone thanks guys for keeping it cool,5
me gustó la duración de la batería todo esta muy bien lo único que tengo problemas es que se me daña de la pantalla muy fácil el protector se quebrará muy fácil ya yebo varios protectores dañados en lo demás excelente telefono,5
wonderful phone still glad i bought it screen burn in starting to occur at the nav bar and notification bar its minor and the phone is refurb so im sure its the original panel but still be ready for burn in right after you recieve it,4
i didnt really want to buy a renewed phone but for the price you cant ask for a better deal all the functions work great not to much to say about the phone or the company thank you guys looking forward to doing business again,5
amazing this phone is just incredible for the price this is a definite steal mine had noooooo sign of use at all scanner for face and fingers work great charges fast and battery lasts just incredible,5
it comes like new but its doesnt come with any of the samsung peripherals ie no akg earbuds charging brick does come with generic charger not samsungs adaptive fast charging brick and type c cable ext,4
got it and not only did the service not work at all on it there was a long crack on the back i could of lived with the crack if the service actually worked the phone without service actually was amazing,1
as i have experienced with all of my purchases i am very satisfied with my note  i did have too return the first  as i forgot too request  for my att carrier very quick turn around on my return as well as the new note ,5
this phone is notorious for its charging problems mine has had charging issues since i got it i switched from galaxy to note only to have constant problems with slow charging etc ill be going right back to the galaxy after this one dont get this phone,1
phone was perfect was like brand new no cosmetic damage and functions like it suppose to no problems had phone for  months only thing i noticed is it was an att phone and they preloaded tmobile bloatware whitch was fine for me being a tmobile customer,5
works great right out of the box and so many great features to enjoy my daughter liked it so much she bought one too really like the grey color  a nice break from black or white without being too neon,5
the fingerprint reader you have to put your finger on a couple times before it opens battery life it is not as long as i hoped it would be but it is a refurbished phone so i take what i can get i got it for a rd of a new one,5
this had mixed reviews but the one we recieved works very well my daughter lives it and hasnt complained at all about this phone she was used to an older phone and she loved the battery life on this phone,5
this is the best phone ever so in love with everything about it unbeatable price must have works great battery survives much longer storage is great stylist is on point love love love love this phone,5
the phone came in pristine condition but was locked for tmobile if it hadnt been locked id have given a higher rating if you have no issues with it being a possible random device from a random network give this a go its the best for the money by far,4
the phone is in great physical condition it has a great display wish i couldve given a  star rating but i cant use many samsung features due to the phone being rooted i wish that was in the description,3
excellent phone when it launcheduntil the updates widgets advertised no longer available horrible battery life since updates massive unintelligible gui change redundant and pointless screens in the nav tree etc,1
who wants a phone thats doesnt have a notification light there are several problems mms messaging doesnt work either i didnt see all these issues when researching this phone its a lot of trouble i wouldnt recommend this phone,1
omg amazon delivered my phone on sunday its a beautiful phone it seems to work great amazon is spoiling me now by delivering something in less than  hours on sunday for free thank you it was such a wonderful present,5
the battery charges quick and stays charged i dont have to charge it often everything works i just put my sim card in from my old phone turned it on connected it to my wifi and within  minutes it was working perfectly fine,5
loud speaker sounds great fast cpugpu the product itself has nice change of colors with different light sometimes looks gold and others some like goldpink camera quality its fair enough por the price globally its very good phone at the price of moto e,5
garbage my nokia  did not last  months it wont charge or turn on when it did work it was slow to load pages and not very responsive completely useless its not even heavy enough to be a paperweight,1
ok so i havent owned the most advanced phones thus far but i have zero complaints about this amazing phone and am very very happy with it i sold cell phones for over  years and the quality of this phone is top notch,5
great phone for the price alot of people here are neagative and i had alot of second thoughts of buying this phone i just said f it and i did and i love it and cant complain my carrier is tmobile it has lte as well,5
im so happy with this phone im with metro pcs  i wasnt sure if this phone would work on t_mobiles network i ordered anyways based on reviews and it works this phone is fast with great reception tmobilemetro compatible ,5
for what you spend on a redmi  note pro you can get something comparable with stock andriod instead of miui and better us based cell reception this device works on pretty limited g lte bands in north america make sure you do your research,3
ive only had the phone a few days but so far so good works well its very fast for the price you cant go wrong only bad thing is that it doesnt have wifi calling nor does it have a face recognition software but otherwise great phone for the price,5
the original seals are broken and the box is sealed with clear stickers so i requested a replacement when i received the second one i was very disappointed because of the same situation as the first one both of them have ever been opened i returned them,1
this phone is excellent all around on everything long lasting battery excellent screen size and real clear too just as good or better than a samsung for a quarter of the price would definitely recommend to anyone,5
entregaron a la hora que prometieron y está en perfectas condiciones el teléfono  condiciones físicas y funcionales y dejanso a un lado que es el mejor teléfono que he tenido me encanta y el precio es exelente en definitiva lo recomiendo muchísimo,5
i love this product i bought it for my  yrold boy and he loves it the battery is ok but the screen quality and finger print is the best part of the phone i do wish the screen covered the whole screen but overall happy with spending my  on this product ,5
phone is generally great unless you like using group chats idk why but not only does the builtin messaging system not support group chats but it also prevents almost all thirdparty apps from making them,3
i really like this phones usability quality display size overall functionality and look the setup was super easy and so far everything works great id purchase another phone from xiaomi without hesitation,5
i was leery about purchasing a phone from china i wonder why  turns out it was a good buy i like it very user friendly really love the dual sim i am out of the us alot so i am happy that i can use it here and in the caribbean it doesnt look cheap,5
cheap but not cheap bought it for my wife to replace her samsung phone which she had been complaining about the battery life she likes this phone and feels smug about how long her phone battery lasts definitely worth every penny,5
i am loving miui  it has some pretty cool features battery life is great and fingerprint reader is lighting fast i get decent service for att in the us including lte when it is available camera is also no slouch definitely recommend,5
llevo poco más de  meses con el teléfono y me pierde la conexión y lo tengo q reiniciar para q vuelva a coger la conexión y la batería tampoco dura lo q se supone debe duraren conclusión no se lo recomiendo a nadie,1
i really love this phone especially for the price i payed im so glad that this was an option under  its well above that its screen is impressive its a very attractive phone it runs very well and i love the fingerprint scanner i missed it on my last phone,5
phone is absolutely fabulous touch screen and screen size is amazing as mentioned in specification ram and processos are fast only thing you are not used to use bigger screen phone then you may find it difficult initially to operate this phone,5
very good phone screen might be intimidatingly big at first but its actually very thin smartphone and fits in my pocketa very well camera quality is very good and is the main reason i am sticking to xiaomi phones on top of any other brand on this price range,5
works with tmobile lte sometimes drops update  months in and love the phone even bought one for my daughter and she love it better than her iphone  pros cheap good battery cons ads  t mobile coverage,4
absolute worst phone i have ever used i always buy off brand phones and prefer them to expensive name brands however this was a complete waste of money no service drops calls hot spot was so slow it was unusable very disappointed,1
i love it it works only problems i see is cellular strength on this aint strong and it seems to fight wifi a lot screen brightness could be better for when outside other than that excellent phone would give it  out of  would purchase again,5
i have nothing bad to say about this product for the price the phone is awesome i really enjoy this phone i love the hide notch feature ill most definitely be supporting xiaomi phones again in the future,5
the phone itself is pretty good but the reception is horrible im on the same network as my previous phone but i have little to no signal in my house i hit plenty of dead spots that i never experienced with any of my old phones with the same att network,3
saved me at least  course i reimaged it to latest os silly to pay hundreds of dollars for a name oh it did work very well as stock to great battery life not sold in usa market it is hard to get a case that fits it,5
love the phone however i live in the us and the phone didnt come with an adapter to plug into i was only sent a european plug quick fix i just used my old samsung one but i feel like it should have come with the proper plug,5
the box is full of finger prints and the box seals are broken i give them a benefit of the doubt so i chose exchange instead of returning option i received again same seal broken with full of fingerprints box big disappointment,1
is a great device for the price u cant complaint about it just be sure to have a extra us chargers it comes with a european charger one note is finding glass screen protectors is hard for this device but i like it,4
arrived with  enormous chips taken out of the corners screen was badly scratched plain white box with a strip of crappy bubble wrap inside not even wrapping the phone didnt even bother turning it on it also took over  weeks to get refunded,1
this unit had multiple sections of scratches on the screen visible while the screen was on or off the battery would not hold a charge for  hours of normal use the seller should not have allowed the listing to say like new,3
you get a crappy verizon refurb the bootloader is not unlockable also the screen protector that came with it i assume they forgot to remove it was cracked and shattered to be fair it did look very nice aside from the ridiculously damaged screen protector,1
so i had the pixel  xl before this purchase and was not sure i would be all that impressed with the  but hands down this is a better phone love the wireless charging and the battery lift is much better,5
beautiful phone battery life is exactly what was expected not a scratch on the device anywhere it was as if it were brand new two weeks in and i dont foresee any issues cant beat the price and quality,5
my unit arrived and looked to be brand new only thing i noticed was some small rub marks on the bottom back edge  probably from a case the previous user had other than that its worked like a charm glad i gave the refurb route a try saved me plenty of money,5
the phone was effectively useless as a phone  it was unable to detect that a sim was present tried two different working sims but no luck will be returning it hard to imagine how this was not caught in quality control,1
i was so very excited when i bought this phone it feels like a whole new phone it didnt have any scratches and everything works well to me ive had this phone for maybe a whole month or so and its perfect the camera quality is the bomb,5
i received my phone today and in all honesty the packaging and quality of the phone is practically new everything was presented great and the seller really made the items feel as good as new there was no cracks scratches or embellishments,5
i am very pleased with my purchase it came in flawless condition this phone is unlocked and works great on att my only riff is that battery on this pixel  xl could be a tad bit better great phone otherwise,5
the device looked new with no scratches unfortunately the screen was misaligned screen brightness fluctuates constantly and the bottom speaker is blown lastly when trying to use the best feature camera it flashes to a black screen after opening the camera app,2
bought this as a replacement for my pixel xl where the battery life had disappeared love it so far use it constantly and the battery lasts all day if you dont watch many vids my only complaint is no headphone jack just bluetooth but oh well,5
ill never go back to iphone googles pixels are the most seamless slick androids you can use they dont come with a bunch of bloatware from the manufacturer and will always run perfect because its googles phone on their os,5
looked new battery efficiency at  everywas great except how long it took to arrive they said by pm and that about how long it took bought a new pixel a xl which was clearly used and it only had  battery efficiency so im happy with this,5
when my pixel  died i knew i wanted the pixel  but was having a panic attack on how i could afford it i took a chance on the refurb and was no disappointed i saved  and the phone works like new out of the box very pleased,5
i upgraded from the og pixel xl to this phone definitely worth every penny pure android with a great camera and a awesome screen battery life is average and i will miss the mm headphone jack but still worth it fast shipping,5
it has decent battery life and i know it has a fingerprint reader builtin i didnt want to use it at this point this cellphone pretty good though im a little concerned about it getting warm while charging,4
el teléfono no tiene buena respuesta táctil incluso cerrar ventanas es complicado definitivamente no funciona bien una mala compra si hubiese conocido que iba a tener esos problemas no lo hubiese comprado estoy en ecuador así que ni siquiera puedo devolverlo,1
the first one i had i had to send back second one is working great i like the stock phones from android better i have a hard time with samsung and not being able to remove their apps same problem with stock android as well but not nearly as much stuff on pixels,5
my renewed unit came with a glass screen protector installed on it which was a nice touch so far besides the battery and a notsobright screen i have no complaints im sure as time passes the device will learn my habits and become more battery efficient,5
in addition to my other phones iphone  plus and x this could be a nice backup camera seems alright and considering this iswill not be my main phone im ok with this pixel  gb for the price i paid still learning to use the androidl,5
renewed device came in perfect condition making this a great bang for the buck deal if youre in the market for an android phone with a reasonably sized screen and dont mind the lack of a headphone jack and are ok with usb type c this is a great choice,5
the phone came in great condition had an aftermarket charger and block but that is fine it is my favorite cell phone so far i may be leaving apple and samsung behind forever and staying with google from now on,5
what a great phone it actually fits in my hand and i can reach both sides of the screen with the same finger great camera quick start up had a little difficulty getting my carrier service to work at first but it was operator error,5
i love the phone except i am having an issue with a constantlyshaking camera image it seems to be a known problem with many pixel s so im very disappointed that buying a renewed phone from a reputable seller didnt screen for this issue,2
it is verizon unlocked phone which means if you are looking for unlocking bootloader this phone is not able to do it if you do not need to unlock bootloader and root your phone this phone in this price with this condition is worth to buy,3
came without a simcard tray which turns an otherwise great phone into effectively a very expensive ipod not cool not nice the phone itself is itself fantastic despite me not being able to use it as a phone,1
so far one of the best phones i ever had the camera is as good as advertised it is fast and doesnt lag nice android experience with an easy to use interface i like the size as well just right the screen is really beautiful and responsive,5
phone arrived in a white packaging box with all the accessories it looked flawless and worked without issue batteries lived up to spec and is much faster than my old s it also takes great pictures well worth the money spent,5
phone has scratches and smudges that are clearly noticeable more than  in away phone came with no instructions and lacked key accessories such as the charge adapter utterly frustrated with this purchase,2
half way though my day the mobile connection no longer works wifi works but no cell service tried doing a factory reset and all the usual troubleshooting steps sim card works in another phone sony support is nonexistent and the warranty is useless,1
so far so good the battery lasts all day and sony has some software that lets you charge it all night without damaging the battery in the long run sometimes ive gone two days in a row without having to charge it its fast and looks really good,5
this is my second xperia and i do really like the sony phones picture quality is great call volume is just a little low but nothing to complain about battery life could be better but again not something i worry too much about i would buy this phone again,5
over all im really happy with the phone and it dose everything i need my only real complaint is there is discoloration on the upper right hand part of the screen at first i just ignored it as it was small but its starting to creep down the side now,4
so far this is a very solid phone it was easy to switch over from my old phone service to my new one att does work with this phone and its surviving strong in texas heat with good battery life ill update this later in a few months time,5
el articulo llegó dañado completamente quebrado yo lo deseche pues por temor a mi salud creía era lo correcto lastimosamente no se hicieron responsables y no me quieren hacer la devolución de mi dinero,1
i thought i killed this phone sleeping in the water but it survived only missing a few pixels it has the best screen takes awesome photos  mg pixels and has been my favorite sony of all  sonys ive owned,5
phone came quickly and works great i was replacing the same brand that died on me but amazon gave me a full refund no problem i love the phone and hope this one works better and the one that failed was a fluke,5
the phone seemed great for all that it could do i had to return it due it not being compatible with verizons network additionally the verizon corporate store says that it will not be compatible in the future,4
ive had this phone a little over a month and all of a sudden it just stopped holding a charge it will charge to  and then as soon as i unplug it it dies and wont turn back on until i charge it completely again i cant even use it waste of money,1
liked speed smoothness camera and sound dislikecan be improved a little heavier than my liking sharper than it should be bottom and top edges location of fingerprint scanner unlocks while holding or moving the phone,5
why wasnt it left in my mailbox or at my front door at least the phone is working perfectly and enjoyable dont throw something like a phone place it gently on the floor or next to a door gah the nerve of those guys,3
are you looking for a slow and buggy piece of trash that constantly hangs needs to be restarted multiple times per day and requires a factory reset every three months than look no further the sony xperia xa is the phone for you,1
worked for  months and then it crashed and now it wont turn back on no light no nothing when its on charge forced restart does not work may not be the experience with everyone but this is absolute foolishness,1
purchased and received this phone  days ago and i must say i was very much disappointed basically a shock moment when i opened up the package and saw the phone was slightly wet and filled with insects along with their eggs my skin and blood literally ran cold,2
by far this phone does it all and for just over  the fingerprint reader doesnt always read the print the first time but then you just punch in your pin i have no complaints after a couple of months battery life is awesome,5
great phone battery lasts all day camera is good touch scheen is responsive and sharp good compatibility with tmobile fingerprint scanner works well i wish it was water proof great value for the cost,5
the smart charge is my favorite thing flawless phone another home run by sony i can use my phone as a hotspot start of with  and i have  left at the end of the day camera is amazing i freaking love ive this phone,5
if you are looking for something slim this is not a phone for you because the back part is rounded so it feels kind of bulky but in functionality the best one that i had im a sony user since they where sony ericsson,5
first time to buy phone with amazon with the price i would say its worth with the accessories it met my expectation actually i bought it for my friend the phone is amazing it works prefectly the way i wanted,5
youre not going to find a better phone for this price point ive had mine for a year and a half now and i bought another for my wife about six months ago if brightness is maxed out it kills the battery we keep it about  and its perfect,5
this phone is great i bought for my husband  his asus phone broke  i have an lg g and compared to minei know alot older  this phone is amazing the picture quality is so much better and clearer and the battery lasts for a long time ,5
amazon samsung could not troubleshoot i dont know why amazon is nivkle and diming me  when their product came defective locked and their team could not resolve problem i want my additional  back consider gazelle,1
bought this phone because they had a high rating tried sending an email no response that was  days ago this is a great phone but will not work on verizon it was called a verizon phone should have worked on cdma,1
i ordered this phone based on the fact that it was listed as unlocked and after receiving it checked compatibility on us cellular tmobile metro pcs and boost mobile it was not compatible with any of these carriers unlike what the seller said,1
horrible phone constantly disconnects from wifi no matter where i am i even needed to turn off my wifi and use my own data to write this review constant pop ups on screen for advertisements never saw that before do not buy,1
its perfect for me high quality screen great design takes beautiful photos more powerful wifi signal with wifi comes with a transparent case good audio good microphone and many more features im fascinated,5
this phone is worth every penny just buy it perfect camera perfect body to screen ratio great performace i even had to turn off the face recognition due every time i wanted to change a song i ended up unlocking the phone haha,5
went from using an iphone to this definitely not going back battery lasts all day even with bluetooth headphones connected most of the day screen is big enough to watch shows but not to the point it wont fit in a normal size pocket,5
i paid  and this phone is far better than most  phones it has all the features that youd expect from a far more expensive phone and the screen and options are great the battery lasts longer than any other phone that ive had,5
i love everything in this phone battery is the best camera is great and everything is perfect i have no regret buying this worth the money and i recommend this phone for the best battery life and best features,5
this phone is in everyway great my coworkers loves it more than i do the quality of the pictures taken from the cam is superb the design is splendid battery life is on point shipping and delivery was the fastest i ever seen since i have been ordering items online,5
this huawei m lite  dollars only taking great photos  fast and cool battery charging alone worth it already very smooth and fast phone indeed i work outdoors dropped  times rain still shiny new i bought a watch  and a nano card from huawei happy,5
i bought this phone as a gift and they loved it so far is been very reliable and great for everyday use of course this is a mid level phone so i wasnt expecting premium specs good thing is that it works everywhere in the world,5
awesome phone the display is spectacular brightness awesome camera quality top knotch word of advice purchase a case and temper glass when you order this because its hella slipper but awesome phone for the price you cant go wrong,4
first i buy this phone is one of my friend told me the camera is leica when i received it wont let me down  the android ststym is not too bad either just need little bit study to get used to it you will live the phone for sure,5
i upgraded from a huawei mate  and love how much lighter this phone is even though its not metal covering etc its still very durable ive dropped it many times but have a spigen phone case and screen protector especially for the price,5
it was an excellent value for the price considering other lockedcountryonly cellphones are even twice as expensive it has a very good quality screen both cameras rear and front work amazing and processing and storage capabilities surpassed my expectations,5
i got this phone because my previous phone was a huawei as well  that worked very well was totally satisfied with it but this made more happy it works really fast so for the price i can not ask for more and the camera is so profesional love the whole pack,5
cellphone performance is pretty good just the update to new emui version with some issues double check with huawei technical support it is confirmed to update emui  above i dont know why it is still not available to upgrade in the usa,3
is a great phone for example i charge every night and the next night i have  in apps like instagram youtube mail messaging calls and other apps the material quality is good and is very slim the only bad thing is the sound and the face id,5
lets just say the color blue functions and features of this phone i really like it holds charge face recognition and finger print sensor is really good one of the best features of the phone is the private space,5
i recently started using this item i have not dropped it however i am now experiencing some random restarts it has me puzzled is this a factory setting or what i need to know why is that it restarts on its own,3
this phone is worth every penny i have had it for a month now i switched from a iphone s plus cant see paying for a half my rent for a phone u get all the quality in huawei phones and the camera is better than i thought it would be battery life is great,4
cellphone is according to official websites specs the only thing that can be improved is the led light it is too weak and sometimes it does not go on when receiving a notification other than that its a great phone great camera and its really fast,5
no puedo creer que este celular se raye la pantalla con nada estoy desepcionado de la calidad material de la pantalla esta rallada por andar el el bolsillo no puedo creer que huawei venda esta gama con pantallas que se rayan con nada,1
camera quality is soso when im trying to send pictures the quality gets screwed up like majorly a clear picture will turn into pixels this also happens with screenshots i wont be able to receive some text messages from people,1
initially the mobile phone appeared really good i have to mention that it was impossible to create the huawei account and use all the huawei apps because the service is not avaialbe for the united state area very unsatisfied,1
its an excellent phone the battery is great i loved the fingerprint the battery life is amazing so far but i didnt received the charger headphones and it has a little crack i was thinking on return the product,5
the phone is great for the money the only problem i have is im not getting lte only g mbps speed evan tweaking around and going to my local att store but they couldnt figure it out its a little disappointing because the specs show att bands including lte support,4
i didnt purchase from amazon but trust me this phone is superb it has great screen quality very responsive great battery life and the finger print reader is quick this is way better than all the iphone samsung and lg phones i have used in the past,5
love the device received updates so now running android pie camera is a little disappointing tho bought with sd card bundle however i did not receive the sd card not sure if that was transport mishap cant complain too much phone is definitely value for money,4
this is my third huawei smartphone and this is so far the best in price quality and features big screen full hd esp when watching in you tube big memory so it is fast with my g att go phone battery life is crazy good i will get another one soon,5
ive owned iphone and samsung flagship phone and i would buy this phone before any other  times over this is not even their flagship phone and it is way better than any competitor definitely worth the low price in comparison,5
i like the phone byt i have  ussues and if not resolved ill be returning it one is the volume youtube music video sound is considerably low compared to samsung second not authorized for united states cant activate what should i do,3
great phone this far the sim mount i got is plastic not metal it was suggested that i should get it changed although phone box says new there was no phone manual in the box just warranty card and all the accessories this was the only strange thing i have observed,5
i just got this phone for my th birthday i am in love with it the battery life is exceptional and the camera quality is very good i love the layout and the phone was very easy to set up i recommend this phone for everyone so worth the money and the wait ,5
the phone came in great condition as far as i can see ive been using the phone for about a month now and its so far so good holds an awesome charge finger print reader is fine the speaker quality is good and the camera is great all are in good condition,5
other than a few scatches on the back and some drop dents on the side the phone works pretty well after all updates are done i noticed some pixels on the screen are waring out but it isnt noticable until i turn it on dark mode in web searches,5
my husband says its the best phone hes ever had even over the samsung s sadly couldnt add it to my plan on total wireless but ended up putting it on straight talk hes so happy with it and im happy with my purchase thank you,5
all good beside the network bandwidth if you use it in usa the most you can get is g and mostly is h which is fastest g network download and upload speed is much slower beware of this before buying this phone overall its a really nice phone,4
very easy   thank you for this powerful phone speed cpu ghz great screen hz very loud speaker  very loud mic  very strong battery life qualcomm qc   type c there is many things to say,5
i just got this phone from amazon and the screen has these annoying faint vertical lines looks like its a manufacturer defect i emailed asus but im prob better off just sending it back to amazon such an expensive phone and such a disapointment,1
everything is great except the screen quality and i broke the phone trying to replace the screen lol didnt have time to explore all other features yet screen life is too short way to short and there is no good shock proof case for rog,1
this phone has exceeded my expectations with cooling and not melting my fingers like razer  phone  i bought it after thorough research and it definitely lived up to the hype the features tweaks make up for screen only being hz,5
if you have been holding out for a phone to replace the nexus p then this is the perfect phone for you the frame rate rocks the speakers sound great and the added features are fantastic  its the google pixel you dreamed of,5
primero se reinicio mi equipo de la nada después del reinicio no volvió a trabajar tuve que hacer un hard reset después de un mes de ese error y de perder mis fotos e información mi teléfono dejo de cargar pésima construcción y materiales para un equipo tan caro,1
seller responsible excellent work and respond every question i ask  perfect condition fast shipping everything is good i recommended and the phone is best for gaming and work well with normal call messages etc,5
i have just purchased this beast yesterday i will update my review onced received  update you will not regret buying rog phone its beyond perfect and im so much enjoying usingplaying on this phone glte is working fine here at uae no issues at all,5
this retailer sells a bunch of products that will be defective within a few weeks of using on return they will convince you that nothing is wrong with it without any test results and charge you a  restocking fee,1
i love this phone there is not another phone out there that looks this good if you are into gaming it also has a beautiful amoled display at hz dual speakers air triggers and cool app support if you are into mobile gaming this is the phone to get,5
this phone is great no issues so far but it does get hot playing certain games the fan does cool your hands but not the phone itself the phone chargers very fast and you can play all mobile games at max setting with not issues,5
simply put dont buy this phone the screen on it breaks you get blamed they wont fix it your girl friend gets mad you get blamed she breaks up with you she takes your dog so if you wanna loose a  and you dog and get blamed for everything this is your phone,1
great phone overall exceptional camera performance and battery life main concern is no ability to use volte or wifi calling hope this will be add with a software update android pie this is very disappointing so too is the lack of a headphone jack,3
solid material and construction for the price point very responsive ui miui good quality phone i would call the lack of nfc scratch resistant glass and no water resistance a con however for a sub  smartphone who am i to complain,4
lots of xiaomi blote ware with no apps pocket so every app must be displayed use of any of the mi apps require that they have access to and can collect all of you personal information dont use them other than that its a great phone for the money,5
screen quality is not that good from my opinion causewhen i lay the screen down on the table it appears the scratch easily if you have no film the screen is senseless sometimes for example when i click to pause my youtube clip i cant sometimes,3
i love everything about this phone so far ive had it now for about  weeks put my sim card in and it worked right away i have cricket works great perfect size great storage love the display and the sounds id definitely like to stay with this brand for awhile,5
i believe this is one of the better phones ive owned runs very fast with allot of programs one of the best features is the ability to record calls without any special program if youre a contractor this is a great feature,5
this unit does not have face recognition feature phone lacks some features that i enjoyed in a previous redmi note x thats not good otherwise so far it works as expected pictures are decent and speed is good,5
worked fine on att no problems battery lasts over a day with moderate use one of the few problems with it is where the speakers are sometimes sound can get blocked easily and it gets muffled with them being on the bottom only,4
great buy this cell phone is definitely the best way to spend your money it has a huge screen with a great camera battery life is awesome if you are trying to get the best deal for your money get a xiaomi shipping was super fast will definitely buy again,5
very nice phone only drawback would be the camera but considering the price it is understandable i replaced my old iphone s with this phone and using it mainly as a bussines oriented tool im happy with the change,4
its a really good phone for the price is a steal comming from my now dead one plus  its ann obvious steb down but its still in the high mid tier range as i said i came from the one plus  so it cant compare in terms of speed and ui but its a great steal of a deal,4
super fast finger print scaner k video  fps slow motion video photo manual mode good quality photos from both cameras good quality sound from speaker comes with silicón case dual sim etc not good lacks of headphone jack battery is ok,5
looking for a budget phone but without the budget looking and feeling phone just pick this one as i like to say that it has an operating system like samung but better its look and feel is like apple like its amazing for what you get,5
pros excellent camera beautiful design battery survives up to h with moderate use instagram whatsapp etc fast touch id response cons i have no negative comment it is more than just for the price that is value,5
i got the phone last week liked it a lot not heavy looks solid build nice screen my colleague liked it too and asked me to order another one so bought  so far works perfect with alice and claro in dominican republic,5
this is a great phone for the price i was scared to order it because i wasnt sure it would be compatible with metropcs i was able to switch to the phone with no problems by calling customer service so glad i ordered,5
the operating system seems to work fast and fairly well the only drawback is the battery life if everything is turned on the battery will run down pretty fast i saw one guy on the web testing the battery life with the clock on this model its unbelievable,3
love the phone but my main issue is can anyone get straight talk working on this phone in us if so plz plz help with getting service ps i hve tried bootloader not working cant figure out how to get verizon off dis phone,3
excellent phone it is value of  or more the best phone in the market of  great battery life after register for sim card is g lte very fast very responding very smooth every thing is excellent i love it,5
great phone love it used all day with music at work from  to  ish come back home battery still on   now that pretty f awesome i might say dont have to bring a charger with me as well and thats if your phone is fully charged up for that day,5
muy buen teléfono la batería dura todo el día y más el problema es el tamaño no lo recomiendo para personas con manos pekeñas el telefono muy grande tiende a caerse es una maravilla me ha impresionado la camara,5
i am not ready to trust pixel now as i fell in love with nexus x and went through  boot looping phones and death and google turned their backs to invent pixel how do i move forward at least they will pay p owners google let me down with x,1
this is my third pixel device  definitely a wonderful smartphone the performance is amazing  better than other devices running android the camera is second to none and i wouldnt go back to an iphone if they were free,5
there is very bad noise disturbance via speaker as soon as you answer the phone this happens at least once a week this happens since i bought the phone tried to remedy it by taking it to repair and thought it may be my phone service but the problem still continues,2
the phone is in mint condition its beyond perfect i had to go to my provider to get it activated because my previous phone was  generations old it was worth it and i was able to transfer my data myself,5
couldnt be better so far looks new and does everything its supposed to do battery life seems phenomenal to me since my old phone died after only a few hours of use shipped quickly wellpacked just as described,5
phone looked great no scratches it turned on fine and seemed to work ok it just doesnt work with my provider but if it works for you its a great buy the packaging wasnt the best but i just reminded myself that it is used,3
the product looks brand new everthing works well i had a little issues with the texting but was able to figure it out but now my only complaint is that as soon as i did my software update it keeps on giving me notifications how do i make it stop anyone can help,4
the phone came in on time and in great condition including all the cords and chargers and even a set of earbuds the only problem is that it wasnt actually unlocked but i got a sim card pretty easily so it wasnt a big deal,3
the over all look and presentation was perfect for the phone however the internal antenna in the phone i received was bad and i had to get another new phone because i couldnt get signal anywhere other than that everything was pretty good,3
went from s to this s and it is incredible so far didnt think i would like the rounded screen this much but its awesome phone feels and acts like its brand new and ive had no issues after about a month,5
tha phone is super great i cant describe how amazing its screen performance and battery just go for it and no regret also it is great deal with this price the customer service was very helpful and fast responding,5
love it i ordered from mobiles international llc and i decided to go with the emerald green they sell ones with boe display not the ones with lg which have color distortion or the so called glue gate,4
phone came unopened and new came with us charger also so no adapters my only suggestion to anyone who is looking to purchase is to pick a vendor where the shipping is fulfilled by amazon that gives you one day shipping and a little more peace of mind,5
it was a nice phone it was long but the onehanded use was easy i think id prefer an actual fingerprint scanner vs the screen version the camera was great but the kill shot was the whole us vs china stuff that changed my mind i would have kept it otherwise,5
the finger print reader doesnt work well for fingers that are old or dry skin its hard to take my finger print on government type printers the phone was okay but for just a bit more money i can get an s or s which are much better phones,4
i bought this phone for my son he is very happy and satisfied exceeded our expectations long battery life and picture quality is very good an exceptional price for this phone it was delivered promptly and is exactly as seller described,5
i recently picked this up during the previous sale and really glad i did ive had samsung phones for many years now and dont miss them at all this phones battery life is great the photos are amazing no bloatware really happy with it,5
this phone has everything except a working call functionality there are thousands of forums talking about call quality issue google has not issued an official fix yet and it is frustrating to have a phone in  that cant place calls properly,1
the pixel  xl is a nice uograde to my nexus p the display is bigger and brighter the os and apps run quicker and smoother the camera takes beautiful pics i have had no problems whatsoever i am quite satisfied,5
i bought this phone from this seller and it came faulty wifibluetooth crashes every time tried to talk with the seller and amazon and no one is going to give me a refund or something also is verizon phone meaning you cannot unlock the bootloader,1
its as good as the review say an then some battery in battery saver mode last me all day and most of the night under regular use audible surfing and phone call recharges quickly camera is exceptional,5
i was really skeptical about buying a phone on amazon but this is legit i am in love with this phone the battery life is great and the picture quality is out of this world i have never had a phone as fast as this one either,5
once i bought it i started seeing bad press i have to disagree with the negatives so far im loving the pixel xl i am a usage hog so i do have to charge mid daybut ive had to with my other phones,5
great phone the only drawback is the tab google assistant is great fast there is really no downside to performance i will be back once they get rid of that tab went to note  for the time being and honestly in a few ways the pixal is better,4
desde que encendí el teléfono tuve problemas con la conexión wifi después de unos días simplemente se desconectaba de la red y aunque lo reiniciará o hiciera el establecimiento de fabrica el teléfono no conectaba a ninguna red wifi,1
had it for a week now and loving it considered the galaxy s but this phone with half the memory and half the ram was faster and more responsive than the s just goes to show you that you do not need to have all that bloatware to have an awesome phone,5
took the active to the sprint store and they were able to activate it had for about a month now with no issues wish i purchased after news for the s came out it looks like the price came down about  dollars,5
kind of annoying how it tries to randomly activate itself in the sprint network while i have a metro sim card in it also it drops to g data while on calls not really a problem but it will slow down browsing,5
so the phone itself is good and the camera is excellent however some of the posts about carrier support can be misleading the support of tmobile is missing a couple of bands which leads to spotty coverage on edge and g coverage areas,3
i took a leap of faith by ordering this without knowing if they gon send me a brand new one or a refurbished one but they actually sent me a brand new authentic one it also came very fast lol i am happy af  btw s camera is the bomb,5
i bought a samsung phone a year ago quite expensive it doesnt work well now its so slow and nothing downloads on it my other devices work perfectly on the wifi i will never buy anything from this buyer bad experience,1
this is my first samsung galaxy phone and i feel that this experience is great because this phone is the best smartphone on the market right now therefore i feel happy and excited to have that kind of phone,5
both phones are working excellent at the beginning we were a bit concerned of buying two phones that were supposed to be used in argentina buy now i will change them again in the same way we did it thid time,5
the front facing camera produces a failed error and does not work it is terrible to buy a new phone with this technology and be disappointed for not having all the functions working many reviews around internet naming this issue,1
works perfect in argentina with movistar in us with tmobile when i visit the us camera is incredible good so much better than the iphone  you will love it no stucks nothing strange screen is clear and big highly recommended,5
the primary reason im giving this a mediocre rating because my wife dropped hers in a case from about  feet high it fell flat on its back and never worked again im not impressed with anything that breaks this easy,2
it a really good cellphone for this price its really really fast and work awesome the only thing they must improve it screen fingerprint sensor sometimes dont work as expected and its not as fast as oneplus,5
product is not oneplus t a gb storage  gb memory factory unlocked  inch amoled display android   mirror black us version the product that is being shipped through this is oneplus a chinese and india only do not buy for cdma network,1
my lg g died and i needed a newer midrange phone the price is right and the specs are pretty good to me the camera if fantastic and gb dual sim cards and gb storage for the price is a steal very happy with phone,5
phone working great so far i am a power user and from when i leave home at  am to returning home with  pm with about  i can live with that the finger print reader is a little slow but its not a deal breaker for me,5
camera is easy to use great color and clarity delivery was earlier than promised  much appreciated set up with previous sim card went smoothly definitely a value purchase as performance matches and surpasses other big names,5
do not buy from edge cellular defective phone doesnt work looks like it was run through a wood chipper before purchase amazon refuses to replace our acknowledge that the seller is selling faulty products,1
i like that it came quick and i like the phone but what i didnt like was that the product advertising was incorrect and i received a different model that what i payed for i wish i could do something about it,1
do not buy for verizon plan reviews say it works with verizon you just have to toggle cdmaless roaming so i did that and lost almost all coverage at my home and a cabin i visit wont send sms consistently either calls drop do not buy if you are on verizon,2
oneplus is an amazing phone there might be a small issue with the battery because you are charging and discharging your phone very quickly and doing so repeatedly over the course of many days the battery might wear out very quickly,5
the charger was not original it heated up on charging the phone was in good condition everything worked like a charm the phone was previously locked to t mobile every time i restart the phone i can see t mobile intro screen load up,3
phone was unlocked i just inserted sim card did wireless transfer of data from old phone to new phone everything went great ive only had phone for few hours but everything working great so far i will update review if i have any problems,5
my lavender samsung note  phone was dead on arrival i could not get the phone to turn on after the seller approved my refund and i sent the phone back the seller did not process my refund amazon processed my refund,1
phone came very quickly packaging was okay the phone was on when i opened the box minor scratches nothing major but for the price you cant beat it very happy at the moment with this purchase will see how well it is in long run,4
my bf bought this for me because my old s was constantly dying on me the pen feature is awesome it did come unlock and setup for tmobile which is my phone company so all i had to do was change out my sim card it works really well and as expected thank you,5
i know is use phones but for the price of  it looks in a bad condition unfortunately you take a risk when you buy phones with out been able to see them and are used and i am not happy with this purchase,2
totalmente descontento con el iphone no estaba desbloqueado y no funciona para ninguna compañia es una vergüenza porque fue un engaño porque el iphone lo llevaba para otro país sino es porque me doy cuenta a tiempo,1

i was reading reviews of how it was a bad product which made me not want to purchase from here but then it came in the mail and although it didnt come with original box and charger the phone is perfect  so far i love it,5
i got this phone in june i cant be happier came in like new condition battery at a  can last over hrs of normal use i upgraded from iphone s which battery lasted merely hrs i would really recommend this phone,5
it works and performs as described the iphone is way faster than my old iphone plus although it is the exact same dimensions as the old phone except for the camera lense on the back otherwise an excellent product thanks,5
el telefono esta like new funcionamiento perfecto quizas la vida util de la bateria no es la del cel nuevo pero diria que esta al  con gran uso de redes sociales me alcanza  horas sin recargar,5
the product arrived on time the phone looked absolutely brand new it came with a charger in a box i have been using it for a week havent found a problem at all the phone is in perfect shape and does not show any problem definitely recommended,5
basically indistinguishable from a new phone had a minor hiccup with voicemail activation on verizon that was resolved by calling them doesnt come with headphones or a dongle comes with a nonoem charger and cable,5
ordered this phone upgrading from a iphone s i was worried to order from amazon to spend  on a phone like this i got the phone quickly within  days and not a scratch on it battery life is great no issues whatsoever very happy with the purchase,5
i bought one of these phones currently using it rite now and the face id does not work i shipped it to my mother in the us then and she brought it to jamaica to me so it was hard for me to send it backall im saying is test ur products properly b selling them,2
el teléfono me llego en excelentes condiciones caja cargador y cable originales pantalla perfecta rendimiento de batería genial totalmente desbloqueado para cualquier operadora no incluyen los audífonos pero eso no fue un problema para mi,5
i hesitated to buy at first as it was renewed also the comments inflicted on me but after i got the iphone it was orijinal and no signs of use was on it do not believe in the baf comments it is orijinal and i recommend to be bought that is it,5
i expected the refurbished iphone xs max to come with all items it was originally sold with the audio phones were not included this is especially annoying because only audio phones with a special plugin will work on this iphone,3
one  it comes in a weird box two it had more scuffs and scratches than id like for the price   i had to return it because of how over all lame it came and how it showed up battery was pretty warnscratches and i didnt get the awesome feeling of unboxing it,1
phone was not in as good of shape as i expected at this price point the battery life has consistently gotten worse until the point it can no longer hold charge ive contacted about a return and they have yet to offer any support,1
was nervous ordering refurbished but i cannot see any evidence it was ever touched battery shows  capacity no scratches or marks anywhere and fully unlocked tried sprint att and cricket sim and all register and operate without issue,5
i was very nervous about buying a renewed product this expensive but ive had the phone for a month or two and love it works great no problems and in great condition as far as value for the money apple will never rate high in that category for me lol,5
im really impress wasnt to sure to get an iphone from amazon  wasnt to sure what i was going to receive  but i am really happy with the phone looks beautiful and works great no problem this seller is really good wont mind buying form them again thank you,5
apple iphone xs is a great phone and the seller kept his side of the deal however when i received the phone i was not impressed due to the small screen size i have shipped it back through ups and ordered apple iphone xs max  gb instead,4
arrived today seems no problem but a really little bit of scratches on the edges but its not appear came with just charger and lightning usb after having this for  days i can tell you it was a good deal at least for me,4
phone screen was in pretty rough shape when we got it expected much more but spent  on a new screen and then found out that the phone was warped not in the condition that it was promised very disappointed will not buy from here again,1
it is almost new phone no scratches whatsoever i checked with apple and the phone was just  months old really happy with my purchase thank you it comes in generic white box and with just charger no headphones included,5
got my galaxy note  in the mail today and it was locked to sprint warning do not buy anything that is factory unlocked of has a specific carrier i have to see what the last pay of the phone is before i can use it,1
the phone has easytonavigate features and nice size unfornately i did need to return two phones due to poor signal reception which made calls and gps challenging i ended up getting a different make and model perhaps i just got two lemons,2
excellent phone basically a economic galaxy s but cheaper i got this phone for my  years old daughter and i can say that is amazing fingerprints sensorr face recognition samsung one ui good battery life good screen honest review from an s owner,5
when i received my samsung galaxy a i was very happy its a lot of phone for the price with a nice large screen and great camera mp so happy i decided to buy this phone as it was everything i expected and more thank you,5
absolutely pissed only a month in a half in and the phone went dark and wont turn back on i genuinely like the phone in itself while it worked but i sure as hell am mad about paying  for a no longer working phone,2
ordene el teléfono para estados unidos virginia  y no lo puedo acitivar con ninguna linia me dicen que el teléfono no apárese el imei y por eso no se pude activar  entonces quisiera saber cómo le ago para activarlo,1
i like the fact that gb are available thus it meets the need for those with many apps on their phone without having to purchase a high end phone i dislike that i have to go online to purchase a case for it,5
perfect midrange phone great price its worth to buy the only setback is actual the fingerprint reader hit or miss not always accurate face recognition is on point great buy for the money works great on tmobile,5
i just got this phone and like all of my other phones i charged it to  before i used it for the first time the phone literally last for only half of the day about  hours max mha should last  hours max this is insane,2

the product seems to be very good and i am very happy with it the battery life is very good my only complaint is the long shipping time i ordered it on a sunday and it should have been in by friday or saturday i didnt get it until monday,3
after downloading a few apps on the phone it got very slow it also started giving problems such as suddenly turning off not turning on or charging even after a full charge however it is a great phone for the price,3

he has very poor eyesight i heard about the phone and decided to give it a shot despite it being used it works he had it for a while he likes it very much he even brags about it that why took so long wanted to make sure he likes it he very picky,5
i like that its a usable phone for under  it could have better call quality though and the pixel a is routinely on sale for about the same price so if you can get that phone for  definitely dont even consider this one,4
would be better located on the front or side a bit hard to find without looking for it on the back i am picky and very happy to own this phone i like that it is wider than the many other brands nokia customer service online is great,4
the phone is decent the screen can lag and not respond sometimes the battery is terrible i get up at  might scroll a bit check the weather and then get ready for work by  am its already at  doing nothing,3

for the few days of use this phone has done nothing but delivered fingerprint reader is responsive and easy to access im getting almost  days of battery life with moderate use results will vary when gaming no lag so far this was a good purchase,5
touch screen is iffy sometimes it will work other times you find yourself violently tapping the screen and wanting to scream dirtx water or any substance on the phone and it wont register other than that its a good phone for the price,4

i bought this phone based on the model number listed xt believing it would be compatible with republic wireless it is not now i have to return it and buy a new phone complete product information should be listed in the description,1

i based my new phone search upon the phone being  mm or less wide the phone had to be under  still happy with the size and performance of this phone months later it is a lot of phone for under ,4
upgraded from a much simpler nonsmart phone so this phone was a big improvement in capability compared to the newest high end phones this phone may only provide  percent of the capability but at only  percent of the cost its a good value,5
i order for of these phones which came with the sim cards however all four sim cards were bad i was not able to connect any of the sim cards because they were previously activated i had to spend an extra  on sim cards,3
i bought  of these phones and both sim cards are bad rip off at least state the sim cards dont work havent even turned on phones so cant rate anything else i should have read all the reviews do not buy,1
im a sahm and my toddler constantly uses my phone he obviously throws its spills stuff in it etc  so far its not broken yet i love this phone its cheap good quality and perfect for everyday use plus didbi say how cheap it is,5
at the third month of use the screen stopped working correctly sometimes the touch works well and sometimes it does not work and contacted the xperia technical service but it seems that they do not have the proper care with their customers,1
this smartphone fits well in my hand and yet is super long we love reading books on amazon kindle on this phone everything installed super fast and runs super fast it has a long battery life the screen is super sharp it is very responsive i love this phone,5
i like the fact it has a screen very nice onl down fall i could see would be the fingerprint scanner the camera in dark environments and the  ratio screen it just zooms in on the picture and makes it a little hard to see the whole picture,4
sorry this video is unsupported on this browser  i do not have a month to have it and it has already touched me give it three deletions because it gets out of control i do not get it often but this should not happen in a new phone,2
bought this thinking its dual sim so i can get rid of two phones it isnt even though it says factory unlocked which i understood to mean it supports dual sim do not buy this version if you need dual sim i wasted my money,1
purchased two of these phones for much cheaper than listed at brick and mortar stores first time i purchase cell phones on line transferred files myself pleasantly surprised with how easy i was able to set up this cell phone with my existing service,5
i bought this one for my wife and was unsatisfied because it looks that it wasnt the brend new one it seemed that someone already used it cuz we had a turkish google account on it we always have issues with this phone and we couldnt returning to their manufacturer,1
even though i rather microsofts windows phone that microsoft is not making anymore at least for now this phone is impeccable with great features in fact there are so many great features that i have yet to learn,5
bought this on lightning deal with earbudswhich were never delivered  came into original case but without seal felt like it was opened by someone earlier camera is average too many camera options ruined the ease of taking photos,1
took a few days to get used to the controls but it is a very nice and asy to use phone great pictures and very versitile saved  buying it one prime days over buyi g it from either the carrier or best buys thank you amazon,5
the look and feel of the phone are amazing sleek model but for the cons battery life is not as expected if we use the camera and apps so far the options that came with this model are good the fingerprint reader is not as expected since it is inbuilt,4
i love the quality of pictures  videos the s takes the finger print reader doesnt work everytime which gets annoying but its super easy to transfer your data from an old galaxy to the current  buying one for the hubby when black friday sales comes around,5
have just gotten this phone today and my main concern was if it was us or international version they dont specifically say but for sure this is the snapdragon us version  so im happy with it amazing pictures,5
great screen great performance and great camera fingerprint scanner is not perfect but it works fine once you get used to it the hole punch in the screen is perfect not intrusive at all and looks really cool,5
great phone have had it for a while now and i have no complaints havent had any problem with the finger print scanner it unlocks every time i dont use face recognition so i dont know how good it is also battery life hasnxt been a issue for me at all,5
i loved the crispiness of the display and keyboard smooth operating phone with little lag mainly use it to watch movies and tv the dual sim is amazing due to my job and the camera is clear i dont know if its the camera or display but it is amazing,5
muy buen teléfono cámaras batería y rendimiento espectacular el reconocimiento facial es realmente muy bueno el lector de huellas no me resulta muy práctico pero al ser el reconocimiento facial tan bueno no es casi necesario excelente dispositivo,4
just few days since ordered and its worth the price the only sad thing is that the box wasnt in brand new condition found white spots on the box offset and also there wasnt any plastic wrapped around the box rest assured its awesome,4
the gs is a great all around phone its fast its well designed i like the hole punch compared to the alternatives too bad the camera is downright mediocre compared to the competition in a world of pixel huawei p and iphone samsung has to do better,4
worst phone ive ever owned fingerprint reader is difficult to use freezes up too much  you have to restart apps work better on iphones than this phone the only good thing is the long battery life but not worth  im switching back to mt iphone,1
im glad i bought this expensive a thing i regretted it at first but i mean its a phone its ok to spend this kind of money on a device that rolls with you  its specs are beefy and i havnt had any real issues,5
best phone by far fingerprint reader was troublesome but just set the screen sensitivity higher then it works perfectly camera is excellent wow battery life compared to my old s is phenomenal no issues just a fast good looking phone with alot of features,5
awesome phone just be sure that you know what you are buying this is the international version of the phone which is a tiny bit slower than the us version which has a better processor in it  both phones are incredibly good though,5
i ordered and was billed for a new samsung galaxy s  i received a new samsung galaxy s  nope not closed enough returned it for a refund i believe this time ill just order it directly from samsung,1
wow i love the s my previous sansung s did not last my  hours at work the s uses less than  for the samt time and usage the e tra memory is also great and it works well with android auto which the s did not,5
im not sure why im having the feeling that i received an open box product it was only a sticker on the box and phone without any wrap inside am i missing something love the phone so far but seem i got jibbed,3
we bought this phone for our  yrold works great its all what a  yrold would need to stay in touch with family looks awesome more kids at school started to get the same line of phone with really cool colors,5
around three month the phone completely stop working seen i got phone for my son from day one having little problem here or there i went bought new son card for phone  also found some time wont able receiving call until next same with texts massage,1
has an awesome camera cool and unique way to use it with a sliding function clear and bright amoled display and comes with a case and wireless charger but has allot of pre installed apps that cannot be deleted,5
i really like the g i havent had any problems with it so far  min call to verizon to activate it the only disappointing thing i have found is i cant change the phone name on voice command like i could with the droid turbo i hate calling my phone ok google,5
open camera by twisting action of the wrist turn on the light fast by using a chopping motion while in your hand the phone will switch to driving mode and announce who is calling for hands free operation use voice control videos are clear and the sound is very good,5
moto used to be a premium android brand nowadays its left in the dust by samsung google and even huawei no wireless charging it feels cheap performance leaves a lot to be desired even right out of the box i returned it within the week,3
i love this new phone tmobile had no issues adding it to the service and it was easy to setup battery life is terrific response time in opening appswindows is really fast and the camera takes great pictures would highly recommend,5
found this bad boy on a third party product review site for value picks and i have to say i am very impressed with this phone for the price i used to stick to the samsung j series but motorola just got a new long term customer,5
excellent in every way but  things screen brightness and battery life had to keep phone near  brightness all the time phone has to be charged  times a day went with moto g power instead way better,3
this phone is really good i can not find any fault with it  the professional reviewers say the camera is weak and maybe it is if so download the pixel camera app and you have a b camera the battery life is excellent and the response time is outstanding buy it,5
i dislike the fact this phone should be call teflon as it slides off everything you will need a case cannot complain about anything except android v which automatically turns on wifi to drain your battery because that is what the clowns at google want it to do,5
get a case ive read it in other reviews and experienced the same bit of a bump and the back is shattered dont make gorilla glass like they used to or what so just get a case and youre golden because its a great phone camera in particular is very quality,4
as a long time android user i have to say this is a solid phone setup was easy and works similar to my samsung very user friendly and the price is half of similar phones with the same features and quality,5
i can run this phone all day long with all radios turned on makingtaking calls playing games etc and still have  left at the end of the day the fingerprint reader really really does work fairly flawlessly a great phone for an excellent price,5
this phone does everything i need for  i just cant see spending  to a  for a phone if you need all the bells and whistles then i guess spend the money but if you want a good smartphone this really serves the purpose,5
i really like this phone touch screen is so smooth and image quality is so good its fast and the battery life is very good pictures and video arent super high quality but better than the moto g which was my most recent phone before this one,5
dont buy this phone the description says its unlocked but it is not the att staff people couldnt get it to work and they know their stuff this is why i hate amazon products are not as advertised,1
fingerprint sensor quit working almost three months after purchase the option does not even appear in the settings either would like to be contacted by seller for an immediate replacement fix please thank you,1
love the bright colors on the screen screen size and longlasting battery unfortunately cant seem to get this phone to text over wifi as our previous samsung edge  does handilyvery disappointing,3
updatingphone jams extremely dissatisfied not reliable at times when i touch icons nothing happens ive previously had iphones and huawei which were both problem free ive been using the phone for at least six months very disappointed,2
if this is considered a budget phone than phones have come along way because this is as good as it gets for the price blazing fast processor and memory wonderful features super fast charging good battery life slim and light with perfect screen size  love it,5
so far i love it i have upgraded from a moto g so im used to how these work i do wish motorola had their own stock music app though i cant stand using google play music or amazon music for my tons of some that i already have stored on my micro sd card,5
i upgraded from a g plus love this version this is my second g series phone they are solid products and a good value for the money the notch is very small and the phone has a headphone jack connects well with ford sync,5
got this for my wife to get her away from overpriced apple phones it was a rough few days but she loves it now the display is beautiful no lagging when she plays games and the fact that i can buy three of these for the cost of one iphone make me very happy,5
phone is simple works well no frills but very capable the headphone amp is surprisingly powerful im listening on mxs and it sounds really good i did disable the dolby app to be sure i wasnt hearing some weird eq curve,5
hard to beat the price on this great budget phone doesnt feel cheap at all and very responsive i dont miss my old iphone s even a little motorola did a great job of only installing two apps both of which offer useful features works just great on att,5
love this phone takes great pictures and has lots of features its taken me a while to get used to it going from a apple i phone to moto but its better than my iphone and was  the cost dont miss my iphone at all love the spam call feature,5
i helped out my ex wife and got her this phone as she needed something reliable this phone has been solid and as fast as her old samsung galaxy  she raves about it she likes it so much im getting my mom one for her birthday,5
i activated this phone on my verizon account and there was no option to enable wifi calling very disappointed as the description says this phone works with verizon if it doesnt work fully then that should be indicated,1
this phone is awesome fast updated android operating system good storage one of the best phones ive ever had granted its not a  dollar samsung  plus or whatever the latest is but i highly recommend it,5
it has great battery life speed video quality everything related to talking is really poor people cant hear you and the reception is terrible the phone part of smart phone should have been the focus,1
good price but still must figure how to use it tried some tutoring on youtube helped a bit no brochure or instructions enclosed with the phone i wish it should still had not transferred my old samsung phone to this one yet will do it next month,4
i honestly cant see why people spend  plus on some phones this is a fantastic phone very fast solid and wellbuilt you cant beat value you get out of this phone why be foolish and spend more than   get you a great phone,5
this was a clean brand new moto g from motorola through amazon the phone is great has all its memory free to use not loaded with all the service providers junk you never use we also got the poetic cover for it and jumpy screen savers for extra protection,5
en cuanto a la calidad de lector de huellas pueden mejorar la calidad de la pantalla es aceptable pero de igual manera deja mucho que desear la duración de la batería es otro punto débil ya que no nos da y  horas de uso de la batería se queda en  horas,4
its a great phone great camera too no nfc so no google pay or quick pairing with nfc devices that was the downfall i returned it otherwise its quick and snappy great camera and video light and easy to hold,3
this phone does not work well with my phone service carrier returned for inability to get updates in english in addition to other issues i contacted both motorola and amazon and both were unable to help extremely disappointed,1
a premium phone for the fraction of the price it has everything including face recognition fingerprint reader stereo speakers that r only found on expensive phones portrait style for photos i really recommended,5
everything on this phone works great except that it has poor reception i get a lot of missed calls and a lot of dropped calls the signal meter only gets a couple of bars and apparently im not the only one having this issue,2
from programming their cpus to now using their smartphones i have always found motorola products to be logically intuitive of course thats just me but apple products make absolutely no sense to me i know moto is owned now by lenovo but the mindset carries on,5
reliable good phone for the money pure android experience camera above average though not iphone or samsung great battery life is on par with the concenjs of good life phones sounds decent could use the extra speaker but not bad i paid  cant complain,4
this cell takes great photos and videos the sound on this phone is very loud and clear so many great features is worth every penny i got this smartphone with my cellular service claro in pr and im very pleased with the quality of the product,5
i ignored the reviews to use caution with us sales and regret it now the seller is misleading while the phone does work with metro it cant get g lte leaving you with bad service most of the time also the sim card try on mines was stuck,1
i bought this phone with great eagerness and wasted several hours setting it up only to find that it gets almost zero cellular signal in my area my old moto g and g had much stronger signal therefore i rate this product a big fail,1
big screen good battery life good performance excellent connectivity android not cluttered with too much useless software the only con is the lack of nfc this is not a big deal to me right now but it could be as digital payment systems become for common,4
this was by far the best android phone that i have ever had unfortunately it was not compatible with my service provider and i regretfully had to return it my refund was quickly processed and i was very regretful of the mistake because it was so good,5
i believe i was sent a latin american version as all documentation and the package were in either portuguese or spanish even notification of update from motorola came through in spanishportuguese phone seems fine otherwise,2
i have been acquiring the motorola brand for almost  years i have not had any problem with them its pure native android software makes me use the phone in its maximum capacity good memory use audio quality video performance,5
i really like motorola midrange phones it does everything i ask of it without costing me an arm and a leg i have stopped buying phones from cell service providers because of all the junk apps they install on the phones battery life is phenomenal,5
got it friday its sunday and still have  battery menus and apps run smoothly with no lag that i have seen my need for speed no limits game runs smoothly and good amount of eye candy upgrade over note  and my nexus  as well,5
received and set it up pretty quickly just in case you are looking for a clarification i use tmobile and i just put in the phone my sim card it took less that seconds to find the network lte speed is excellent and battery life is so far outstanding,5
if you live in the us dont waste your time in ordering it its not compatible with any carrier i ignored the one stars because of the positives received today tmobile sprint verizon nope sent back tonight dont waste your time,1
its an amazing phone i have absolutely no complaints about it whatsoever its fast and responsive its very neat and i love that its not riddled with third party apps the battery amazing enough said,5
ordered this for my senior aged dad works on tmobile network he lives in a big city upgrade from a moto g nice big phone with monster battery hes enjoying it so far only negative is no dual band wifi connectivity otherwise dependable unit,4
bought this phone for my daughter and shes crazy about it has a lot of features normally found on much more expensive phones great battery life and very fast response i totally recommend for people looking for great tech without paying stupid prices,5
seems like a screaming deallove it so far but be aware this does not use the standard micro usb the charger w it wont work on any american targeted phones  all your old phone charges wont work on this one vendor should note this  include a car charger,4
the best value for money and most power effecient one of the best mobile i ever had very happy with its performance and the battery lifei am not an avid mobile game player but use it for frequent browsing and social media,5
there is no  gigahertz wifi support i was unable to connect to lte on band  reception on both lte bands  and  as well as wifi  gigahertz were very poor and the connections were extremely slow i returned the phone immediately,1
this phone meets my needs and last for quite a long time i barely keep track of how many hours exactly between charges low usage for myself at times it can be a day or so before battery needs a good charge comfortable ui and a nice intuitive motorola built ins,5
im sort of techsavvy but not an expert by any means didnt realize that this phone does not even see mhz wifi networks not cool i like several things about it but trying to decide if i can live with the lack of support for faster wifi networks,3
i got this phone for my  year old and  weeks ago and so far is good i love the fact the got dual sd card plus already gb internal memory and long battery life i am even thinking i may get one for myself,4
got this phone to replace another motorola upgrade was very easy and so far i love its screen resolution  camera battery life is ok it has a different usb connector will force me go buy new chords ,5
not sure if this is usspecific but assuming it is from the other reviews this phone has two frustrating features ignores calls when i know im being called with full bars forever trying to download mms aka group messages,1
ive had iphones samsungs lgs this is the best phone ive ever owned no joke fast as hell great camera with apps battery lasts forever indestructible ive destroyed quite a few never owned a moto wont own anything else,5
phone has worked great and has done everything my old samsung could  and keep doing it for  days my old samsung sometimes had trouble lasting the whole day i havent used the camera much  but seems to take pictures that meet my very undemanding standard,5
this phone is absolutely amazing im a moto guys have had multiple moto g phones and this one takes the cake in all areas love the new finger print reader on the back and was able to go  hours after first charge before i had to charge again and charge speed in unreal,5
phone doesnt work it was a waste of money it only worked for a few days then started to reboot every minute i reset the phone to factory settings thinking it would fix issue but it didnt called moto said they cant do anything because phone is not from the us,1
although the ad is clearly marked no warranty now it wasnt when i purchased it speaker stopped working after three weeks no response to email i sent to seller spend the extra  and get a usa model that has a warranty i did and its a great phone,1
fantastic phone so far works fine on straight talk with a gsm sim camera isnt the greatest i have had lte the whole time ive been using it so far wisconsin but others have reported limited lte connectivity in other rural areas,5
it worked right away as soon as i inserted the sim cardnano from my old phone some applications did not switch from the old phone the version seems to be outdated while on the whole i am happy with the purchase,5
i didnt expect the phone to work so good the camera quality isnt the best but everything else is great i would definitely recommend this to others who would prefer better battery life than camera quality,5
this xt model number with gb is the latin american model from mexico the actual band coverage is as follows           buyers beware this is not the usa model or european model and might not work in your region with your carrier,1
people write negative reviews to get over on paying or trying to get money back while still keeping their inferior unusable product get the new moovie lies deceit and corruption on planet of the apes,5
great cellphone for heavy surfing and talkingtake good picture too i lost my pixel  xl this is a great replacement phone for have the price this phone is a buy my wife replace her iphone  with a g power bigger battery more to like,5
this was the best phone i ever has but i had to return it because i could not get a cell signal when at home with mint mobile tmobile network couldnt get wifi calling to work either this is the international version i will try the us version,3
almost flagship performance for  unlocked is amazing the manual was in spanish but we were able to choose english for the phone and didnt really need the manual anyway i can read some spanish but didnt need to it is normal near stock android,5
it checks all of the boxes plus some if you want a powerful longlasting phone at a reasonable price then this is the one for you it is highly recommended it was delivered promptly and in good condition,5
this would have been a great phone over the us version if it worked properly in the us  ghz wifi no go on cricket i couldnt get lte and make calls if i changed settings to the exact same as the us version i could make calls but then lose lte,2
motorola website says this is compatible with tmobile that is true only in certain parts of the usa it is not true in ny motorola knows it and is not doing anything about it dont be fooled dont get this phone in ny,1
very good phone face recognition works perfectly fingerprint scanner works good until you put glass screen protector very slick design with good curves  gb of ram makes phone run smoothly i recommend this phone,5
excellent phone beautiful  and smooth operator very fast boot time clean streamlined vivid display and enormous storage with compromising the speed and operation i would buy this product  times over again,5
works great just as advertised the camera quality is impreesive and love the facial recognition it has better screen quality than other phones ive used on the other hand the fingerprint scanner doesnt pick up sometimes when screen protector is on,4
excellent phone at a great price if youre looking for a solid phone thats pretty quick and wont break the bank this is the phone for you performance is really good and has a solid camera with good battery life,5
amazing phone with way more features than one would expect also very high water resistance rating excellent cameras and plenty of memory with a memory card slot using mine with googlefi and am super happy that i took the chance,5
gotta love pure android better than moto g i switched to moto from flagship samsungs no bloatware however i bought this phone for  few months ago and now its  that is not a good price for this its good for  not  ,5
a great value purchase if you are looking for a midrange device on a budget the only downfall to this device that i can honestly gripe about is the camera and no google camera apks sideloaded programs do not make the camera stellar,4
even though it said attunlocked one the phone i got was unlocked from tmobile but after i inserted my sim it updated for att so far i like it its a brand new phone smooth the camera is great glad i got this,5
i love this phone i have nothing negative to say about the way this phone works it everything i expected and more my cell phone provider is with metro and had no problems setting it up in less than  minutes i would recommend,5
i bought this phone for three reasons  price se market recognition and dual i bought a us snapdragon for my wife what a difference this exynos unit is a shame wifi battery and overall performance makes this phone almost useless a no go,1
excelente design great performance great display and camera im not much into edge to edge screens and this flat screen with discrete vesels is very good to look at and use size is great for high range specs,5
it doesnt have the snapdragon processor and has lower battery life my lg g lived for a lot longer and id still be using it if it werent for extraordinary circumstances other than that its fine too shiny to handle with human hands requires a case,4
the fingerprint reader is the best other galaxy s have ultrasonic readers that are finicky at best and slow and unresponsive at times the main purpose of buying this was for the finger print reader and samsung pay that i love,5
had to do  sw upgrade but so far but the real test is when we bring it back to philippines if its not regional block it came with screen protector layer and a back cover which is nice i read that the screen protector isnt as good but so far it is sticking nicely,5
accidentally bought it because it was cheaper and my favorite color but my carrier didnt cover it apparently international does not mean usa so if youre in the us please dont make the same mistake i did ,3
ive had this phone for a few months now and i like it im planning on ordering one of the larger ss ive always liked the smaller galaxy s phones but after seeing and playing with s im gonna get one,4
i bought this as a gift it was loved the speakers are loud the response is great it is a bit small as far as size but many reviewed that the s screen tends to break a lot i would recommend this phone love it,5
este teléfono es tan costoso y no es muy bueno cuando esta frío no me agarra carga porque dise que tiene humedad y cuando esta caliente tampoco dise que detecto una temperatura muy alta no es bueno no lo compren esta mda,1
it is too heavy for me to operate with one hand its weight makes it difficult for my onehanded finger to support it when operating the fingerprint authentication button or the home button the other hand is needed,4
i had a great deal compared to what they were charging me at t mobile bought it cash along a amazon gift card the phone has been return by a customer but it was brand new i love it smooth shipping through prime membership,5
great phone just had an issue with my internet when i changed my plan on att i lost all internet connection since i never sold my old phone they were able to mimic my old phone that was purchased through att and my internet was restored,5
ive owned samsung phones for the past  years from the s to s to s s plus s and now this s plus everything seems genuine but the battery seems to drain a bit quicker than my previous s maybe because its a dual sim,5
i love my new phone i upgraded from a s to the  omg what a difference i utilized youtube to help me learn how to use all of the new awesome features amazon has a smart watch that pairs with the phonelove it,5
i upgraded to s after a long time of using an old a im very happy after around  months of use i wont go in all the details as i recommend you to check youtube videos about it overall i would say it has the best value for money among top segment phones,5
brand new never opened for a great price im personally not a fan of the biometric security features its a little too personal  invasive for my liking other than that awesome phone very helpful seller as well,5
do not purchase this phone from this seller this phone claims to be unlocked but does not work on either verizon sprint or metro pcs those are the three carriers i tried and i am done and will not continue to jew trying,5
entrega eficiente y en buenas condiciones los conectores del cargador son europeos pero te incluyen el adaptador en cuanto al rendimiento de la bateria del celular dura mucho menos que la de un mate  pro pero alcanza para el dia,4
this product has been working great for me so far i am in the us and use att i put my sim card in and its been working great i did have to do a deep dive and change every single time zone and language to the us which did take some finagling but overall a good buy,4
setup was very simple ive been using the phone for about two weeks and it is a vast improvement from my iphone  i dont like bixbyit interferes with photographing and i find that very frustrating but all and alli like the samsung s,4
ive had this for a few months now and it still works like a gem no problems yet i have a minimally tough case and a screen protector no problems super easy to set up out of the case no issues with cell carrier i have tmobile and live in the states,5
i havent tried some of the samsung features that apparently dont work on the international version of the phone but this is a legit s at a huge discount very happy upgrading from the s i was getting decreased performance and extremely short battery life,5
there was no indication this cell phone would not work on verizon carrier when opened the package there was a letter telling that it will not work with verizon i would never have spent over  just to have to return the product when it arrived waste of time,1
at first i was a bit hesitant to buy this phone because of its bad reviews but i took the risk anyways and i am very happy that i did it came sealed with free memory card and the phone is just amazingly beautiful with its price i am definitely happy with my buy,5
i dont usually spend so much on one thing online  but i took a chance and dont regret  great phone brand new out of the box and beautiful great upgrade from my s  already ordered another one for my wife  great deal ,5
very responsive media and gaming is very nice battery took a few days for the phone to adjust to usage but lasts pretty much all day now slight issues with samsung pay set up and reception was not as good as my old phone but still works,4
i love this phone but it loses a star because mine is a massive pain in the ass to charge for some reason when i plug it in of the cable is not in just right it acts like your unplugging it and plugging it back in alot and its really annoying,4
fantastic device connected to work in minutes as im always on the go this is a change out from my years on a windows mobile device battery life can do with some improvements have to charge everydaybut overall love it,5
got this phone last june i ask if i can return it seem like refurbished but didnt have a chance to send it backi remember it says open line now im home i cannot used it need to unlocked disappointed to much,3
ive had it for a little over a month and so far its working just fine im using it for dual sims but you cant add memory if youre using two sims also some limitations but very minor when using dual sims other than that performance has been as expected,5
i like this phone model i bought this phone as a gift to my wife unfortunately the phone turned out to be defective there is a pink tint on the screen amazon does not want to properly help customers who are not in the usa this is very sad,3
there are so many reviews out there so i wont go into too much detail but i love the phone and have always been a pure android guy so i wont go with any brand other than google aka pixel  nexus just be sure to comp shop for the best price,5
im very happy with this phone it was a huge improvement from my previous phone the camera is fantastic even in low light and the playground app is so fun i wish the battery life was better  i was expecting more but charging is super quick so no big deal,5
got it on sale just before pixel came awesome photos great android phone replaced my galaxy s battery life seems fine but im not on my phone  great battery saver modes if you need easy transitioning to other screensapps im happy with it,5
i had been looking into switching from blackberry to a pixel phone for a while now i absolutely made the right choice everything about this phone is impressive it is perfect for people who are constantly on their phones and multitasking,5
waited a week for this phone after troubleshooting over an hour i took this phone to a sprint store they said it is not unlocked and cant be used on the sprint network very disappointing experience caused by completely inaccurate seller description,1
i ordered a new pixel  as a gift but instead got a phone that did not start i am returning the phone but went through the embarrassment of gifting a broken device and having to undergo the hassle of returning the phone please dont buy its not worth it,1
bought one a few weeks ago the esim does activate on google fi others having trouble activating the esim might have received one from a different seller mine was shipped from  sold by amazoncom its an unlocked us model,4
this is the most fragile phone screen i have had since smart phones first came out it is worse if you get the google case but if you are a phone dropper like i am do not get this phone its a great phone other than the screen,2
the ring tones only play through one of the two speakers and is consequently very low can only be heard in very quiet environments google refuses to fix the software in spite of numerous complaints you will miss many calls,3
the display of the phone is great importantly the camera is top of the line i like the phone especially at this price point the only issue is that the battery life is not good the phone doesnt last even a day on a full charge,4
i bought this phone for my wife and was starting to get very concerned because of the bad reviews we received an unlocked pone that as loaded with non carrier specific samsung software very happy with out purchase so far,5
the phone came in perfectly i put in my tmobile card and it worked i am going to be going to south korea and if i have any issues i will edit my review if the dual sim card doesnt work but a never pay full price,5

the smartphone seems to be ok but no signature required at the delivery quite expensive parcel was just dropped in front of the door the original box was already open and dirty like a second hand phone there was no invoice and promissed year us warranty list,1
i had to return the phone back to amazon because the imei it is not recognized by att as a lte smartphone and does not work properly i suspect att and sony mobile did not coordinate in between the range of the imei numbers that work with att,1
i upgraded from the xz premium and the xperia  just improves on everything it had i love the display for videos and especially just browsing in general is a lot better since i always have a lot of information on my screen,5
overall this phone is perfect for what i need and want beautiful video quality great pictures and k video is fantastic best phone ive ever had coming off from my note  i prefer this over the note ,5
for this price you get a good display and a magnificent backfacing camera but fingerprint sensor not is rubbish the battery life is mediocre the phone collects fingerprints on touch screens and back conclusion does not worth the price,3

using it right now to write this review just put my sim card in it and set it up and it was good to go same phone number and there was nothing wrong with the phone or sketchy about it my service provider is att if that helps anyone,5
its a great phone overall but unfortunately if you get the phone with more storage it will not work in the united states even if you have a gsm carrier found this out the hard way after visiting my carrier and contacting samsung help center,3
i did like the phone but there is no pin provided in the box to open the sim and card slot i am not able to open the sim card slot i am not satisfied with the box contents it is not organized and not helpful,1
from what i was able to find out that this model supports lte bands for tmobile and att i bought one it will arrive on wednesday will report back just got phone and it does have lte support for tmobile and att,5
i highly recommend this phone very fast read my sim card right away once installed notice the lte on the pic has a solid build and feel to it and very hefty which is a major plus for me definitely five stars,5

i loved the product excellent camera but unfortunately it came with a little damage on the side the box was intact though if i could return and ask for a new one i would but im in the us only for a week,5
not pleased with the phone i have had multiple days that i am not able to make nor receive actual phone calls no one seems to care i know it is the phone because i put my sim card into another phone and it works just fine,1
definitely a step up over budget phones i am used to having took one star off for all the built in mi apps and advertisements that come with it can replace most of them with google apps if you want to avoid their cloud,4
awsome phone for a great price battery will last for days for an average user finger print reader was initialy good but sometimes not accurate photos are realy good in quality again colors are little too bright everything else was perfect,5
great overall specs but the phone do miss a noticeable some of on time calls and texts you do get notifications of these but theyre delayed checked specs online and it stated a  compatibility with our tower bands then everything made sense,3

el teléfono se ve muy bien realmente me encant lo único malo por lo que no le doy las  estrellas es la cámara que sobresale y el forro que trae no la protege con los días cualquier golpecito le va a rayar el lente es lamentable,4
overall its the best phone ive ever had the only part i dont care for is the sensor that is located where you put the phone to your ear if you move the phone slightly during a phone call it will call someone else,5
ive went through this phone thoroughly and it has a bunch of awesome features and runs very smooth the only thing that disappointed me was that it didnt have wps or push button pin transfer for easy access to my wireless modem,5

there is only  main issue i have with this phone i have metro pcs and though it says it has wifi calling it wont activate if this issue could be fixed this would definitely be an excellent phone for the price,4
wheres the different option for color storage also the pro version also wasnt the phone supposed to be  not  theres no where i can see on the official site cost about double in other sites also need more capatable phone carrier brands,3
the only problem it came with a british a adapter but i used my own from my old phone bonus it came with a transparent case the battery can last for days i didnt like the installed xiaomi apps so i disabled them and used google apps,5

tried to cancel was too late i am glad it was too late great phone and great price the sell included charger plug converter for us that worked great this is international model and it does all i want in the us,5
the phone is pretty works fine the only thing is that came with a some type of european plug that is big together with an adaptor for usa see photos well i guess is because this phone is global version oh well   funciona muy bien en lima  peru ,4
the item does not match the description instead of mfg global version ive received mfe standard version which works only in edgeinternet mode no g no lte i was disappointed and returned it back,1
i had some doubts at the beginning but after trying this and the mi  lite i can say that xiaomi is the real deal nice camera fast processor big storage and reliable fingerprint reader no complains so far except for the ads,5
this phone only works with tmobile and attcricket gsm towers but if got those providers then what you doing spending more than  on a phone this has the same specs of them iphones for a fourth of the price,5

so far so good works fast the battery last long and im satisfied however it comes with european charger and a us adpator that supports standard charge despite the phone supports fast w charge but overall satisfied,5
well overall the phone is good for the price that i paid except the battery is worse than my  year old honor  that i was replacing the reason i bought it cuz the reviews said phone battery will last a long time not,3
just got this phone and i am so pleased the blue gradient glass is so beautiful and everything works so well plays games smoothly and has plenty of storage my only complaints are miui not having an app drawer and the selfie camera having very underwhelming quality,5

good quality good price doesnt have a few features im used to but i am not complaining so far it blows my s out of the water with performance and how smooth it operates definitely worth it if you need a good phone on a budget,5

this phone is a good gaming phone i can play my first person shooter games and the controls are very smooth long lasting battery life even while im playing games good quality pictures even in low level light for a midrange phone this phone is high quality,5
good phone works good with at network phone is good for the price camera is kinda good doesnt compare to the higher end devices but if what you want is a good phone for a decent price i highly recommend it,5
it is a great phone for the price but the one i received was made for india area used  causing the calling quality problem even though it was unlocked  the samsung care center in us cannot do anything for it due to the system is different  i refunded it,5
this phone was described as new was not sealed and when opened the box was some dust all around battery was drained and after powering on the phone was ready to use instead of factory reset welcome stage language etc returning this wasted time,1

the phone works great but the pen attached arrived dead on arrival it is completely non functional ive already ordered a new one but i shouldnt have had to other than that the phone is what i expect of samsung it is clean fast and crystal clear picture,4
so i read a lot of reviews about this product coming damagedlocked behind original carrieretc but im glad to say that the phone i received was in mint condition phone works great and i have yet to run into any issues,5
product came with screen protector attached weird with finger prints all over it unresponsive on right side and not tmobile carrier branded seller quick to approve refund label though but the product was not what i expected to get,1
the first device that arrived was defective however the vendor promptly sent another one in time for christmas the device came early and its appearance is flawless i will update my review as days goes by after continuous usage so far so good,5
my phone arrived a week ago and the battery doesnt even last a day even when the battery saver is turned on face recognition recognizes my sisters face we are not that alike and sometimes doesnt recognizes mine,2

llego a tiempo su batería dura todo el día lee rápido mi huella dactilar y el reconocimiento facial es rápido el celular es veloz y tiene buena cámara trasera la cámara frontal es mala para video llamadas nocturna pero en todo lo demás un telefonazo,5
i contacted the seller they told its not part of the standard package  i asked them why do you show it then  to fool the customers  they did not reply  the phone works good but only concern was the stylus pen ,2
so i wanted the latest iphone but came across this gem and boy am i relieved i went with redmi note  this phone exceeded my expectations from design to software  it is value for your money and not to discredit iphone but the redmi note  is way better,5
great phone working for me in florida usa incredible camera particularly the portrait mode solid built call quality is awesome no drops superfast phone where everything is great except wifi calling doesnt work even after disabling checks,4
like g memory solid hardware except wifi dislike the software is full of bloatware google redmi note  bloatware you will find a lot of links on this for some reason the wifi signal is relatively weak,3
wanted to be able to have my phone and a quick sketch camera in one box in my pocket that works camera can be good but i have not mastered it yet phone is surprisingly good better than apple very good value for a low price,5
i had just opened the phone  but it is only gb and not gb i contacted amazon and they are saying that they had sent me the correct phone picture attached with what i gotgb go buy the gbbecause there is a change that you wouldnt get gb,1
phone is greatit is actually faster than my aging st gen pixel the biggest issue with this phone is the lack of ghz wifi support it just wont see those networks and will be stuck with the slowercongested ghz network,4
i use phone for calls and listening to music it is great for this sound quality and loudness are both good i dont use the camera the camera or game so i cant speak to those areas battery lasts forever for me,5
manual was in spanish fortunately i have the older moto phone and it was very easy to get everything transferred to the new phone battery life is just fantastic g power is a great product at a great price,4
they originally did not send me  gb sd card even though it was supposed to be part of the deal then i ordered a replacement phone which they sent it quickly overall i am happy so far battery life is good,3
battery lasts up to four days better than my wifes samsung s picture quality not as good but this phone is a great value it does everything i need it to when i can purchase phones like this at the price point i will never buy an expensive iphone or samsung,5
the device vibration intensity is very low you cant feel it is vibrating when you receive calls loud speaker is very low its is better to buy other mid range devices from samsung etc its not definitely worth the money,1
battery life is amazing after two full days of setup and downloads i still have  battery havent installed sim card yet so i expect that to increase battery drain down side is no g wifi but i can live with that for my purposes,4
what i most like is the fingerprint reader it simplifies unlocking the phone camera is good for common uses battery last about  days which doubles the time of my previous moto e phone so far so good all still working perfect it works good in mexico,5
sinceramente estoy desconforme con el producto ya que en las especificaciones de amazon dice gb de almacenamiento y gb de ram pero tiene  de ram y  de almacenamiento y la vdd pues estoy muy inconforme pero necesito el teléfono así que ni mod,1
dont know this was the international version its bounces from lte to edge randomly no matter what tmobile apn i use anytime i make a phone call its drops to g which i never noticed on any other unlocked device i had in the past,2
this phone is not compatible with glte networks its only limited to  g the voice quality for calls is lower it costs to be more attentive in order to hear the whole voicethis phone is overpriced compared to other phones market value of the same features,2
i would give this negative stars if i could do not buy this phone this phone is listed as compatible with tmobile it is not this model is wrong region and does not connect to any tmobile bands in the us i returned right after receiving,1
we liked the pictures but thats all didnt work well with our carrier lots of dropped calls and missed calls landed up buying another phone missed our return window and it had a small crack in a corner we didnt notice until it was too late,1
i am soooo excited to have this phone it is amazing for the price unbelieveable i recommend this phone to anyone scrren big and bright camera good and it is overall a fun device to have face detector very fast and accurate get u this phone,5
i purchased this phone for a relative thinking it was a good buy for the phone money wrong this phone has been nothing but trouble constant resets freezing and cuts off i recommend no one buy this phone not in the us its buggy and unreliable,5
this phone is an international phone it was not supposed to be i am unable to register it for a warranty tried calling they never answer the phone left messages no return call yet i will never buy from them again,1
this is a great phone but the seller gothams cells does not specify that it is not a phone that will work with verizon or sprint this was a waste of my time the seller should have in bold red letters do not buy this phone if your carrier is verizon or sprint,1
i am very pleased with this phone and even tho is not water proof i never get my cellphone wet anyways so its ok if its not buy it you gonna like it just dont expect the fingerprint sensor on screen to be top of the line it works some times,5
the phone slowed down after one week i also had an issue where the screen timeout would change to  secconds automatically customer support could not help me in resolving my issue and their employees were unprofessional they are based in the philippines,1
works great so far pretty fasthave  apps running with no issues battery great camera is ok biggest concern for me was will it support g lte on tmobileit does streaming data via hotspot without issues great deal,5
i only can say it was a really good experience buy from this seller the product is exactly to the description they have i only have  days with the phone and it is work perfectly for now and it is work good with metropcs,4
bought this for my  yr old son whos starting high school this year didnt want to spend an arm  leg after watching many reviews on the product decided to pull the trigger my son loves it so i guess its a win win and for  bucks cant complain,5
samsung software loaded on this phone is horrible bixby does not appear to be uninstallable and is a lost cause i no longer trust samsung with my privacy samsung should stick to hardware and leave the software to people that know what there doing,4
it costs onefourth as much as the galaxy s and i havent found anything lacking there must be s features i dont know about and therefore probably wouldnt use but i am very happy with the a one of the best buys on the mobile phone market,5
do not order this is you are with verizon i was fooled as my mother got this phone recently from the verizon store however it appears that the one being sold here is not compatible with the verizon cdma network this is not made clear anywhere in the description,1
this samsung galaxy a is without a doubt far and above the best cell phone i have ever owned including iphones my thanks to amazon for giving me a great price dont hesitate to order one you will love it,5
dont buy from this seller it stopped working after  months the display is black and im not able to interface the phone has no scratches and it never been dropped tried to contact the vendor several times but they never replied,1
phone is visually appealing and feels light yet solid to hold screen resolution is very nice i wasnt quite sure what carrier i could go through so i gambled on straight talk and guessed correctly very happy with my purchase i would reccomend this phone to anyone,5
i bought this phone instead of iphone   of the price same base storage pluse sd card ultra wide camera and standard wide camera on the back make good pictures love android auto working smoothly with this phone the display is amoled loving its picture quality,5
the samsung galaxy a is a phenomenal budget phone for those that dont want to spend hundreds upon hundreds of dollars for the top of the line phone this is a great alternative you wont be disappointed,5
i dislike that the fingerprint does not work when i first setup the phone it worked perfectly after the update i tried using it and it does not want to accept my fingerprint i deleted it and try my new print and does not want to accept,5
the smartphones as fine but the micro sd included in the bundle has brought me some problems it disappears from the phone and i have tested it in other equips giving reading problems it is a shame otherwise it would be perfect,4
that picture was taken from my bathroom window with a screen in front still clear detail colors are vibrant they said tuesday the th of nov my phone got here on the th of nov totally excited it working great at the moment camera is awesome,5
i love the phone but i think i received a defective phone i got a black screen twice in the two weeks ive had it had to do a soft reset also the fingerprint reader doesnt work well the facial recognition is a little better battery life not very good,1
i ordered a blue samsung a but what i got was a black samsung a even though i paid the price for a blue one everything else is okay though there was a nice transparent case and a gb sd card included i liked everything but the color,4
great value for money fingerprint reader and night vision arent as good as others on the market but i knew that was a possibility when i ordered it overall im very happy with the phone and think it was a great price for all the things the phone does,4
no me gusta nada el calendario es difícil de ver porque no tiene cuadricula completa en cada dia y los contactos favoritos del teléfono aparecen como una lista por orden alfabético y no se pueden ordenar por importancia,4
i dont use face recognition and the fingerprint works sometimes but other then that it is a great phone takes good pictures i really love the battery life cause im using my phone all day for so many different things would definetly recommend getting it,4
phone operates very well easy to get started and load profile to fabulous pictures bright screen and comfortable in your hand i love the iridescent back cover works great with mint mobile great price for a great phone,5
love the phone would suggest the info that this model international is not compatible with cdma providers be clearly stated in the product description i got lucky but would have been unhappy to have purchased a phone i could not use,4
bought this phone for my dad in august  has been going on very well takes great pics battery life is amazing no issues if youre looking for an affordable budget phone this is the one no regrets,5
the phone is amazing why spend the amount on a note  when this phone has nearly the same features of it of course it dont have everything as the note  but for a quarter of the price i am truly satisfied,5
el teléfono funciona muy bien y es apto para usarlo con la empresa claro en argentina la única falla que le encuentro hasta ahora es el reconocimiento de la huella dactilar que no funciona tan bien como esperaba,4
seller response that he will not help he suggest to go by my self and try fix it  very bad support by the seller very bad device good seller is the one he help you when you have issue and this one for sure are not good one,1
great phone works with att  i get lte  wish the internal memory was more like the afd fingerprint sensor is the worst if you can live without this is a great deal  had samsung years ago finally they made a good medium range smartphone doesnt break the bank,4
takes beautiful pictures live mode is portrait mode on the iphone it is your best friend when it comes to portraits heres live mode and wide mode im super sad that the lcd broke when i dropped it with a case on it and cant get it fixed,4
havent tried face recognition yet but i love this phone hate tempered glass included separately with a case i bought because of how hard you have to press down on the screen sometimes definitely worth it compatible with straight talk,5

i very like the phone and i very sad to not buy two instead one the gb memory is ok for the price of the phone i bought it for my wife and shes so happy for the phone camera and everything that she need i did not test the face recognition,4
when i opened the package there was a card that said stop not compatible with verizon my carrier it didnt state that in the ad that i could see no i have to return it and the  cases i bought for it not happy,1
i have to restart this phone at least x a day i dont understand why i cant even get through a simple game of solitaire without having to restart it ive had it only about  days i havent dropped it i dont understand what is happening,2
i like the metalic blue color i especially liked the fact that as the seller said it would work with my carrier consumer cellular i have not had a chance to do the fingerprint and face recognition and have not had it long enough to comment on the battery life,5
great price huge screen and great features however i had constant problems with disconnecting from the wifi also voice recognition is extremely sluggish fingerprint scanner works about half the time and facial recognition also works about half the time,2
los iconos de las aplicaciones son muy feos y viene com muchas aplicaciones preinstaladas de juegos que a mi no me agradan por que yo no uso juegos el telefono es para mi una herramienta de trabajo y de comunicacion ahi se los devuelvo,1
i have not used many features that are installed only the ones i need what i have used operates perfectly and with very good speed a better phone than the ones ive owned previously for about the same price,5
pros dual sim cards memory can be expanded with tf card excellent display decent cpu performance good battery life cons wireless reception is a little bit weak with the same sim card my iphone shows  bars of signal but this phone only shows one,4
the product i great budget phone but the fingerprint sensor is ok not the greatest the face recognition is solid overall dont over think this phone much better then you think better display then iphone  and xr,5
fingerprint reader might be a user issue but i just went straight back to password i could only get my fingerprint to unlock the screen about  of the time good price good battery life great pictures,4
el lector de huellas es una pesadilla si es critico para usted que el lector de huellas funcione bien no compre este celular digan lo que digan el lector de huellas es una pesadilla solo funciona  de cada tres veces es sumamente lento y poco fiable,3
phone does not have any warranty not even the manufacturer one from samsung the phone i received was from a latin country market no point of owning this phone without warranty when many people have reported some or other failure within a month returned back,2
great value for the money i dont know why so many people get these super expensive  phones anymore phones like these are all you really need highly recommend so far so good nokia is staying consistent with excellent products,5
excellent phone in costa rica work well carrier kolbi ice  in the box  mi   simple protective cover  power adapter  usb typec cable  typec to audiojack  adaptive cable  sim eject tool  user guide  warranty card,5
honestly i do not understand why in the past i would pay premium prices for flagship phones that do not outperform the mi  what more is there to say i got a galaxy s equivalent for a fraction of the price,5
the g option does not work with my carrier at all also any time i receive a text the entire phone freezes  pauses i bought it because a few reviews say its a good gaming phone but it candle being in a game and getting a call or text,2
love it havent had it long and its a major upgrade over my sony xperia xa ultra faster the camera is excellent i dont have anything bad to say about this phone ill recommend it to anyone looking for a good midrange phone,5
the phone is a very nice phone the camara is sexy and the response time is great  however the battery life is not good recharge this device  to three times daily even tried dim lights and to use more dark backgrounds battery drains quite fast,5
this has the same hardware dont pay thousand dollars to samsung or apple this is it just get it it has flagship  snapdragon  gb ram alot of space aand great camera and its fast like samsung note  i have that too,5
for  you arent getting a better deal on a phone than this camera quality is stellar performance is topnotch and the screen is beautiful battery is a little on the smaller side but is still able to get through a full day i highly recommend this phone,5
snapchat laggs a little bit and picture looks smaller when seen on other phones maybe needs a new update on miui  other then that its a good phone wish it had a app drawer dont really like it looking like a iphone,4
i only docked a star for  reason  the stock launcher didnt have an app drawerhad to load a third party launcher to have an app drawer to help with organization  the finger print scanner didnt work consistently otherwise a very good product,4
best camera over ever used only thing im getting use to is not having a secondary app vault at my disposal but ive learned to play with different launchers that have them and have just gotten use to it and use more folders for storage,5
not all its cracked up to be literally screen cracked and went back in one week the screen is not made how the z was i was very disappointed and decided to return the replacement too this phone is not going to last at all,2
great top of the line product for the price you pay when comparing it to flagship products from apple and samsung night vision is awesome and the  mod is pretty unique addition if youve never tried it before,5
excellent operating system great camera and really user friendly the night vision camera is by far what is best in the market and take pictures better than any other phone the price is really low for a smartphone of this level,5
this was advertised for verizon but non of the features work no wifi calling no g mod and there more do your research and amazon please dont do the false ads please that happens way to much on your site,1
excellent phone with good camera nice full frame screen and really cool moto mod support i can snap on my projector and watch movies or my sons moto mod speaker and hear the bass in music overall its a great versatile phone,5
had a droid zforce which had a gorilla glass face for three years no problemi thought the z was the replacement had the same glass drop the phone in about  ft on loose gravel not moving in the face shattered this is my fourth motorola phone and i think my last,1
this phone is great a little annoyed with the upcharge on it but at the time of purchase it was the only option i had at my disposal for monthly payments for an unlocked device this might be the most perfect phone out there,5
had the phone for over a week been using it for mobile gaming and social media battery life has been great performance has been out of this world best thing that i love so far is the warp charging its just incredible,5
i know is use phones but for the price of  it looks in a bad condition unfortunately you take a risk when you buy phones with out been able to see them and are used and i am not happy with this purchase,2
totalmente descontento con el iphone no estaba desbloqueado y no funciona para ninguna compañia es una vergüenza porque fue un engaño porque el iphone lo llevaba para otro país sino es porque me doy cuenta a tiempo,1

i got this phone in june i cant be happier came in like new condition battery at a  can last over hrs of normal use i upgraded from iphone s which battery lasted merely hrs i would really recommend this phone,5
it works and performs as described the iphone is way faster than my old iphone plus although it is the exact same dimensions as the old phone except for the camera lense on the back otherwise an excellent product thanks,5
el telefono esta like new funcionamiento perfecto quizas la vida util de la bateria no es la del cel nuevo pero diria que esta al  con gran uso de redes sociales me alcanza  horas sin recargar,5
the product arrived on time the phone looked absolutely brand new it came with a charger in a box i have been using it for a week havent found a problem at all the phone is in perfect shape and does not show any problem definitely recommended,5

i expected the refurbished iphone xs max to come with all items it was originally sold with the audio phones were not included this is especially annoying because only audio phones with a special plugin will work on this iphone,3

im really impress wasnt to sure to get an iphone from amazon  wasnt to sure what i was going to receive  but i am really happy with the phone looks beautiful and works great no problem this seller is really good wont mind buying form them again thank you,5
apple iphone xs is a great phone and the seller kept his side of the deal however when i received the phone i was not impressed due to the small screen size i have shipped it back through ups and ordered apple iphone xs max  gb instead,4
arrived today seems no problem but a really little bit of scratches on the edges but its not appear came with just charger and lightning usb after having this for  days i can tell you it was a good deal at least for me,4
phone screen was in pretty rough shape when we got it expected much more but spent  on a new screen and then found out that the phone was warped not in the condition that it was promised very disappointed will not buy from here again,1

this phone is worth  bucks and works great with cricket wireless i have no problems with it and the camera is perfect this is a great phone to buy i was skeptical of buying it at first but the phone proved me otherwise i would definitely buy it,5
i jus got this item yesterday it was properly packaged and it came with the items this phone so beautiful its fast the camera quality is amazing and games run great on in id recommend u get this phone asap,5
awesome phone for the price beautiful display great camera and audio the fingerprint isnt great though and face scans its not as fast but if you are willing to live with that you can save a lot of money and still have a great phone,5
this phone is almost the same as a samsung galaxy  it has  cameras on the back face recognition and finger print this is a big big jump from me from a samsung galaxy j if you have metro or tmobile this phone is your best option,5
upgraded from a s active love my decision so far this phone is awesome i didnt want to pay for a s or note  i went with samsungs midgrade phones just opened it up and transfering everything was super easy so far i am very happy,5
the fingerprint reader is not that great i have not tested the face recognition yet the phone is fast and reliable i do not like the programmed ring tones the screen size is awesome its a overall great phone for  dollars,5
the media on this screen is awesome seeing this compared a normal phone screen is night and day i have a s plus and this point hone is rite on par with it i actually use it more so good job samsung about time,5
i havent used the fingerprint or face recognition feature the battery life is acceptable but doesnt last all day even though i dont use my phone that much overall im very happy with the camera feature,5
its a wonderful phone for a great price havent had any real problems other than the signal to the towers isnt as consistent metropcstmobile so while on my s id have g lte on this i get lte other than that its great,4
screen became black by it self after exactly  months phone was never dropped on floor i have tried all kind of troubleshootings recommended online nothing worked such disappointment as this international version has no warranty,1
im just getting the time to review this phone bought it for a friend and now apparently its not turning on and im all the way back home in jamaica  but it seemed to have been a nice phone  wasted my money,2
i really liked the a its really fast when loading the apps the battery is great i charge only at night the memory ram is good too and the processor as well one of the best smartphones from samsung,5
although its very large especially for women hands the phone is amazing it came on time and together with silicone case and screen protector plus sd card very nice bundle that saved me time to look for all separately im very happy with my a,5
bought this phone for my mom she loves it everything runs smooth and the battery could run couple days with one charged it also comes with super fast charger affordable price gets a high quality phone,5
no me gusta este teléfono las huellas dactilares fallan siempre cada rato cambio mis huellas y nunka los recnoce y en llamadas siempre se activa la pantalla es enfadoso porque pone en espera o pasa otra cosa,4
this time i got the right version and im very happy beautiful pearl hue to the blue color immediately ran g lte with my metro by tmobile sim received additional gb sd card definitely flagship quality,5
really love the phone does everything i need with good battery life but very disappointed with the fingerprint scanner still unreliable after the recent update i wish they would have stuck with the ir scanners,4
the software for camera is not up to the products price it is in many cases install by apk google camera is a better choice to get good pictures but it lacks of proper support and fingerprint unlock does not work properly in comparison with cheaper phones,4
i love my phone it came unocked as promised for metro pcs users the sim  slot is the one that will work you if you cant afford or dont want to pay for the samsung this phone more than makes up for it,4
for the price its worth buying it works well so far what i like about this phone is that its unlocked so you can go to whatever service you like without the hassle of dealing with the service company,5
el teléfono es hermoso a la vista y al tacto se siente bien en la mano la cámara es espectacular es rápido y fluido lo amé además llegó mucho antes de lo previsto y en excelentes condiciones caja sellada y nuevo,5
the only problem with this phone is i had to switch to a game carrier  and now my quality of service is not so great but i enjoy the phone and its deep blue color the best thing about this phone is its camera,5
ademas de cumplir las expectativas que tenia respecto al smartphone es muy cómodo amigable e intuitivo la cámara es fabulosa y de muy fácil uso totalmente recomendable ademas el moto one vision version xt tiene compatibilidad con todas las bandas de chile,5
took a minute to get used to the android after being an apple user for  years but it works just as nice as my iphone  did without the enormous price tag even better i can use it on any network it has dual sim cards and a slot for additional storage,5
i was very happy with it until it broke mine broke the nd day i after it was delivered it started some automatic update that i didnt want  it just stopped working  it cant be fixed i have no clue what happened  it has no warranty,1
the phone is over all good with a good camera however it does not have g capabilities i had searched for g on amazon and this came up but does not have it discovered that after it was out of the box,3
in the pics i posted i am in work and you could the place where i work has solid concrete walls steel beams and i could walk around the entire building and leave my phone at my spot and not a beat to what i am listening to,5
i was leery because this was my first renewed phone purchase this is only my second day of having the phone but so far so good phone had no scratches and connected successfully with straight talk it sure was nice to save  by going renewed vs new,5
never buy a renewed or refurbished phone it was a hard lesson learned i bought a refurbished iphone  months later the motherboard went defective and i couldnt make outgoing call or get incoming call never buy any renewed phone ever again,1

dont order from we deliver wireless we ordered  phones and only received  and its been a hassle to get ahold of them for a refund on the one phone however the phone does work and is what we ordered so just beaware if youre trying to order multiple,1

ive had it over a month now and everything works great it has no signs of ever being previously used came in plain white box with charger had protective clear plastic covering screen just like they come new,5
i got this phone little over a month and the screen started acting up from time to time the screen would move by it self behaves like someone touch the screen i did a manufacture reset and the issue still occurs,1
best phone ive ever had the camera is spot on very fast tons of memory i paid  i will never pay for a high dollar flagship phone again like the latest version of the big name brands this is a zero compromise alternative to the overpriced competition,5
this is a great phone all the features of this phone make it a grand upgrade from my old htc one m well worth the price seller included the brick adapter for north american v i am very happy with this purchase,5
touchscreen oh as craped your after a few months dhlaoe not work typing is howrprendoips horwredlous cant yyuouee typeas u can see want to throw in trashh donubot bmuyp btuuy buy iqtp ,1
i love love love my new galaxy a amazing features  an amazing price the only thing i might say negative is that the battery life is not that great and the charging cord is pretty short but otherwise outstanding and new headphones too im lit,5
antenna is very poor battery life is okay but doesnt last nearly as long as my old phone performance of apps are actually decent but the failure of basic text messages and phone calls cancel out all other positive aspects,2
i absolutely love this phone ive have only had it for a week and unfortunately the amazon case that i bought was not as protective as i thought it would be because it shattered the very time that it was dropped i am very disapointed but the phone is great,5
purchased this phone and all the menus were in spanish and therefore were not able to even activate it all the text from the seller was in english was never given any warning that everything would be in spanish never buying from this seller ever again,1
excellent device to use ui is similar to uptodaye samsung devices battery life works great biometric scanners are phenomenal was very skeptical in purchasing this device for a steady price it worth it,5
the phone overall is pretty good for the price the back plastic scratches very easily and the fingerprint reader is  but other than that i dont have a problem with the phone at all its very pretty and does what i need it to,5
phone looked goodhowever i stared it and it said sprint with the heading when i purchased the phone clearly said verizon bye bye amazon i will go back to ebay and buy a phone i wont trust this ever again to be correct,1
screen was a little scratched didnt come with original charger ive pushed it hard with lots of apps and its super fast fingerprint scanner isnt too great but apparently the non refurbished phones have the same issue,4
i needed a new phone upgrade and did a little research and found this   t i couldnt be happier the renewed product from amazon looks like a brand new phone i would recommend to anyone great value using this on att service with no problems thanks again,5
peace of mind when backed by  day warranty works good camera and speed upto the point if you are okay with previous year phone and most important save a few hundred bucks go for this you will not be dissappoited,5
didnt come with the required oneplus lighting charger came with some some lanovo charger that does not even give enough power to charge the phone drains while plugged in not worth it as the chargers costs makes this more expensive then all the others,1
box was already tampered with and looked like a returned item i need a brand new which is what i paid for the box seal itself was dirty and broken and phone almost slipped out of the box because of the seal,2
phone is great earbuds are pointless because they go quiet in one ear after a few months same thing happened with my galaxy note  earbuds they should just stop including them and stop updating the firmware for them,4
exelente producto con todos sus valores agregados que ningún otro smartphone te incluye y al mismo precio que otros gama alta la fluides del equipo es lo mejor junto con su autonomía la gran pantalla es exelente,5
although you might like the huge screen its definitely not worth  bucks there are other phones which are worth a lot less but have better battery life and camera this was my first samsung galaxy note and it was not as good as i expected it to be,3
my dad loves it already and he has yet to activate it good first impression to him considering he had an iphone s before i got him this phone if it turns out to be defective ill be sure to change this review but until then nice phone samsung well done,5
i had checked this phone before and its an excellent phone i like everything about this phone i have been a samsung user but before this phone i had the one plus and its a great phone but i decided to go back to what i like the most,5
fantastic phone arrived undamaged with box in perfect condition only concern was amazon delivered it a day early when i requested a certain day on purpose because id be home and instead it sat in the rain for an hour,5
its fully unlocked has a beautiful screen and response time is great i watched a few videos on customizing to my liking and i love the phone i bought the max space so its almost as nice as a laptop even nicer since it goes everywhere with me,5
this phone is the best phone ive ever had the battery life is amazing the pictures are phenomenal and i couldnt be happier it is heavier than im used to usually cant use one handed thats my only complaint,5
awesome phone loving the features especially the camera got the aura glow color is just beautiful bought as a bundle where i got the samsung earbuds and the samsung power bundle everything was just awesome,5
good and works fine purchased and got here quickly the box had no plastic wrap all over but it was scratch free brand new i just connected it at my sprint account in store free of charge so this works with cdma ,5
el teléfono no llego me tuvieron esperando demsaido tiempo fue todo un problema explicar que el el teléfono no llego y me cobraron por los audífonos que supuestamente era un obsequio por comprar el teléfono,1
blown away im not new to samsung galaxy phones but this is a major upgrade from my s love the s pen this phone replaces my laptop and has already made my life easier in  week im very happy with the unlocked phone from samsung through amazon,5
i have really enjoyed this phone simple to use and has plenty of power for awesome pictures and plenty of hard drive to keep up plus being unlocked it gives me the ability to only have the stuff i want on it and not a bunch of garbage,5
can i trade in the phone note  while its still in the box unopened with the s when it gets released or not also i am not going to be in the us will the us warranty given work outside the us if anything happens,5
this is an early review and i reserve the right to change it and probably will ive only had the phone for a couple days now but im absolutely amazed by everything so far and think it was worth every penny,5
switched from team iphone and so far do not miss it beautiful phone inside and out the battery life is amazing dont have to charge until the next morning i have small hands so i assumed the big screen would be an issue but with a pop socket its totally fine,5
i so love this phone has everything you need and more and the camera is unbelievable you need to buy this phone and yes it works with straight talk you just have to get a chip to transfer the service it was easy,5
i love my phone its easy to use similar to my previous phone and works great with my tmobile service i have found no issues and since my old phone was over  years old i appreciate new things mine did not have id buy again,5
the phone is super the camera is generally beyond praise came all packed in mica took complete with glass the glass is also excellent sent for a long time so it was three weeks but in any case the product is very satisfied,4
works perfect with the usa network carrier iam usingas well iam using my indian sim and it works well till datejust a issue of battery its draining bit quicker than my previous mobile so thats the reason i am giving  star,4
un serio problema bluetooth no conecta con altavoz sony srx si conecta lo hace pero sin audio sin embargo con otros bluetooth conectatiene desventajas con relación al mia que tuve anteriormente,4
love the design screen performance battery isnt very good  not for me at least  if you always have your phone in hand battery dies pretty steadily camera let me down most of all had a huawei x honor and its camera blew this one out of the water,4
i bought this phone to replace my lg v this phone has exceeded all my expectations it surpasses my lg v in everything including the camera which i never expected this to do great battery life i get two days with normal use,5
the phone has limited eligibility with american carriers so make sure itll work for you unfortunately i didnt and i like the phone on wifi but i need to make calls too im sending mine back unless i can find a suitable carrier,3
overall great value my only complaint is that the finger print sensor has a slightly higher latency than the mi a probably bc its inscreen its a tradeoff that doesnt feel worth it to me but its not bad still a very useable and relatively secure sensor,5
wireless service was unpredictable the bands used matched my area and i even received data but i was often unable to make calls if not for that i would have kept the phone would buy again at this price if i understood how to remedy the service issue,4
the phone just arrived very exciting tried to change my sim card to the devices imei but am told its in use are these phones stolen this is supposed to be brand new very disappointing should be zero stars,1
too much of complicated issues with call connectivity please check next xiaomi usa cannot care less for support since they claim that xiaomi does not sell phones in the us officially then amazon xiaomi sales are unauthorized,1

this is the phone to buy its just amazing totally worth the money screen battery performance price is all perfect could not have bought a better phone thank you samsung for making it thank you amazon for supplying it,5
quality of the camera is really good but the speaker is located at the bottom of the device its not at upper right corner which is closed to our ear  it was unlocked by the manufacturer but not compatible to all mobile carriers,5
excellent phone for the money a lot of features and storage compared to the competition would recommend installing google camera though as it is far superior to xioami stock camera android one phone so all updated are guaranteed for at least  software cycles,4
ive been using the a on att for a month now and love it feels like a flagship device the battery life is awesome the only thing i dislike about the phone is the fingerprint scanner it works about  of the time i use face unlock and it works great,5
fingerprint reader needs some work had to reinstall prints many times the dual sim works well for me as i travel a lot now i dont need to switch phones one phone has both sims for the countries i visit frequently,5
this phone is just great and it is amazing all what you get in this phone for the price you pay  gb storage  gb ram full screen good quality pictures i bet is the best phone you can get on this range it worths every single penny im glad to get this phone,5
great phone definitely getting a lot for the price you pay fast processor can have multiple windows openminimized when doing more than one thing camera is awesome along with audio battery life is impressive,5
this phone is amazing dont freak out if it doesnt register your phone service u just call your provider and they will activate it for you works great with metro pcs huge widescreen phone feels like an xl phone  mpxl selfie camera is so clear runs fast and smooth,5
the a is an excellent phone at a great price i very much pleased with the speed and the operation of the android software very quick and long lasting charge purchased it unlocked so i can easily move to any phone plan,5
the box containing a us version and accessories was a bit dusty which was concerning though there were no cosmetic damage thankfully i was able to register the us warranty overall the phone is great only problem is fingerprint sensor works  of the time,3
phone came defective amazon support tried to help then got connected to samsung support and they only wanted to repair it as if i had purchased a used device way to treat your customers samsung going back to lg,1
great price feels like a different world after being on a samsung s until now definitely worth the price camera is good only problem was that i was sent a microusb instead of the required usbc charger cord,4
unlike the few that had bad reviews on this device i had no issues at all with it support shipping compatibility none of these things had any issues definitely reccomend for a budget smartphone with decent specs a bang for your buck,5
item as described smooth running nice features unlocked and works with cricket wireless prepaid services had for a week now no glitches ir issues quick response just not led light to blink for notifications sadly,5
took the phone to my local verizon shop and setup was straight forward process took  minutes makes and accepts calls reliably with new sim card cant really talk of phone functionality yet just wanted to post this for any readers taking a shot in the dark,5
my samsung galaxy ae us version factory unlocked cell phone with gb could not be activated by several different carriers i had to return this product and request a refund im still without a phone today,1
the ad said phone was in good working condition it did not come witha sim card or the case that holds the card so the phone is not in working condition now i have to buy the holder in order to get the phone to work,2
i think for the price this phone is pretty amazing its fast sleek and has plenty of storage and battery life the fingerprint sensor could use some calibrating but overall i couldnt be happier with it,5
it works well and i like the phone it does not have a fingerprint reader like other samsung devices but it works and the battery life is decent it takes one of the newer round android chargers so the chargers last much longer than the older style of chargers,5
my previous phones lens was located in the upper center of the phone this lens is located in the corner which makes it difficult to hold the phone without blocking the lens it does not have a fingerprint reader as far as i can see otherwise the phone is fine,4
couldnt get the phone to work on verizon straight talk did get it to work with att and tmobile stuck with tmobile for better connection hardware and size of the phone is amazing for the price but i dont think this phone works with verizon tbh,4
i really like this phone the graphics is gorgeous took it to metro pcs and had them switch my lg stylo  to this phone work perfectly the wifi works i can download my apps and it super fast when charging,5
phone would not achieve greater than one bar reception when previous motorola phone almost always had full coveragesame carrier i was really looking forward getting back to samsung as motorola quality is subpar but now it appears samsung is headed that way too,1
for the price of around  usd this phone is a great buy the finger print scanner is fast screen is responsive call quality is good camera is decent i am very happy with this phone i am using it in the usa on cricket wireless works great,5
i have been using this phone for a little over a month and it offers everything a person could want in a cell phone great size for viewing e mails and outstanding camera and a solid value for its price point oh yes it does very well for calls and texts,5
the phone looks really good work really good the big problem is it wont work on a us network services i have metro by tmobile and i had no service at all my guess is its because its an international version,2
i have been pleased with the samsung a phone i cannot review any of the fancy things it may be able to do since i primarily use it as a phone gps and to take e few pictures my old phone wasoldso at this price the phone is great,5
stay away from this phone it began to malfunction within a couple of days text messages go astray and so does the time on the clock a little search online brought up a lot of people experiencing this same and similar problem since ,1
purchased for my mother great budget phone that is mostly fast and never runs out of juice screen is somewhat blurry though touchwiz interface also seems less snappy than other android phones overall great budget phone all around with just a few compromises,4
our son has worked at a cell phone store so he knows phones and says this is a good one my only problem was fedex dropping it by our side door didnt ring bell and when my husband went to step out he almost fell because of the box being right where you step down,5
the fingerprint reader isnt very reliable i hate that the battery is nonremovable and the sim slot is a little bit annoying month update  phone no longer charges the battery since battery cant be replaced this means is pretty much useless,2
i wasnt happy that the phone was programmed in spanish when i ordered it for my son  states away he got it and couldnt use it had the site informed me about the spanish i wouldnt have ordered it but i bought the identical phone at wal mj art and it worked great,1
i really love this phone excellent value for the money screen resolution is very good cameras take great photos battery life is great and charges quickly when it does need charging definitely worth the money would absolutely buy again,5
hands down the best value per dollar phone i ever had i bought the samsung j prime for  and this was only  more and so much better it blows my mind i will be looking at samsungs a series form now on rather than the s series,5
i bought this phone for my best friend in the caribbean as a surprise  i have to say it was an excellent choice when we video call i can see her very clear it receive good connection she doesnt have any problems with it so far she loves it,5
battery life is very good fast charge and can use it for hrs when i first receive my phone it was mute even playing and watching but after a while lf using it the sound improve idk why but the phone it good and good prize,3
only had it one day and cant really rate it very well yet but so far it seems like a good purchase time will tell if the battery lasts i havent done fingerprint reader or face recognition so i cant rate those,5
the processor is apparently weak not enough to handle games or fancy apps the phone however is good enough to handle almost all the essential jobs like calling taking photos listening to music navigating etc,3
my lg v kept loosing battery life and that was the price i paid when i bought a refurbished phone i wont make that mistake twice really happy since finding this a galaxy still learning what it can do great price for this kind of technology,4
the phone is better than expected for the price looks great maybe a little slower than my old phone but not by much still getting used to it but so far i like it arrived fast as described no complaints,3
i love it so far i have noticed a lack of response to touch here and there like others have mentioned but otherwise i love this phone it had an amazing battery life and the screen is beyond beautiful i definitely recommend,5
the a line of samsung phones is a hidden gem in a world where average phones cost  these phones perform much closer to the flagship phones than the price tag would indicate i highly recommend this phone,5
i had originally ordered the as but cancelled and decided to go with the a after watching some youtube comparison videos the colors are vibrant and user friendly wanted a newupdated phone without spending too much without compromising quality love it,5
to be honest at the beginning of using this phone i dint like the fact that it was missing some of my favorite samsung flagships features like samsung wallet but after using it for a few month i noticed that it has been a really good phone for what it cost,4
even though the phone was unlocked from samsung and cdma was the correct service for my carrier this phone would not communicate with my carrier i was pasted my  days of return so i have to find a carrier that will work with this phone,1
just got it great phone so far even better than expected one thing tho the phone is alot bigger than i expected and i have big hands and even i have difficulty reaching the top of the screen not really a deal breaker just something to note,5
calls cut in and outdifficult to hold a conversation frequent disconnection of calls echoing of voice by calls made with phone lengthy charging time phone charger cable  which is  inches shorter than other types screen display good quality,2
really bad quality phone never expected that from samsung brand looks like a fake one  my screen cracked in two days after i received  was shocked to see that as i didnt drop it  dont buy this phone looks a good deal but waste of time,1

the charger did not work. My parents started using the cable directly to the phone,3
good quality phone,5
does not work well with T-Mobile. T-Mobile closes off some towers to non-T-Mobile phones.,2
This is a really great phone. I am visually impaired and have no problem with it. Will be getting another one for my partner.,5
More complicated than I expected. Terrible reception. Too hard for my mom to use. Just frustrates her.,1
No internet,3
phone reception poor with incoming calls,1
The sleek design and easy of use is what makes this phone really good. The large text is a plus,5
My husband loves it!! It is simple to use with large numbers. The simpler the better for him.,5
The only reason I gave it a 3 star is because it is a little hard for a elder person to use.,3
works good for 3G and above. Simple to use. No frills.,5
Sounds like you are under water. It shuts off while you are on call.,2

easy to use. My mother is 78 but she can use it very well.,4
"The SIM card from the provider would not work in this phone, so I am returning the phone.",2
simple to use. Does not seem to get tiem updates from AT&T,4
Phone number comes with DAILY SPAM Calls. Really annoying .. The phone is good.,3
"Good phone for my mom, big numbers, however settings are somewhat confusing.",4
Locks accidentally when used. Screen is too small to read text message. NOT easy to use for an elderly person.,1
It's a good phone for emergencies and the numbers are nice and big. Easy to use. Thank You so much,5
but did not work with Iwirless,4
Does not have Cyrillic! That was a surprize,4
We bought the phone for my 92 year old mother who is hearing impaired. She could not hear well on it at all.,2
As arrival of this phone and I couldn't charge it its so frustrating,2
"Looks good, as advertised, instructions not easy to follow. Keys are quite large and fairly easy to see.",4
My Dad loves it - works great with no confusing bells and whistles,5
Very bad same week i bought could not turn on / offNot worth the hassle don't buy it,1
Both of my grandmas love it!!! It could have a bigger screen and more ringtones,4
It's just what we were looking for,5
"Mom doesn't like any kind of change, so it has taken some time and effort to get her to embrace this versus her old flip phone.",5

These seem to be the same as the original at a much lower price.,5
"My husband breaks his otter box belt clip about every 5 to 6 months, so it was great to get this pack of 3. It fit perfect with his otter box.",5
Seems to work fine,5
"Look, feel, and fit like the original, but pressed in *China* instead of *Mexico*. No complaints.",5
"Clearly a knock-off. First one snapped after 2 weeks, but for a couple of bucks each, not unexpected.",2
you only got me two belt clip and one not functioner properly.,1

I bought what I thought was a new phone and instead was sent a stolen or lost phone. Gave this to my mom for Mother's Day. Felt terrible.,1
"It was a great price. However, it does not have a slot for a sim card on the side. Aside from that, it is good.",3

Great Value,5
Returned it.,1
I thought it would have come with a sim card,4
Had a few problems with OS and had to replace battery after 2 years of use.,4
I received it right,4
the item seems great thanks.,4
The phone didn't work. I had to go through my insurance to get a new phone that worked and it cost me another $160,1
"the product is very newly,i very like it ,i think it is a good product,it can become my best phone",5
"The WIFI has a problem，can`t work.and the battery is very bad,only can work a few hours. is a bad shopping.",2
The only problems is: The I-phone doesn't continue to remind you that you missed a telephone call. The ring tone could be elevated. It is too soft.,5
I recieved the phone and it only worked for about a month then it wouldnt ring on the phone text or alarm settings.,2
they said phone is new but registered from someone else and phone is broken and screen has been changed!!,1
Microphone doesn't work to make or receive calls,1
I was replacing a lost 4s and this was exactly the thing I needed. Good description and the unit performs well.,5

How can one write a bad review of the 4S iphone? It works. It works. It works for me anyway.,5

"Product arrived on time and looks as good as new, my daughter loves it and I couldn't be happier with the purchase",5

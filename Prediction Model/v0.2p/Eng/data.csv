Home button barely works fresh out of the box. Falsely advertised as new,1
"Good condition and love it, I recomend, Not the best deal $300 but its fair.I don't want any contract and new is too expensive",4

"Nice phone, delivered with apple charger and cord. Using it right now.",4
Product was not unlocked so we couldn't use it and had to return it. Very disappointed,2
Total waste of money won't connect to anything cellular and wifi. Ugh so frustrating it's by far my worst Amazon purchase to date.,1
90 days isn't enough. It DIED and was a waste of money. VERY disappointed,1
Worked for a few weeks then went out can't be repaired. A hardware issue. Had to replace it.,1
The battery was just horrible. But the seller was easy to work with on a return,3
"battery was not that good, need to charge twice a day.very narrow screen.",3
It's a great replacement for another iPhone. It does the job at a great price.,5
Phone was in perfect condition on arrival. Worked exactly as stated. All I did was pop my SIM card in and bam all done.,5
Easily transitioned father from old smart phones to this one through our ATT service. No issues.,5
I should of listened to everyone else that said the battery is terrible. It dies within an hour after a full charge.,1
Purchased the phone in February and it died today April 14. Exactly a month from its return window. Save your money!,1

"Exactly what I expected and has worked out perfectly. It got here earlier than expected and have had absolutely no problems,",5
"Ear piece doesn't work, we have to use the speaker to hear the caller.",2
I bought the iphone 4s two months ago and no longer works so useless that is cheap if not hard so I'm very upset with my purchase,1
Seemed just like new. Works fine and a great value! Check here first if you need a new phone!,5
I bought this phone and I sent it to my sister in venezuela and she can't use it because IT'S NOT UNLOCKED. How can I solve this?,1

"phone is good work in Ukraine, but charge included for iphone 5! not compatible for this iphone 4s",4
iPhone is flawless. But the battery doesn't stay long. Only 12hrs standby long. Have to return it. And bought 5c instead.,3

This phone fits my needs perfectly. I have a pay as you go plan and I only use Apple phones. Good price for an Apple phone.,5
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. IT DOESN'T WORK WITH VERIZON OR A&T. Had to return it.,1
The phone only works with a US SIM card. So it is not unlocked for non US SIM cards. This was not mention in the description,1
"I have used my IPhone 4s until now, but, I'm tried to open this morning. It does not open, I don't why",3
After less than 60 days stopped working. Stuck on the Apple logo then turns off.,1
The battery does not stay charged long enough . In the phone The phone gets hot all the time,3
"not good at all. charger not working . app store doesn't open, I will be replacing this once soon.",1
You sold a phone that the battery won't stay charged for longer then an hour,1
Very nice iPhone. Refurbished like new. Popular apps good for a starter iPhone,5

Do NOT buy this product from this vendor. It never worked to connect wifi and battery was already worn out.,1

"The battery doesn't lasts. Wifi is not functional, I can't connect to a router. Only 3G/LTE.",2
"I'm so glad with this order about everything, from the product to its price and delivery time as well. Strongly recommended.",5
Wi-Fi did not work and battery would not hold charge. This unit was supposed to be re-certified guaranteed,1
"It looks brand-new, no visual flaws or scars, functions well. No complains yet.",4
This phone did not maintain its charge more than 2 hours and after a month it died never to turn on again.,1
Great deliviry! Got it within 2 days and I bought it over the weekend. Phone works perfectly,5
90 days isn't enough. It DIED and was a waste of money. VERY disappointed,1
Worked for a few weeks then went out can't be repaired. A hardware issue. Had to replace it.,1
The battery was just horrible. But the seller was easy to work with on a return,3
"battery was not that good, need to charge twice a day.very narrow screen.",3
I bought the iphone 4s two months ago and no longer works so useless that is cheap if not hard so I'm very upset with my purchase,1
Seemed just like new. Works fine and a great value! Check here first if you need a new phone!,5
"Had to return as it was not ""unlocked"" ... would only work with AT&T .....",1
I bought this phone and I sent it to my sister in venezuela and she can't use it because IT'S NOT UNLOCKED. How can I solve this?,1
Phone looked worn and had lots of stratches. Bad condition - unacceptable.,1

Whole experience was great. Product was totally as described and worked great.,5
Good! Works great! the box is very simple... And the charger is not a cube like apple,5
"We bought the cellphone and less than 3 months after it presents a problem, it can't connect to the internet wi-fi.",1
Fast delivery. And so far works like a brand new phone. It came in perfect condition.,5
Terrible - won't hold a charge. Refurbished nightmare - if we hadn't been in such a bind I never would have bought this,1
"buy 2 , one would run a few weeks the wifi and then stopped when I wanted to make a claim had already spent time replacement",2
Phone was in excellent physical condition. So far all functionally has worked without problems.,5

The only bad thing about it was that it had 12GB. When it said it had 16GB.,3
"Holding right now, took a friggen week to get it, supposed to be unlocked, it aint, verizon phone, gonna try again to get service.",1
Product was not unlocked so we couldn't use it and had to return it. Very disappointed,2
Total waste of money won't connect to anything cellular and wifi. Ugh so frustrating it's by far my worst Amazon purchase to date.,1
Was suppose t be unlocked but showed up locked and way more scratches than it was portrayed not very happy may have to return,1
"So happy with the 4s! It fits with my other Apple items to charge easily, however, it does not hold the charge long.",5

Something is wrong with the power connection. It does not change right.,1
It was a great phone too bad it got stolen from my purse at waltmart the next day :(,5

"Claims to come with all original accessories, did not. Just thrown in a random box.",1
"Battery power is horrible. Even with all settings set to save power, it rarely makes it through the day.",1

"The iPhone works great, the problem is it takes too long to charge about 6 hrs and only charges when turned off.",3
"Whoever ""refurbished"" it did a horrible job, the battery would die off within a few minutes, wouldn't hold a charge. Returned it",1
The phone holds a very poor charge dies on 40% battery life and the home button spins very poor excuse for a certified phons,1
"It doesn't work, I can't hear anyone, it doesn't ring. And I can't make outgoing calls, or turn up the ringer.",1

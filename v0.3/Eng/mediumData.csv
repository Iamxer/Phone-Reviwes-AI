"Great phone to replace my lost phone. The only thing is the volume up button does not work, but I can still go into settings to adjust. Other than that, it does the job until I am eligible to upgrade my phone again.Thaanks!",4
The charging port was loose. I got that soldered in. Then needed a new battery as well. $100 later (not including cost of purchase) I have a usable phone. The phone should not have been sold in the state it was in.,2
"Phone looks good but wouldn't stay charged, had to buy new battery. Still couldn't stay charged long.so I trashed it.MONEY lost, never again will I buy from this person! !!!",2
It's battery life is great. It's very responsive to touch. The only issue is that sometimes the screen goes black and you have to press the top button several times to get the screen to re-illuminate.,3
"My fiance had this phone previously, but caused many problems. So, of course, we decided to browse amazon for a replacement til' our contract is up! & so far so good!",3
"This is a great product it came after two days of ordering it. There was only one little blemish on the side,but who cares as long as the phone is fullly functional.i recommend this product to anyone reading this.",5
These guys are the best! I had a little situation with my item but they quickly fixed the issue. I was pleased and will definitely be buying another phon from them if I need one.,5
"Had this phone before and loved it but was not working so I got this phone. One thing is the SD card slot does not open up when I try to access it in file managment, even does not show up on the computer. The card is fine was able to open on another phone. Trying to trouble shoot it for now.",2
"I was able to get the phone I previously owned...with a keyboard and touch screen. It's the best phone and I love it. I still had to clean the device with my service provider, but it was well worth it.",5
"I brought this phone as a replacement for my daughter, who is very hard on cell phones. I must say it was a great purchase. The phone work wonderful. Thank you",5
I love the phone. It does everything I need and works great. I purchased four of these phones through a seller that shipped from Amazon's warehouse. My only problem is that the phone didn't come with a micro sd card. I couldn't use the camera until I got the card. No problems getting these activated at Sprint.,4
"unfortunately Sprint could not activate the phone due to the blocking issue with the phone, the matter was handled very well and quickly. Very satisfied with the service.",3
"pros-beautiful screen,capable of running chrome,take good pictures,the keyboard is comfy,fits in my pocket and fit my hands,plays really good videos and gamescons-no Bluetooth,came late,run down fast really quick,doesnt play 1080p videos.but I would still recommend it to those who like to talk and text a lot like me and watch a lot of movies",4
"the reasons for the 3 star rating was it was in my opinion better than my iphone 4s but it tends to randomly crash, and randomly power off but it is good for storage space, battery usage, and camera",3
"Just... not good. The phone has great screen resolution, storage is low, you need an SD card to do anything. May have a clear ESN but don't expect to use it with things like Freedompop.",1
"This phone is trapped in 2001, if you want a simple phone get an old school flip phone. If you want something also for work get a blackberry or somthing new. This isn't even in the middle of those two, it's in another dimension. Nothing but frustration with this phone.",2
"Nokia is the brand that can be used in telephone, good price, excellent team, was a gift to my daughter and she liked it, easy to use and very affordable price, I recommend it.",5
"Nokia Asha 302 Unlocked GSM Phone with 3.2MP Camera, Video, QWERTYDependableTraditional Nokia Menu'sNot Complicated like 'Smart Phones'DurableEasy to use on Straighttalk, Internet, WiFi, Bluetooth.",5
"Hola, compramos dos teléfonos y vienieron totalente diferentes, uno vino con la batería dañada, se descarga de inmediato. El otro teléfono vino sin la tarjeta de memoria y los teclados y cargadores son muy distintos.Mi Tía y yo nos sentimos engañadas y defraudadas :(",1
"THIS CELLPHONE IS VERY EASY FOR USING, IT HAS COMPLETE APPS FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTACT WITH OTHER PEOPLE, MOST OF THEM ARE INCORPORATED AND I JUST HAD TO USE IT WITH WI FI CONNECTION, I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASED IT IS A SIMPLE PHONE BUT COMPLETE AND IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT...",5
Freezes alot. But i bought primarily for playing back my music instead of my BB. Its a great phone for SMS and rings really loud. The body is strong and neat,4
"We just received the phone a few days ago. Put in the Consumer Cellular SIM card, and it is ready to go. The phone seems very nice even though we have not come close to discovering all of the things it will do. It has a large number of ring tones built in.",5
THIS IS A SOLUTION IF YOU WANT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ECONOMIC AND NOT VERY SOPHISTICATED. YOUR PRICE IS A GOOD CHOICE FOR THE PRODUCT THAT RECEIVE.rECOMMEND IT,5
"Have problems setting correct time on Nokia Asha 302. Customer support on Nokia.com does not accept inquiry about Asha 302 phones. Is this product obsolete, or is Nokia customer support poor? Booklet that came with phone is also poorly written.",3
"This is a good phone although it seems to have a small screen. However, it's capable of performing all the basic functions such as calling, messaging, web browsing, social networking and it also has a wi-fi capability.",4
Sorry it took so long to Reply or Review this purchase as it over 18 months.This Phone was a Clone Phone from Hong Kong--The quality is Fair--ALL THE SYMBOLS DON'T MATCH--such as \ ? !--But the phone works I think amazon should Boycott this Seller.,2
"This cell phone exceeded my expectations, it's user friendly & everything works like they said it would. The price is amazingly cheap. The features are enormous & helpful.",4
"Phone works great, looks great and shipped quiet quickly only issue is can with a European Charger so had to purchase micro-usb to usb cable to charge phone which I would have had to do to download and update system any way.",4
"a pretty capable, durable texting phone, unlocked as advertised, but the version i received had arabic on the keys in addition to the typical ISO basic latin and many symbols missing, like ""!"".",3
"Excellent phone has all the special functions to be communicated with all social networks, excellent operational...I recommend it 100% excellent product",5
when i got phone it wouldn't work I took it to a Verizon store here the battery didn't work even when I charged it for 12 hrs Verizon put another used battery in phone it started to work,2
"All around good phone, not glitchy at all, or laggy. There are a fee problems such as the storage being very small (only 2gb) and the camera is very poor quality. I'm pretty certain that you can buy a Galaxy S 4 camera and install it to this phone. But all around this is a pretty great phone!",4
I have no problem taking the phone to straight talk.The phone came in about 3weeks. The only thing I didn't like was the camera its horrible when trying to get a take picture the pictures wasn't clear,4
"When I first got the phone it had a very poor camera and one day I hit my phone with a pencil and it turned off immediately. I do not like the phone whatsoever. I would not recommend getting this phone, especially if you like to take a lot of pictures or use a lot of apps. The storage is also very poor.",2
The phone works great but my charger outlet on phone is having to be fixed and the one they sent falls out and my phone doesnt charge with it. It will cost 55 dollars to have charger fixed before it messes the motherboard up. Thats almost as much as phone,3
"I bouht this phone for my 82 year old mother who has macular degeneration, she loves it. It is very easy and she can see the big numbers for dialing and such.",5
"[New Edition] Jethro [SC213V2] Flip Quad-band Unlocked GSM Senior & Kids Cell Phone, SOS Emergency Button, 2.4"" Large LCD with Large Keypad.A a nice phone, easy to operate and cost friendly. Its also light and so easily portable. You can use your micro sim and save your music and photos.",5
"good phone for my 82 year old dad who wanted a camera, but probably wouldn't be able to deal with an iphone. Needs a memory card for the camera to work though. It's nice you can set speed dials.",3
I bought this phone for my 91 year old aunt. It seems very easy for to use. Would certainly recommend it. Purchased another brand senior phone same price that didn't last 2 weeks due to quality of phone screen,5
I am very unhappy with the purchase. First of all I paid to have it shipped to me and then once I received it I found out from Staight talk that after 1/1/2017 that it would no longer work with ATT which is the only cell phone carrier that is my area. I was able to send it back but I have to pay the postage. I am not happy. Ken,1
I bought it for my elderly grandfather which is very vocal about everything we get him whether we like it or not. He likes the phone it's loud and it's simple. He doesn't need his glasses to use it. I was able to sync it with AT&T,5
"My Granny couldn't use the phone because she wasn't able to use the locking the phone function, and without the lock the phone called people when the phone was in her pocket. If the lock was easier for her, then this phone would be great.",2
"Not good sound, not easily used by senior, end button is also turn off button...so my elderly mom keeps turning off the phone!Will have to find her another one..,would not purchase this again.The purchase and delivery were as scheduled.",2
"Great simple to use phone for my mother. Big buttons, easy to see and use. She has the use of only one arm so the charge cradle is a great benefit. Easy setup, good clarity, gets good signal.",5
Returning product. The volume is absolutely abysmal. Even at maximum it is just audible to me. Bought this for my elderly mother: no way will she be able to hear anything ! For a phone marketed for the elderly this is a disgrace.,1
"I bought this phone for my grandma, it doesn't make or receive calls. I tried a manual selection of the network, and also a factory reset, and nothing happened, she has at&t.",2
The placement of the M1 and M2 buttons in particular made this too confusing for my elderly father to use. He tried numerous times to get the phone to turn on to make a simple call and could not get it to work. Now it now longer charges or comes on and he has only had it 6 weeks. Fortunately it didn't cost much but what a waste of money.,1
"I just not giving 5 stars because I don't know the durability. Everything else are just perfect. I does what it says. Call quality is good. SOS, Speed dial & direct dial works great. Quality of the phone is good. The docking station have some issue but no issue with direct charging, I still rate 4 stars because everything else are just perfect.",4
"It worked alright, until i qccidetly pushed the silent button (wich was not explained in miserable chinglish user guide.Then it completely stopped my incoming calls,and icound not reset it.",3
After reviewing my grandmothers bills I realized she was paying $115 a month for a jitterbug phone with unlimited talk (used 700 minutes a month) & text (never sent one). I bought this phone had AT&T add a no contract line to my plan for $20 a month and gave her this. Works great for her.,5

"The tablet really was not I was looking for the sim card did not work the sd card never read ,charger cord broke,I had to purchase another!!I""m really upset with this product...Really surprise me I wanted a tablet that would do all these things and more",1
Doesn't have Google Play even though picture and description says it does. I contacted E-passion. They were worse than useless. They kept telling me stupid stuff like install Google Play for the non existent app market. It was very obvious they didn't understand much English.,1
My friend brought it to me at work after i ordered it on Amazon as we work together overseas and i live in Johannesburg. When i got home and tested the phone the microphone doesnt work. So you can hear but no one can hear you. Now im stuck with it because how would i get ut back to Texas? Very unhappy with the product,1

This is my second sim card I have to use to activated this phone. I contacted the company and still no response. I'm currently doing more research on the matter. To early to rate cause I had this phone for two weeks.,1
Lots of nice features but touch response slow. Nice looking phone. I only use the phone for one week and I will write review again. Sound volume poor.,3
"They are wonderful. got them for my son as he tends to break them. now we have extras without going through hassle of ordering again!!! thanks for that, that rates 5 stars.",5
I bought the 3 pack and am still on the first one. Seems to be working well and hasn't broke. Holds my phone without all of the bulk of a leather flip case.,5
I purchased the 3 pack a few weeks back and I just broke the third one today. These are brittle and slightly smaller than they need to be to fit a defender case. My last Otterbox clip lasted over a year before it finally broke. I would not recommend this item.,1
Order these every 6 months for my husbands phone. He brakes the clip off theses are A good price and three of them helps keep me from ordering them every other month. They fit his case well and clip to his belt without any problems.,4
"Anybody with Otterbox knows that the belt clips break frequently. These clips last just as long as the brand name but at a much better price. Fast shipment, too.",5
"The phone is REALLY slow. It doesn't have enough internal memory. It frequently freezes up because it just doesn't have enough memory to handle the apps. It's okay, but if I'd known I'd have so many problems with it, I would have bought a different phone.",3
Bought for my son and got connection thru Consumer Cellular as an add on line. Works fine for all included functions and hasn't given any problems yet (~ 1 year so far). I'd buy it again.,4
"At first I thought it was not charging but, there was a small plastic strip over the battery that I needed to remove. After I removed it, the phone worked great!",4
This phone is horrible. Speaker doesn't work right. Can only have 1 app never again will I buy this phone. I will never recommend it to anyone. The only thing nice about it is that its cheap. If I could give this phone no stars I would...,1
"Got it so I could test an Android app. It worked well and I had no issues with the software or hardware. The limited memory forced me to buy an SD card to really use it, but it was still worth it for the price I paid.",5
This phone worked well for phone calls. Very small internal memory could only have one App downloaded. Could not send or recieve MMS . The battery portal broke after only owning for 4 momths. Also had to reset often and wifi very slow. If you are going over seas and just need to make calls it's a good phone but not for everyday use!!,2
"I got it, took forever to turn on, has only 300megabytes of internal storage even with a 64gig SD card, and the quality is extremely terrible. Do not buy unless you want to waste your money on junk.",1
If I could've gave it 0 stars I would have!!!! Awful phone!!! Never by from this seller again!! Phone is not up to USA standards. Maybe good across seas. But not what we're use to.,1
I am disappointed with The screen I love purple flowers I don't see I want to return back this phone i don't feel like using it s not same color either n also I am having hard time opening to insert the sim,2
"I never got the thing to turn on. It would take a charge. I had low expectations considering the price, I just wanted to use it as a back up for running credit cards using Square but that isn't going to work out. Returning it.",1
This product is expensive for the quality. At $20 it might be worth it...maybe. You are better off adding a little extra and getting a used second or third generation galaxy or iphone. It will definitely last longer. Regret this purchase. Screen just went south after about 1 week of use. Also the screen quality is not ideal.,1
it says T-Mobile compatible; however my sim card once inserted didn't connect at all. it would say sim not connecting to network. great price but I couldn't do nothing more then use the phone when Wi-Fi was avail. no calling out services when away from home. over all the phone was cute. but needed it for me then apps at home.,2
"Its a cheap phone, but I thought I gave it a try. I guess for what I wanted it, wasn't good. It has very low Internal memory and lots of Ads thrown at you! It also freezes quite a bit. I guess its good if you only want to use it to talk and travel with it because it has a dual sim card slots.",2
"The phone is REALLY slow. It doesn't have enough internal memory. It frequently freezes up because it just doesn't have enough memory to handle the apps. It's okay, but if I'd known I'd have so many problems with it, I would have bought a different phone.",3
"I took this phone all through Mexico with me, and I surfed the web, and made calls (VoIP and regular) and this phone was heroic. The camera isn't bad either.",5
"Was hoping for a decent phone for this price! Was a gift for my niece, every time she used it the phone repeatedly dropped calls! Was an at&t prepaid account was in an area with a strong signal so it wasneeds the carrier. Had to buy another phone!!!",1

I ended up returning this phone. When I put the sim card in it did not stop and went into the phone where I could not reach it. Had to use my tiny screwdrivers to take the phone apart and retrieve the SIM card. This phone also lacks space for apps and updates.,1
"I got it, took forever to turn on, has only 300megabytes of internal storage even with a 64gig SD card, and the quality is extremely terrible. Do not buy unless you want to waste your money on junk.",1
Don't waste your money. This is the cheapest phone ever! Does not save to SD card for downloads and can only download a few things on internal hard drive. If there were 0 stars I would give left that!,1
This phone has a good touching. The screen shows good under a lighter application theme which up to the HD screen to a certain extent. Its battery lasts a long time and has a good sound quality.,5
"The phone looks very beautiful and has a high configuration. The pictures are very clear as well as the calls. It runs fast and features high cost performance. In short, the overall conditions are good and it suits me well.",5

"This phone gives me a good experience. It has a pretty appearance, compact structure and convenient operation. By the way, the simplicity of design and the good quality attract me the most.",5
"I put it into use as soon as I received it. It is a real good thing which matchs for its price. The workmanship is very fine and it possesses an elegant appearance and human-oriented design. By the way, the packaging is combined with conciseness and simplification.",5

This phone integrates cellular connectivity and WiFi. The sharpness of the display and navigation with wifi is impressively good. It works good even without a SIM card. ,5
"I am happy with most of the characteristics of this mobile. except for:1. its wifi connection. For some reason it does not perform well when compared to other devices connected to the same wifi signal2. its 3G is not working well, at least in Argentina. far too slowCamera is great, Processor fast. Do not expect a slim model though!",3
Like phone its nice for price sometimes it get a little to hot only thing I didn't like is that it went to factory mode for a day didn't work bit other then that phone was great for price,5
I bought this to replace my samsung galaxy s3 and this phone has went above an beyond my expectations. It works the same if not better than my Samsung did for more than half the price. I would def purchase again,5
"It was slow, but worked fine. However after only 2 weeks it wouldn't charge. After diagonosis, it was charging port that was defective and could not be repaired. May be just this one i received. I ended up returning the phone.",2
"It was advertised as being unlocked and compatible with AT&T- It didn't work with my sim card and when I took it into the AT&T store they tried there and weren't able to get it to work either, so I had to return it. Frustrating experience.",1
I don't know about other phone carriers but this phone does not work with T-Mobile. Calls out and calls coming in work maybe 1/10 times. The signal is terrible. Sad I can't use it when it's such a pretty phone. Will be returning this phone.,1
"the phone is very good for the price, does it right, the wifi has a good reach, the games run fast for a majority, good design, the gps works ok.como I have my bad coverage 4g mobile operator can not prove all rightconsthe sound leaves much to be desired, very badstill no stable version for andoid 5.0 to date,as I have seen are working on it.",4

Positive: Large screen is good for senior people. Cheap. Maybe ok for those people who don't use phone quite oftenNegative: doesn't cover WCDMA band in US. Only supports GSM network in US though it says WCDMA. Runs quite slow so that I have to slow down entering characters...,2
"I ordered two of these based on the reviews..however I am very disappointed as they don't work as advertised, especially the camera and video functionality. I do not recommend and will be returning them.",2
Didnt offer clear and concise instructions on how to put in a sim card. I got bad eyesight so i put in a microsim in the sim slot. Tried to remove it with tweezers now the phone wont power on,1

Worst phone ever... not only you can’t find a case but if it falls once it will crack and you won’t be able to use it. I tried to sell it on one of those machines at Walmart and it won’t even recognize the device. DO NOT BUY!!!,1
Phone is cheap...only had it for 3-5 months n it already stopped working. Could download anything because the memory sucked. Don't waste your time and money on this phone.,1

Good phone but easy to break screen.This thing is also full of ads.Which Burns up your data plan.I wish there was a way to kill the ads.I think it is part of the interface.I had to reset it about every Two weeks.The ads eat up your memory on your phone to.Nice phone just to many flaws in it.,3
Wow!!!😱It the best phone ever. I got a case and a screen protector and my games show clear along with a nice camera but it will be best to take a picture outside so u can see it better😊,5

Good phone but easy to break screen.This thing is also full of ads.Which Burns up your data plan.I wish there was a way to kill the ads.I think it is part of the interface.I had to reset it about every Two weeks.The ads eat up your memory on your phone to.Nice phone just to many flaws in it.,3

Positive: Large screen is good for senior people. Cheap. Maybe ok for those people who don't use phone quite oftenNegative: doesn't cover WCDMA band in US. Only supports GSM network in US though it says WCDMA. Runs quite slow so that I have to slow down entering characters...,2
"I ordered two of these based on the reviews..however I am very disappointed as they don't work as advertised, especially the camera and video functionality. I do not recommend and will be returning them.",2

"The screen color quality is crisp as most leading brands. The volume is loud in ear & the speakerphone as well ( I like ) The only thing I dislike is all the China Apps installed. I've disabled most & there are a few things that still have the chinese language, however, considering the processing speed, screen clarity, & price, I'm keeping it :)",4
the product is good but the English language still have settings showing in Chinese and its does not have google play.is there any change you provide more details on how I can get full version to download in English that I can install in the phones?,2

"I sent the phone to Colombia, and They had to change the battery because the one the phone came with, did not work. They had to pay almost $50 to replace it.The phone is working as expected after that.",3
"Didn't have the color that originally wanted when the product shipped out. The white one seem to have ran out of stock just as I ordered it a week ago. Got a knock off version instead. I was expecting the original Lenovo phone however, as a gift to my baby sister she enjoyed the cute features.",2
"I did not like the phone worked only 03 days , it turns on and off alone without emitting any action on my part. Do not waste your money on this option",1

this phone has poor talk quality and it is not a 3g phone itis a 2g phone i called at&t to have them send me a new sim they asked for a imei # when i gave it to them them told me that is was 2g and they do not used 2g phone anymore and the internet is slow that is because it is a edge network not 3g!!!! overall the phone is a 3 out of 10,2
"I like this smartphone, good quality very very smartphone, the color, pretty, 5.5 inch perfect in the hand, I recomend this smartphone very very smart. Thank a Amazon and the other seller of china.",5
The biggest downside to this phone is from China. It looks great. I've been using it about a week and already having charging/battery issues. Its definitely going back!,1
The size of phone is good fast enough and convenient for Every day use and also fits in average hand.The battery is not very strong and Wireless is looking weak.if you need a phone for both talk and internet This is a very Economical option.venkata,3
"Positive Sides : Big screen, very nice colours , not bad camera for 5MP, fast in work, perfect body quality, long battery life, low priceNegative Sides : NOT LOADED WITH GOOGLE PLAY, a lot of chinese apps and some of them you can't uninstall (but you can root it to English or another language, if you have such knowledge)",5
The delivery was earlier than expected and the cellphone is extremely fast. I have yet to experience trouble with it. This is the best cellphone I have ever bought!,5
Way better than my iphone 4. It feels like a phone but works like a tablet. Very fast and plenty of memory (with a 32gb card). It doesn't have the usual characteristics of a Chinese product. Fells like an LG.,5
my daughter seens to like this phone. it belong to her. she said she cant download facebook. this could be because her memory cards has too much on it. something needs to be deleted.,4
I really like the phone it what I want. I am Jamaica it shuts off with Noone touching it. The chinese is a huge problem I am returning it the sim card setup the shut downs...,3
"I think that i can repair the phone with 50$ that they give to me but not, the phone just doesn't work at all, with anything turn on, i just hate it, is the worst phone that i ever had! Doesn't buy this, all of plastic and aluminium. Is a Stole",1
The phone is lighting fast however it only allows you to change language settings to English and Chinese it wasn't routed in Goole play store it has a lenovo store that is in Chinese. Won't buy again. Amazon try to help but wasn't any help to me.,1
"Best Price-Value benefit, you have to deal with some chinese at the Lenovo on the Built-in apps, but 99.99% it's english and Lenovo it's a Great Brand",5
When I first got the phone it was not charging so I had to email the company to see if they could help me on learning how to charge the phone. The company did emailed me back and now the phone is working fine. I had to take it to my phone company so they can help me set it up right. Some things are in Chinese.,4
"Don't buy this phone, I have a lot of issues with it such as: extremely slow, it takes a long time to open up apps ex. internet, messages and also the phone; volume, putting the phone on speaker doesn't help because you still won't be able to hear on it.",1
"Worst phone. Don't ever get this product. after using it for a few months l cant even charge it any more. I got two ,one for me and one for my husband and either phone is working now. my money just went down the toilet.",1
I've had the phone for one month. It is already turning itself on and having trouble turning back on. The port to charge it is messed up and no charger will hardly stay connected. The camera is AWFUL. The pictures are terrible and the flash doesn't work. I have never been so upset in a phone purchase in all my life.,1

"IF IS A SMARTPHONE EXCELLENT dig a little, IN SETTINGS YOU CAN CHANGE THE LANGUAGE TO ENGLISH OR SPANISH, IS QUICK AND HAS A LONG LIFE BATTERY AND IF YOU RECOMMEND GOOGLE PLAY LE MANS",4
Little visibility in light environments like outside in the shadow.Battery life could be better. It have a big screen which is very good for reading texts.,4
"The cell phone arrived several days before that the expected.The Mobil work excellent. It is fast, big and the screen looks very good. The only problem is the camera during the night, isn't good.But for the price, I think, is a good Mobil.",4
"This phone is 2G, even add says 3G, so internet runs super slow. The Second sim card does not work properly, its shame cause its a nice phone but with a few details. If you are using for calls, text and WiFi its OK.",2
"It's not the most up to date phone only Android 4.2. And it has other flaws. But for only 100 bucks, it is unbeatable quality. Beautiful design and it can easily pass for a phone that costs $300. Lenovo is a recognizable brand, so i trust that it is more durable than most no name cheap phones",5
"The mobile is very good, there are only small details that make such uncomfortable using the button to activate the screen is in an awkward position. Otherwise very sastifecho.",5
"The phone is quite big, and perfect for my dad. He mostly use the phone to play Candy Crush and send texts and he totally loves it! It's fast and a perfect deal for the price.",5
"it's a good phone, but sent defective. No sound when they call, so should only be used with headphones and is not ideal. I have to take it in for repair.",2
"Nice product and reasonable shipping speed. Language setting was somewhat a challenge as the the initial language was ""Greek"", but with the help of Google Translator, it was changed to English eventually.",5

"Thank you for you gifts that you sent in the package Screen protectorGood Performance, Touchscreen/Display OKGoogle Play Store and apps are working without any problem.Perfect usable as smartphone/tablet combination: 2 in 1 device",5
"This is a good smart phone ,First of all the device is fast ""NO LAGGING""The software nice ,battery life more than accepted for daily use.Feels good in the hand ,but the camera not really what I expected.For the cost it is a great deal. (Quad core + 1GB RAM + Big screen +not bad camera + nice finishing and style ).",4

"The screen stopped working hours after the delivery, the camera sucks, it's slow, it was bigger than expected, and there is very low storage to begin with. Never get this phone, I'll be sending mine back to the company for a refund if you have the phone or want it, don't.",1
"The phone is amazing other than the worthless camera. I used to love this phone but now I hate it, it downloads apps on it's own and it has a virus on it. Don't buy this phone its not worth it.",1
The phone I receive would not read my verizon chip when I place it in the Slot. And while trying to send it back it costs me $25.00 to send it back to Seller in China. And I really need me another phone. Thanks JessicaYou may contact me at 843-709-3118,1
"Supposed to be a brand new unlock phone. The phone is no good, seem to be used and didnt work like a brand new phone at all. I dont recommend this phone to no one. Touch screen didnt work at all, you cant even reset the phone at all. Had it for 1 day and returning it now",1
"This phone is a generic piece of garbage sent driectly from China. No way to return it. I have barely used it, have no photos, videos, or music, etc., and keep getting an error message that the internal storage is running out and I need to free up some space. The message prevents me from using the phone. DON'T BUY ONE OF THESE!!!!!!!!!",1
These phones do not receive the internet at all do not buy them internet do not come in Metro PCS will not activate them the SIM code is fake do not buy them phones have been stolen that is why internet will not work Sam coats are fake do not buy them can't stress it enough do not,1
this phone is buggie i got it for me and my boyfriend because some people in the reviews was saying its a good phone. we hate this phone and is very soon getting a new oneit pops up random addswont stay connected to internetturns on and off by its selfand much more,1
This item is nothing what is suppose to be at all. Very dissapointed in this product you can not use internet now Wi-Fi norCalls or texts. Very dissatisfied,1
"This phone does work on walmart family moble, HOWEVER, it is very slow, downloads random apps that I never even a proved. If I had known the phone was going to be like this I would never wasted 80$ on it. This is what I get for trying to go the cheep route.",2
After 3 days the screen on this phone stopped working and I'm very pissed off !!!!! There is no way to contact the seller to try another one and send this one back. Now I don't have a phone !! I wasted my money !!!,1
This phone looks nice but its only 2g. When I tried to use this phone with my phone carrier it would not work.The 2g is tooo slow and even on wifi I could not go to the internet. This phone is crap and I felt like I had a flip phone that just looked nice.,2
"Bought as a Xmas present for wife. By the time she opened it, selected a carrier, got their SIM and installed it the return period was up. While inputting contacts she started getting porno popups. Tried to reset to factory setting but the Porn is ""deeply rooted"" so the phone may have come with the malware installed. Its trash!",1
"Worst phone i ever had. I literally had it for a month, and its toast. It downloads virus after virus ON ITS OWN! Camera sucks, and it takes forever to make and recieve calls. That's what i get for going the cheap route.. 👎👎👎",1
I bought 2 one for myself and one for my wife. They were great for the first two days then at the same time caught a virus that destroyed them instantly and we had to buy new phones it was awful I wouldn't buy them again,1
This phone sucks the data is terrible if you have a SIM card the data you pay for isn't transferred. The phone only has G not 4G or even 3G it looks nice but that's it.,1
Phone is pretty good headphones are loud but the case doesn't protect it. Haven't activated it yet but its up to date and really nice size👍. The down side of it is that when u first turn it on it has a virus and porn but download a cleaning or security app to take it off🙌.,4
"its an ok phone. i like the size, but the camera quality is horrible and it is not 4g compatible like it says. it was extremely slow from the moment i opened it and it will not allow me to send text messages",1
When I received this it looked in good condition but once I tried to turn it in it didn't work even though I was charging... First time buying this and I don't recomand this item,1
Just got this today and the phone doesn't work. Like I went to charge it and guess what it just blink white screen every time doesn't show it charging and it won't turn on. I spent 80 dollar that I really don't have just to get my friend a gift for late Christmas gift. Now I am out 80 dollars and I can't do anything with it,1
This phone is no good. It looks nice but no good. I just got my phone and it keep turning off on me. I'm returning it . I'm piss though because can't get refund until after they get it back I need phone,1
This phone is very bad. I don't know how to send it back to amazon. First it can't get the connection every where. I use it with T-mobile but I am almost all time out of network connection. Second it is always turn off alone. I really hate this phone,1
I love how big the phone is but it totally sucks. It's 2g(not 3G) phone. It cuts on an off on you. Very disappointed in this phone. Would NOT recommend this to anyone.,2
I like the size of the screen but this phone is very slow especially when you are downloading a app it takes forever. when your going from one screen to back to home page it takes forever I don't know why....what doesn't it play videos it stops half way thru very very slow moving is there anything I can do to make it move faster and it freezes up,2
Over all the phone was very nice...My friends have Samsung and even they was impressed by this phone.However I took it to Metro and the phone would not recognize the system so I wasn't able to active it..,3
"One of the worst phones I have ever had. Apps shut down constantly and phone turns off by itself. Apps always say they need to be force closed. YouTube is very very slow, and shuts down randomly. One of the worst buys I have ever had.",1
Within a day I returned this phone back to Amazon. Nice screen but that's all. Poor internet service. Only allowed 2G network. Downloads were slow. This phone is good if you only plan to use it for Talk and text. Anything else it's a waste of money.,1
I have nothing bad to say.....my phone made it right on time.This is a very huge phone just what I wanted.... And also came with not one but two battery #winning,5
"Please you didn't do good at this time by sending me a different phone because the phone is not pad phone and moreover is not up to 6"" Inch as I saw before ordering it. No cover like the one I have from you before. I'm now afraid to order from you because you would not send what I request for. Have a good day",5
"GR8 PHONE!!!! All the benefits of a Samsung w.o the inflated price!! I love the screen size! Its bigger than the note 2/3 guys so it makes the viewing better, but harder to find really cool cases. All in all well worth the lack in accesories for the phone.",5
When making calls screen goes black and won't light back up when take away from face to hang up. Auto rotation does not work very well either. Phone isn't very fast and I know it's bot my internet connection I have experimented,3
Do not buy!!! It's a sturdy phone but it capabilities for connectivity is horrible I bought this because I tried to save 50 but I the end I ended up buying a Blu phone anyway u will not get any data on this phone just spend the extra 50 and get a Blu phone its amazing,1
Works great have an ATT Straight talk sim chip and works Great!!!! Just when and if you buy a case make sure you can try it with the phone! bought an note 2 case and phone is to big for it,5
"Totally horrible. The picture does NOT match the product. This picture shows a cute and up to date phone. The one I received was a generic, fake, and not a good one at that. If I'd had the option, I would have given zero stars.",1
Only rating it 5 stars so you can see this thing is junk! Don't waste your money the screen came all kind of messed up. Couldn't see anything on it!!!,5
Love it until the phone stop charging and no its not the battery or charger. Its the phone. Had to buy a whole new phone. Try to take it to repair shop they could not help me. It is better to purchase a whole new phone.,1
"Based on other peoples ratings I bought one, then I found it wasn't as they were positively recommending at all, It took about 48 hours to download just one app. You may try one if you think otherwise",1
"The phone is like a tablet, I love it. Takes good picture and video. For now, I have not seen any problems or have any issues with it. My friends likes it.",5
"Great service& great cell phone,yes to having speaker phone,I'll let you know about anything else,fun to have,got to take up space to end it on this,bye",5
I bought 2 of these phones for my wife and I and both of us love them every where i go i see people who have Galaxy S3 and 4 asking me where did I get that phone they all want to throw away their for mine love it.,5
HEY EVERYBODY! After much gnashing of teeth I found a WONDERFUL power supply from EBAY with a LONG PRONG that is PEFECT!! It isItem: 171730876692 on ebay.com,5
"So far everything is pretty awesome, my plan does not work with it so I have to go to a way more expensive carrier. I won't know until then just how well this phone serves me. The price was absolutely fabulous and the screen size really is what I was going for without having to pay up with my first born!",4
I have family mobile prepaid sim card and it worked right away the phone gets good signal and its works great.. The phone is not real fast but its fast enough and everything works fine.. For this price it is not bad at all.,4
I just got mine today and I gotta say its more than I expected....no glitches so far. Can't stop playing on it!Does anybody know what case I could buy to fit it?,5
i love the phone works very well. BUT now the pixals are messing up and i never drop the phone it does it very randomly also the ear peice is very low but other then that the phone is love,2
Some things were good about this phone but some things were not. When scrolling it would be blurry till you stopped. Hurt the eyes. Too many weird things would pop up too that was not on my phone.,1
The phone looks great but the charger went out my battery never stayes charged. The headphones it came with was poor quality the charger also because it went out/stopped working. The size of the phone is great,1
The phone ring volume is so low even on high and there are no case to fit phone pad wow wat a waist should have stayed with boost mobile never received charger to pad,3

No cover like the one I have from you before. I'm now afraid to order from you because you would not send what I request for. Have a good day",5
Everything was fine until three week ago I turn my phone on and it was totally wacked up I've had the phone only six months I will not buy another one will be sticking with American made only,2
"I am very disappointed. Unfortunate, already 2 days left when I could return it. Screen barely respond to touch, Battery is charging forever and dies very fast. Useless device.",1
Having a lot of problem with programming of this phone: currently unable to receive text messages. It appears there is no technical support center to assist with concerns.,2

"It's my first tablet (phablet) and it is little old, slow. But, I can always learn and find a use for it. Price was right. I haven't activated the phone yet, it's a GMS network phone and I'm still exploring providers. Somebody told me SEARS sold this make and model. It might be acting slow because the mobile data isn't activated yet. Happy.",4
Terrible because the headlines said that it was unlocked but when I received my shipment of the product to get it turned on it was locked so I'm sending it back,2
Like this because of the dual sim but I can't get rid of the apps that keep popping up in Chinese real annoying and it is very s?ow when surfing the web,2
"The phone I received was actually in better shape than described. When I took the phone in to switch it over, the associate was extremely impressed with what I paid, and said that the phone was new. Thank you for having such high standards. The phone is working perfectly, and I love it. What a deal!",5
"This phone is advertised as a US Cellular phone, however it's software had only been hacked and not compatible with their network nor could it be activated.",1
This phone was perfect. Took it to US Cellular and had no problem at all activating it. My son-in-law loves it. Even the US Cellular reps were impressed with the NEW condition and the price!! They also said BlackBerrys can be slow but this one seems very fast.,5
"I disliked this phone so much as to purchase a Samsung unit. It would turn off the radio function by itself, I missed many calls as the ringer might or might not work. The only thing I could get on the web was the weather channel.",1
I'm very pleased with this phone.I haven't had any issues with it since I've had it.delivery was good it got here before the estimated date which is good.its alittle slow but that's all. Overall its a good phone at least for me.,5
"The phones were advertised as being ""Windows 10 Ready"", this couldn't be farther from the truth. The minute we tried to download Windows 10 we received an error message saying that it was not possible to do on that phone. We promptly sent them back.",1
This phone settings were in a different language I thinkwas like Chinese; however after playing with it I found the tools in the settings and I was able to change it to English. the phone seems very nice and it's a really good phone for the price. It is good to mentioned it only took me about 10 minutes to be able to change it to English.,4
"BUY A CASE, BUY A CASE BUY A CASE! every revier and unboxing I saw when this phone came out showed one included - WRONG. The phone is awesome but more slippery than a fish. Had is less than a week and both sides cracked while in my FSfjxrhdyxING pocket.........",4
Easily the best phone I've ever used. Great price point but even better performance and image quality of the screen and sound quality from speakers. Will stick with this phone for a while unless Alcatel can somehow find a way to out do the Idol 4s.,5
"Coming from an Asus Zenfone 2, this smartphone charges super fast. The screen is super crisp vibrant colors and with a VR, JBL headphones and a faux tempered screen protector can't go wrong with the package on this phone.",5
This device is fire '. It's nice from its nice battery life to its camera. Its VR goggles is OK nothing that will blow you a way. Its worth its price from screen to design.,5

"My teenage son was very excited about getting this phone only to be disappointed after only a couple months of having it. The screen blanks out on occasion, the battery is already dying despite him charging it properly, and he sadly still likes my droid turbo better because it can do more. Otherwise, he loves having his own phone.",2
"The Alcatel phone is nice but they are cheaply made, that's why they are so inexpensive. The prongs inside the phone where you plug in the charging cable are cheaply made and tend to bend and break. The volume on the phone leaves a lot to be desired. The phone lasted about 6 months.",2
"Great phone for the price! Fast shipping, and worked wonderfully out of the box. You can't beat this phone for what it costs- does everything a high end phone does and is a nice size screen.",5
"I give it a 4 star rating only because of the issue with the microphone and not seeing the 4G icon when in a 4G Network... Other than that, it's an awesome upgrade from the Alcatel One Touch Fierce.",4
Put in a Tmobile chip and only the phone worked no data. Since it was a metro pcs phone I went there and they couldn't activate it.. and they have the phone for $29.00... so it went in my pile of junk,1
"Excellent, the phone work very well ,. i live in Santo Domingo and i'm very happy with this buy , it's true the phone is FACTORY UNLOCKED - WORKS WITH ANY SIM CARDS",5
The Alcatel Fierce 2 is nice phone since I am using this phone for more that an year. Sound quality is pretty good also the hands free speaker. Sensitivity of the touch screen also very good. 4GB memory is good enough to multitask and installing many apps if needed. The only think I didn't like is the thickness of the phone.,4
"Ok 4 the price but if you're used to better phones like LG, Samsung, or HTC it's gonna be crappy.But it works and doesn't lag or anything. And isn't to shabby on speed either. Camera is garbage. Audio playback is actually good. Screen nice n clear.",3
Does not ring already and the speaker stopped working! And my pictures just keep being deleted. I can no longer send pictures in a text. All of my contacts are gone. It is junk! Don't buy it!,1
"Why cant my t mobile sim card fit inside the sim slot. It says this phone is also inside a t mobile phone but that was a lie or maybe there are different types of t mobile sim cards, i don't know, but mines do not fit.",1
"Restarts or shuts down on it's own several time a day. Takes about 5 minutes to start up after this. Can freeze and restart while doing something. Google maps never worked for more than 5 minutes before closing. Doesn't deserve even a single star. Total waste of money, plain junk.",1
Phone was not unlocked when I received it even though it was advertised as unlocked. Phone did not work so I also had to have it repaired. . Bad choice by me to buy this phone from this vendor.,1
I liked the phone but I phone signal disappointed because I expected to have a signal 4g in Venezuela because several friends have the same cell and if the signal rises 4g but not mine. the seller treated me well and I sent the code to unlock the phone,5

"Exceptional phone for the price. Lightweight, thin, bright screen. loud and clear speakers front speakers. Process is reasonably responsive. Works with your Google voice number, unlike Asus Zenfone 2.",5
Extremely poor hardware which explains the low price. Its been 4 months and I already have a problem with the charging port. It's a struggle to get the phone to charge.,2
Will definitely recommend for purchasing this product..got mine brand new and I'm extremely happy thanks again.. Delivery was fast too got it within 4 days of purchase,4
Odd feel. The basic reason for a phone is to talk right? This is the worst flaw in the phone. I had a hard time answering and placing phone calls. The phone seems to have a long pause at the oddest times. I am glad after one month this phone was ruined by water. I would hate to put up with this phone for 2 years.,3
"Best deal on an android phone, fast responsive, stereo front speakers sound great and battery life is very good, overall look and feel of this phone excellent. Screen is sharp with good color tones.",4
"This would have been a great phone, except it keeps loosing network connectivity randomly (especially during phone calls) and I often have to speak very loudly in order to have the person on the other end of the call hear what I'm saying.All in all, a big disappointment.",1
Best versatile phone out there. Has a lot of upgraded features from it's past generations but the idol 3 has came along way in a view of a flagship inexpensive phone. I love the phone and how it is gsm unlocked. Well done Alcatel. I'm curious if Alcatel is going to come out with a new generation of one touch.,5
This device was really enjoyed to use and everything about it was pretty good if I had any gripe it would have to be the bubbly icon but that's just nitpicking. For more information on this device please search for Eric Drummond on YouTube,5
"The phone is awesome for the price so worth it. It's perfect hand size but the 5.5"" screen would be nicer, but for the extra $70- 80 or w.e. the difference is. It was out of my personal budget",5
The phone came without issues. Have a great display and the processor responds well. Visually have a great look. For the price is a very good acquisition.,5
"This phone is marred by unacceptable Bluetooth performance. It literally drops my Bluetooth headset when I put it in my pants pocket! On the plus side, the sound and speaker phone functionality is quite good, as other reviewers have mentioned. It also is not an exceptionally rugged phone as the screen broke after a fall from less than 3 feet.",3
"Very happy with this phone. My last one was also an Alcatel but only 4 gig, not near enough for all the popular software and photographs. 16 gig seems really good for my needs. Would buy again!",5
"The call quality is terrible, something between fade and tin can. Camera is ok, but image quality well below my previous phones, a Moto G and an LG. Most frustrating of all, after a month, the first time I dropped the phone the screen shattered and that was with an outer casing accessory. The only redeeming quality was the compact size.",2
Great phone and much more dependable than other phones in its price range. Great pics and easy to use. The only con is battery life. If you use location services and bluetooth then you must charge everyday. Other than that I love the phone.,4
"The phone came in its original box with a security seal, not only did it come with a good charger(the one that you can plug into a computer or wall) but it also came with JBL headphones.Also, product came in 2 days.I cant believe I got all this with such good quality for such a good price.Definitely a good buy.",5
Pretty solid battery life. Fast. BIG sound. Just wish the camera had a little more zoom and the screen is only about 4in max. But the camera is quite clear and good hd screen,4
I really like the size and weight of this phone. A friend has a Samsung Galaxy S6 and we both think it's too bulky. Personal preference...It's nice to have a micro SD to load up with photos and music. Music player is fun to mess with. If I could change one thing it would be dual SIM.Works great with US-Mobile. No complaints.,4
"Got it as a gift for my dad in India, replaced his Micromax phone. Dad is super delighted. Superb performance, very good photography, long battery life, super slim. Android is not overly skinned but practical and lightweight.BTW, the next generation of this phone (Idol 4) is the Blackberry Android phone. Strong cred there!",5
"The phone looks nice and works smoothly. Definitely worth the price. The cameras, both front and back, take crisp clear pictures. Very happy with the product.",5
I brought this phone for my son for Christmas and he loves it. We are with T-Mobile. He switched his SIM card from his old phone to this phone and hasn't had any problems at all.,5
"I bought 2 UNITS OF THIS CELL PHONE, HO HAVE DEPRECIATION OF $ 20 EACH, I feel ripped off, RETURN MY MONEY, NOT SEE POSSIBLE IN PROMOTION THIS SAME IN $ 169 NOW $ 149 PAGE MORE FOR THE SAME PHONE LESS ONE WEEK, RETURNING THIS DIFFERENCE IN A BONO GIFTCARD",1
"at first 4 days, phone feels solid but will not recognized new external 16GB extermal micro SD card. i tried reboot, formating card, and re-installing SD Card but nothing. when i go to settings, storage..it says mount SD card, when i click ....nothing. frustrating as this is why i dumped my old LG optimus F6.",3
"Awesome phone. Light on apps, upgraded to newest Android, and is fast with apps, tethering, and everything in between. One of the best unlocked phones out there. Also, audio quality and included JBL earbuds sound great, and the camera and flexibility of this phone is amazing. Would recommend and buy again.",5
"excellent product, received in perfect condition and the phone is very good, very sophisticated and very responsive. Its main feature is that the sound is very good and meets the expectation of a person who is not so demanding, and the owner of the publication are very responsible recommend them.",5
"A great phone for the price. There are a few bugs, but minor ones and I think every phone has those. The camera is powerful, the interface is smooth and offers some cool and unusual features, and it's just the right size. I'd recommend it.",5
"I love this phone! Great camera, great storage, great screen, great speakers. The only thing is, it has trouble getting service. A lot of dead zones with this phone, my boyfriend has the same service provider and usually has a signal while I don't.",5
"It slipped off my lap while I was sitting in a chair, falling 1.5 feet to the ground and the screen exploded. Yeah it's my fault because I ""dropped"" it. But how many phones have I had in my life that i've dropped from much higher distances, and that has never happened.:(",2
The phone is very nice. I bought it for the stereo speakers built-in and they don't disappoint. The speakers are loud. The screen is clear and can show good videos. The size is just right in my hand. The inverting screen is a great feature to use.,5
Very nice phone. It is a simple phone but it work good. Maybe the camera not perfect but for the price it is a worthy phone.I am from the caribbean and the phone work ok. It is indeed unlocked.,4
Love it. Definitely worth the great price. I have owed mine for over six months and love it. Second Alcatel phone I have owed only bought new one because I was ready to upgrade. Love these phones. price is wonderful.,5
"Phone has been great. Only smaller phone on the market at the time of purchase (couple months). Specs are fantastic for the price. OS is liveable.. Previous phone was a nexus 5. Hope its good for the next couple years... If not, I'm not out much money. Win win. Quality product.",5
Great unlocked phone that doesnt come with an insane amount of bloatware and works with AT&T. The camera is average and takes decent pictures with adequate sunlight but suffers in indoor lowlight.,5
"It's ambidextrous gimmick sometimes screws up your phone call. People say I sound distant, which could mean that the mic and speaker don't switch as fast as the rest of the phone.The phone also shuts down at random or when charging in a car or mobile battery.Still pretty solid for the price though.",3
"The last phone I had worked perfectly but I dropped it in some water and needed to get a new one. The new one I got keeps restarting every time it drops on a hard surface. Might be a battery problem, not sure. Anyway not bad for the cost.",3
"I have only had Alcatel as a smartphone . This is my second one. Does functions I need,Google search. Phone ,gps,e mail.wish gps aa little sooner with driving directions but much easier to use than car navigator",4
"A decent mid range phone..Does everything I need it to do..Taste varies per person..Marshmallow OS is great, the sound is AWESOME!.A little slow in some areas, but not a BIG deal breaker..For the price DEFINITELY worth looking into ..",4
For the money this phone has some nice features the top brands do not have. Loudspeaker phone. Reversible UI and a nice vivid display. For me it was too big.,5
"This was a gift for my brother. He absolutely love it. It has a perfect fit for a man's pocket and great speakers. The only con I can mention for now is the battery life. One of its great features is the design, seems like a more expensive cell phone.",4
"Replaced my Galaxy S5 with the idol 3 4.7 and could not be happier! Snappy fast, clear display,basically stock android so none of that Samsung bloat ware you can't remove. The size fits in your pocket and easy to operate with one hand. Battery last me all day with solid use. Love this phone, it was a great purchase!",5
"It's been 6 months after I bought this product. Internal storage is 12gb only and the phone stop vibrating a month ago. I'm thinking of getting a warranty.Other than that, the design is sleek and beautiful.",3
"Nice, solid Android smartphone. I wear my phone on my belt and wanted to keep the smaller footprint. The display is really good, the speakers are great. I am very satisfied and it doesn't add $25 to $30 to my phone bill like buying phones on AT&T's new plan.",5
"I want to love this phone but:1. it won't record phone calls with Android 6.01, I heard this is a deliberated HW setting from the manufacture. This is a shame.2. The screen auto dim doesn't work. Seriously, such basic feature!",1
"My first smart phone and am very satisfied. I did not want a large phone and this was the perfect size. Also could not justify paying more than a couple hundred for a ""phone"". Love it. Has just enough features that I would use. Bought one for my sister also and we both agree it has enough of what we need.",5
"Good phone but the seller misled in its add. Yes , it unlocked , international but it only had 5 language. I mean it as a gift for someone who doesn't know English, French, Spanish or German. I needed Russian but it was not there!!! So make sure you are getting a phone with a language options for setting commands /tools that you'd actually know",2
"This phone is amazing! I love it so much! It is the best phone I have had so far. It comes with some apps already( clock, calendar, etc.). Overall it is a great phone for a great price!",5
"Bought this for my wife and she loves it! No more deleting files and apps every weekend, plenty of storage space. Convenient size and very responsive. Great phone for this price!",5
"This is a great budget Android phone! Perfect size and weight at 4.7"" and 3.88 oz. Takes an SD card for expandable storage.Great speakers for a small phone! Excellent display.Can't beat it for the price!",5
"The pro is it's a good solid case that protects my phone. The con is with the case on, it's hard to turn on and off, you have to really mash the button on the case (which is a pain).",4
"It freezes sometimes, and when you make a call, the ringtone gets very low. And when you put it on gesture, the screen doesn't respond to tapping it consistently.",3
"It's a nice piece of tech. Only thing I'm looking to change is the way it fades from on song to another, the overlap can ruin the end of a song. I bet there's a way to stop it and I just have to keep playing with the phone to find how.",5
"I admit I was skeptical at first with an off-name brand I'd never heard of. But this phone rocks! Fast. No glitches. Great speakers. Expandable memory. Only drawbacks are it's not as bright as my old Samsung or camera quite as sharp, but they're more than good enough. I'd buy it again. Nuf said.",5
"The phone looks nice and works smoothly. Definitely worth the price. The cameras, both front and back, take crisp clear pictures. Very happy with the product.",5

It's a good for the price tag. I really liked the battery life and all other aspect. The screen design makes it difficult to recommend this phone. Thin phone + 5.5 display is prone to CRACK!!! My idol3 screen cracked in regular usage and I'm no longer able to use the phone.,3
"Horrible phone. It will look good for the first 3 months but then it comes up, dead pixels, broken audio, flimsy casing, etc. If you want to get a cheap good smart phone, get an older galaxy or iPhone... Horrible phone made to be good",1
Speakers are great on this thing best speakers I heard in a cell phone. Camera looks great also has very good photos. No lagging that I can notice got in on the preorder price of $200 so its a steal for this unlocked phone. I never heard of Alcatel before and I absolutely love it.,5
"Bought the phone for my daughter who is a teenager now. Nice phone and for this price, you don't need to worry about it too much.The phone itself is petty solid, and the performance is great.",5
I love this phone but this phone started crashing on me here and there often but if alcatel can fix this again I would to purchase this again if there nothing happens like this again,4
"Arrived two days early. Great buy so far, still need to take photos. Good battery life on SB. No option to turn off swipe to open. Needs slim case, very slippery.",4
so far so good .had a problem with the screen going off when during a phone call..so i couldn't hang up...turned out the proximity sensor had dust in it and needed blown out(earphone jack) and if you open too many apps then try to music from the sd card it will studder..but all in all works for the most part.,5
Bought it as a gift from a relative. He loves its there is direct feedback from him1. Light Weight2. Fit well in the pocket3. Batter last really well.,5
"haven't ever experienced terrible phone like this.it does not touch well. I have to click more than one time.one day i found that all the app data gone. I had to log in all the apps, and change the settings in each app.it works slow just like snapdragon 400 series",1
I have had this phone for almost a week. Not one problem. Other than a few lags here and there. A great phone for a unheard of price. I paid $150 for this phone and it runs and feels like a $800 flagship phone. Only down side is I wish it had 4 Gigabyte's of RAM and not the 2 Gigabyte's.,5
Phone suffered a screen crack riding in my pocket for 5 minutes while driving 2 months after being purchased. Not very durable. I would not buy it again.,1
"Its been more then 6 months i am using this mobile . i liked it. Perfect size , for watching video on go and reading books. Awesome sound quality by the way i love JBL sound mixer app Camera quality is really good Battery Life is good and charge pretty fast with its own charger. All in all i like this mobile",5
"The Idol 3 smartphone is so thin and light that, despite its large 4.7"" diagonal screen, it doesn't feel any bulkier in my bluejeans pocket than my 5-year-old prior smartphone did, Great job.",5
Horribleeee experience with this cell phone... i bought the first one through amazon and it came used (i ordered a new one). then i tried ordering it through alcatel webpage and it came defective!! the color in the screens were all wrong. horrible brand.,1
"Nice smartphone for reasonable price. Not the best performance but the dual JBL speakers are really loud and phone has a nice design.I have been using it for 2 months and one of my family member likes it so much, I ended up buying a second one for them.",5
"Phone cracks very easily, after first crack the bottom half stopped working. The first 4 days I had it the speakers didnt work so I had to factory reset it. Other than those problems, I really like the phone. Gets what I need done and the camera was great when I could use it.",2
"Incredible phone for the price. It has many features that no other phone has at this price point,NFC,good JBL stereo speakers and earbuds.It has a nice display 1080 p and it upgraded to Marshmallow 6.0 right away. An awesome phone for a great price. The best low price phone that I know of.",5
"What can you say, it is made in China and that means GOOD REAL GOOD to me.I have several others and they are all excellent.I travel to China on vacation and I use a China Mobile Simm, no problems. GREAT PHONE.Uses AT&T and is really 4G LTE and it works great and in China is also excellent!!!!!!!",5
Got this to replace my Galaxy S3 and I couldn't have found a better phone on my budget! Its way faster than the previous and it has an updated software! Its a gorgeous phone and worth the wait!,5
Do not buy this phone unless you want a phone that last 3 months the glue they used to attach the screen has weared off in 3 months so the screen is litlery pealing off my phone at this moment do not buy,1
Bought it as a gift. It was good for i wanna say 7 months maybe and now the problems never end. The power button got stuck somehow and you cant use it and you cant screenshot. It wore out very fast the battery life shortens very quickly. Being how many good reviews i saw for it both me and my significant other ( who has the phone ) were let down.,2
"This phone is awesome!! The display is bright and clear, the sound is fantastic. Internet connection also great. I use straight talk and have no problems. Buy this phone.",5
"Is an acceptable phone considering it costs about 140 dollarsOctacoreNice speakers (JBL)Acceptable screen.Android 6I havethis phone about a month, and restart only once. I don't know what will happen in the future, but is enough phone for me.",4
This phone failed 34 days after my order. I have no recourse to return based on the 30 day policy. There is not even a clear ability to communicate to Amazon about this.This is an unfortunate customer service issueWould not purchase again,1
I have had this phone close to a month now I am beyond impressed. I will never buy a $400-700 phone again as long as this company is making quality phones for a reasonable price.,5
The phone has everything I need at an irresistible price !! The signal is very strong when I'm in places that did not have any sign ... Camera is decent...sound incredible !! I do not play with cell so the battery lasts me two days !! The connectivities WiFi and all are very good !!,5
"This Smartphone has met My expectations and then some. It is extremely fast and does what it says, this was a upgrade from My last Alcatel, it was well worth the money when considering other high end Smartphones. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who wants to upgrade without the big price tag. 5 Stars To Alcatel.!!!",5
This phone sounds great and feels great. I wish the text messaging app was better and I don't like the placement of the power button. Those are small issues that I can deal with. The best phone around for $249.,4
"This phone so far has been a good mix between value, design and performance. I can only hope that Alcatel continues building a budget/ performance friendly phone for the Android OS.",4
"VERY IMPRESSIVE PHONE, AND THE BIGGER SCREEN AND 1080 DISPLAY IS VERY GOOD. PROBABLY THE BEST SOUNDING PHONE IVE EVER HEARD WITH ITS JBL SPEAKER SYSTEM.",5
My son asked me to order this particular phone for him. He is very happy with it. He had done researches on phone before deciding on this one. He is thrilled that the phone is exactly what he expected.,5
"The speakers are great.2 bad sides are that the screen is humped over the speakers so the screen would get scratched easily. The second is that when switching from earpiece to speakerphone, there is a 10 second blank delay where you can't hear the other person, but they can hear you.",4
"Great phone! Great battery! Highly recommend. Don't buy cheap Chinese brands. I bought 2 chinese brands from amazon and one lasted one year, the other only a few months. Buy the Alcatel.",5
"Very happy with the Alcatel Idol, it meets all my needs. It's a very SMART phone. The only downside is a non replaceable battery. By the time it would need a new battery, it's time to upgrade the phone.",4
"Hi.The description of the product say: Is global unlocked and can use in 4LTE but it doesnt work, If you can help me I'll really appreciate that.Anything else is ok.ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",3
This item was damaged really bad I ended up having to pay for repairs...this wasn't a good buy on my end....in case your wondering the screen fell off the device.,1
The screen is very good and so are the speakers. The battery life is good as well. The phones weakest points are build quality and performance. It became frustrafing to use. The phone itself looks great but the speaker and screen had some movement. It seemed separated.,3
Excellent value for your dollar and works on AT&T and T-Mobile networks at LTE speeds. Speakers are loud without distortion and screen is bright and clear with good viewing angles.,5
"I was very lucky I have this Android phone! Its cheap but, it has competetive performance compare to the high end android phone. I did not have a second thought to buy this gadget!",4
"I have T-Mobile and it works fantastically. I bought it because I needed a bigger screen (had the Moto G, another great phone) but the screen was too small. Great phone all around.",4
"Love this phone! I'm not a tech person, but I can absolutely appreciate the value I am getting from this $250 phone. If you don't care about all the speed ratings etc. , which for everyday typical phone use shouldn't make a difference, then I highly recommend checking out this phone.",5
I bought this phone for my wife as a replacement for her old one. We both loved it ! It make me wish that I had ordered it for myself. It is a beautiful phone with great features at an incredible price. I am very pleased with this purchase.,5
I would not recommend this phone because it is NOT supported by the manufacturer. There is no support for this phone whatsoever. It's biggest problem is software and there isn't even a FAQ blog to go to. DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!,1
Although the cameras are not the best in the world I cannot be too angry for $250!The screen is super bright and the speakers are front facing and better than my iPhone!Unfortunately the battery will not last you all day in heavy use but again for the price it cannot be beat!,5
The phone is alright but the new update have it kind of buggy and I don't like how they put the charger at the bottom. Also the front facing speakers or up to par when watching videos.,4
"I surprised my girlfriend with this phone for Christmas and she loves it. The wasome thing about is,there is very little that this phone won't do. Definitely worth the price and then some. The resolution isn't half bad at all and the interface is very clean and bear stock Android.",4
The processor is SUPER SLOW .. the battery life SUCKS .. on a full charge overnight not even 2 hours and it's already near 70% lags a lot and it just annoys me a lot because of how slow and unresponsive it can get. I wouldn't recommend anyone getting this phone if they don't like waiting for their phone to just open a simple messenger app.,1
"Phone stopped working and won't turn on in less than one year, vendor (Good guys) say their warranty is only 90 days, now trying to deal directly with Alcatel. This is what you get for not buying reputable brands like Samsung, Apple, etc... Will never buy Alcatel again.",2
"Awesome!! I haven't had any problems with it. Nice screen and speakers. The camera is great for the price, good colors and all of that. Only one thing it does get a little warm but cools fast",5
"Crashes and reboots frequently. In Whatsapp, it hangs when viewing an image... slow. Screen already has a break without dropping it, and it has a rubber protector. Worst, a hairline break on the screen has made the keyboard useless, can't return phone... it's dead in only 35 days...I made a mistake buying it...",1
"Nice phone for what I paid (99). I'd much rather pay this price whenever my phone breaks then paying 600-800 for another phone!Overall good buy. Works well, has nice features.",5
Guys excellent phone than moto g play all with jbl speakers and headphones just buy first and than see the magic good budgeted phone just for 99 dollars,5
Great phone. I Upgraded from the Moto G LTE which was $220. The difference is night and day in terms if performance. Everything opens super quick and it almost never lags. The camera is great so far (especially the manual mode). Cheap phones are getting better and better each year. Battery life is great as well.,5
"Stay away from Alcatel products. They do not do updates but when they do it us not for your benefit. The only real update was forced onto the idol 3 phone and it removed band 12 from the phone. This is a BIG deal if you use TMobile. Alcatel advertised it band 12 capable, it is now not.",1
"Simply the BEST budget smartphone out there now even better then the Motorola Moto G! This phone is packed with features like tap to wake, Android 5.0.2 a reversible hand set the can be used even upside down and has 4G LTE for all Gsm carries such as T-Mobile and AT&T.. So what are you waiting for a must buy smartphone for 2015!",5
"if u have no ther option, then u better stay with no phone. Days 1 thru 3 were good. Then everything went downhill. The phone lags, it stutters, it freezes to the point where it begins to get hot and it locks up. The phone did feel ok in the hand. oh yeah and the speakers were good.",1
"Can't beat this phone for the price! I replaced my Samsung Galaxy S5 and haven't looked back.My only complaint is the lack of removable battery, but luckily that hasn't been an issue yet.",5
"Beautiful well performing android. Processor is quick, takes decent pictures, and display is very nice. However, the home button stopped working after 11 months of use. Now, cannot let the phone go into sleep mode or let the battery die because it won't come back on.",3
"A very cool design, awsome layout, and good quality for a really fair price. The only problem with the phone that I've had is with putting in the SD card and SIMs card in and phone will reboot itself sometimes but all is good for how much it is",5
Pleasing device. Smooth transition from Galaxy Note 3. Too easily snap screen shots due to my clumsy grip. Great reception. Sharp screen. Recommend second to Galaxy family of phones.,5
I'll never buy a ridiculously expensive phone again! Hopefully they keep producing this quality at a reasonable price. I'm just an average daily user and I've found no fault at all with this device.,5
"I have had other phones (Moto G 1st and 2nd generation, Moto E) but the Alcatel OneTouch Idol 3 is by far the best one that I have used. I enjoy using this phone, compared to the others that I have owned. I would recommend this phone to anyone.",5
"The only drawback is that the Alcatel phone that claims to have 16 GB of internal storage, when I check the drive settings - storage, I find myself having only 10.95 GB of internal storage , in other words it was not 100% described the product sales , I get discouraged a little.",3
Gets really hot when charging it. After a few android updates runs extremely slow. Very glitchy. The only thing good about this phone is the speakers. I would pass on this phone. Has a hard time multi tasking. Should have got the zenfone 2.,2
"Awesome phone! I am ecExtremely pleased with my purchase if it and so glad I did some research and feel like I bought the best possible phone for the money spent. Very sturdy, actually comes with an instruction book and great headphones. So much better than ibuds! This is my first android phone and so not have any regrets! Highly recommend! I",5
"Liked the phone. Screen and speakers were phenomenal. The performance for me was unacceptable the browser always bogged down and would freeze mid scroll, and the Bluetooth was horrendous. It would connect to my car then disconnect, so I've returned.",3
"Love the phone. Great camera, memory, screen, etc. Only complaint is that text notifications seem to be inconsistent. Completely a SW issue though, is recommend this phone to anyone.",4
"It's nice that this phone has LTE and it functions okay. I installed a different launcher because the one that came stock was not that great. My bottom volume button stopped functioning after a few weeks, which was a bummer, but with the reversible function, I can just rotate it and get my bottom volume button to work.",3
"It scratches easy, the screen protector they sent doesn't work properly... it fell today now the digitizer is gone....it over heats with the battery....worst luck ever with phones",2
"My siblings, coworkers, and even my friends wants to buy this phone from me as soon as I unbox it and setting up the phone. I love how big it is, the system runs smooth and its everything it says on the description. I love the phone and fits my style for a great price. :)",5
A really great phone. Only the headphones don't work on the phone. Works on other phones. But not on this phone. My Bose works on this my Sony works on this phone but not the one included. Yet the included headphone works on my iPhone 6. ????? Go figure.Over all a great phone hit the price.,4
"Excellent battery life that lasts a day of hard usage, survived a 4 foot drop onto a wood floor, very good audio, and a mostly lag free experience.The only flaw would be the lack of Wi Fi calling with T mobile",4
Very good product! An improvement over my 2 year old moto g no doubt. My one and only issue so far is that sometimes it doesn't respond right away opening an app,4
"Shipping pretty fast . They left it by my garage, not on my front door or mailbox , which confused me on where it was when I received the notification saying it was on my porch . But overall , it's in perfect shape and it works amazingly . Thank you",5
"I love this phone! By the way, if you are looking for other cases for it I be using the blue vivo xl cases. It fit but the headphone Jack is a little off. Also, the buttons on the sides is off to but you can set this phone to turn on and off by tapping the screen( Which is a plus). But that's just what I use. The phone is love!",5
"Have only had this phone for sub two weeks and have had nothing but issues out of the box. Constant freezing and crashing, i cant even use certain apps, my photos don't load and the phone straight up goes black screen and restarts at least once a day. Very unhappy customer at this point in time.",1
I've had this phone for 3.5 months now and am thoroughly disappointed with it. It doesn't multitask very well. Freezes up at the most inopportune times. And has begun restarting itself randomly throughout the day! Save your money!!!!,1
"Love the phone. Had a iPhone 4 and galaxy s3. This Alcatel is better in every way. Battery, speakers, flip screen. Etc. If I ever need I'll be buying Alcatel again.",5
"This is the second ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3. Set it up and shut it off and you'll not be able to use the device again! Going the Wallmart tomorrow and if the Sim Card does'nt fix it, it's going back the amazon! One star because no lower option.",1
Great phone. Mom loves it as a replacement for her Moto G. Love the stock version of Android -- it's super fast and smooth and the screen is perfect in quality and size for her.,5
"This is a great phone. I'm not sure why they call this a mid range phone when the specs are the same/if better than the Galaxy line, M8 from HTC, etc.",5
Possibly the best all around budget smartphone. I love this phone but its removable battery and large body size isnt for everyone. I like this phone for everything it has.,5
"Screen capture button is horrible, same button as power on. Screen brightness is another issue. Hard to take pics while outdoors in sun shine. Good batteries, great camera, fast processor,awesome speakers for music...",3
"This is a really nice Android smartphone. There is a software update that brings Android 6.0.1. It's not a gaming smartphone, but for a day basics stuff it's perfect.The only downside is the lack of system languages. I live in America, I talk english, but will be nice to use the device in my native language.",4
I am very happy with this new phone to'm fine now good only bad thing that the battery can not be changed but I'm happy with my new idol acatel 3 graces.,5
"Alcatel is slow on up dates, it appears they will not update to 5.1, setting the stage for a dead end phone. Does not support wifi calling. They have gone out of their way of preventing rooting, u can root, then your out of luck if u want to revert. They mess with partition lock. Okay phone, other then alcatel's anal approach to prevent custom o.s",2
"Excellent phone for the price. I went to this from the LG Nexus 5, and I'm pretty sure the Idol 3 outperforms it on every level. Very satisfied with this phone.",5
"Great quality, great sound, and pure android Lollipop experience. I love the design and runs smother than my Samsung Galaxy S5, at half the price. Recommend to all android users if they want a great product.",5
I've had this phone for five days. I love it! The screen is crisp and clear. The sound is unbelievable! It's very thin and easy to manage. You can't go wrong buying this amazing phone. Hubby convinced me to choose this one and I'm glad he did!,5
"Amazing phone thats lightweight, thin, comfortable, and has a beautiful display, loud front facing speakers, fast processor, and nice premium desing. It foes get a little hot, but if you throw a case on it its fine. Also, the packaging is really nice. The included jbl headphones are really good",5
"The big screen is nice, but the phone itself is so slow and sometimes shuts itself down which is really annoying. I also hate that the button to turn the screen on is on the left and the volume on the right. It's backwards from every other phone I've ever had.",2
"Outstanding phone love the speed, screen, and speakers. Thin light big screen but I can still use it one handed.Screen is better than my last phone a high end Nokia with oled. Calls clear, haptic feedback on screen taps makes typing a breeze. EQ on speakers and headphones.",5
"Piece of crap, broke within 3 months with minimal ware. Customer service is terrible and no parts are available for the device.I wasted 200 bucks and i'm never buying anything from Alcatel again.",1
"The best audio, the most vivid colors, fast enough, altough average camera (i didn't expect much about this last point because of the comments i read before i bought it).",5
"Originally I gave this phone a stellar review. However, this phone is a case of you get what you pay for. It stopped charging at 5 week. I just missed the amazon return policy window.",1
Faster than a Nexus 5. Great screen. Excellent battery life. Attractive (unbranded) front face. Overall I'm blown away by this device primarly because of it's price point. There's no reason to pay $600+ for a smartphone these days.,5
It's a good phone but if you use it to browse the web a lot it's lack of memory hurts the experience... Scrolling webpages become a unpleasant experience... Hopefully the next version will have more memory wich would fix this issue.,3
"I adquiro this cell at a good price, and I only have a few days with him, so far I 'm surprised with all epesifiaciones and options , general .. rapidez..Todo cell is adata you. It is good team and if cuidas- best that price ..",5
"My first smart phone. It will take me a while to use all its capacity. I just heard about an app that is a magnifier, which I really need. Asking ""Okay Google"" has replaced Wikipedia as my new helpmate. Great price too.",5
"Honestly will never buy a NAME brand phone again. My wife and I go through phones. You know the $600+ ones about every 6 months. This phone is faster than my LG G4, my Galaxy s6, and her Galaxy Note 4. Just plain and simple phone that does everything well.",5
"To start off the is a decent phone for its generation, clear screen and feels good in hand nice weight.Unfortunately the sim card stop registering and google play didn't open. Phone work for about a week.The sim card was fine we placed it into a different phone worked properly. In all its old and slow but looks and feels nice.",2
"Great performance, never run into any lagging. Nice and thin and fits well in my pocket (I was used to a 4"" phone!). Great screen and battery life. Dropped one star because the camera isn't all that great, particularly in low light.",4
Loved everything about the phone except the camera which totally sucked if you didn't have the perfect lighting situation. If having a good camera isn't important to you then it's a good phone.,2
A great phone for the money. If you don't have to have the latest and greatest then check this phone out. Only missing 3gb(it has 2) ram as compared to other top flight phones.,5
"This device works with mexican phone carriers, i bought this and the speakers sounds very loud does not need any from an iphone, samsung any other brands",5
Its an excellent phone. much better than I expected. Great screen.Good baytery life.Audio quality through headphones and speakers are good. My only problem is with the sensitivity of the screen; its not reliable. Overall great phone for the price,4
"- It has a good design, is very light, thin and symmetrical, which also used to use one of its most striking features, reversibility: does not matter as lame, the screen rotates for use in the right direction, even to take calls . That also has duplicates",5
"I've been very pleasantly surprised by this phone. My last phone was a Samsung Galaxy S3 and so far this just blows that out of the water. Great, front-facing speakers (for a phone, at least), solid connectivity and web browsing experience, nice sleak design, impressive battery life. It has everything I need in a phone for the right price.",5
"Great build quality, minimal bloat ware, great sounding speakers, pretty ok call quality, looks good. I'm really a Windows Phone guy but thought I'd try Android for fun. Not to bad. I have however loaded it up with WP features and launchers. Got for $99.99 lucky me well worth it.",4
yes but I wish it was a 2k or 4k screen and the speakers was a little louder but other than that I love the phone for the price $249can't beat that or less it was $199but is OK,4
"Far better than my Galaxy s4 or note 2, much better battery and faster than eitherI have a lot of apps, and it is not laggy at all, but I use Nova launcher which is greatThe only negative is that the double tap function often does not work. I don't know if this is a phone issue or Android or Novalauncher.",5
Ok was very disappointed when I got y phone and turned it on it asked me to do an update I did and I couldn't do anything with it after all I had was a black screen so I had to do a hard reset and NOT DO THE UPDATE...now I'm very happy with my phone for now ....I just got it yesterday.update I LOVE THIS PHONE,5
This phone is great for the price. Has all of the state of the art features that other high grade smart phones have. Love the slim design. Better that buying a phone through ATT Next and being stuck for $15 -25/month for 30 months.,5
"It is a great phone that exceeded my expectations. The stock camera app cannot lock the focus under indoor lighting. But I solved the problem by downloading a free app ""A Better Camera"". An added bonus, I now have descent cellular signal that my previous 3 phones couldn't get in my office. Very satisfied so far.",5
"A 4! Because of the sim tray, don't like the back to back design, cards did and could get stuck, got to be very careful!! outside of that this device rocks! Thanks",4
"I Like it alot. Good loud speakers and great looking screen, quick and snappy on apps. It does have some bloatware but can get it out easily enough. I just wished this model had an otterbox defender or something as strong.",5
Came in two days. We ordered it for our younger cousin. So far so good. We may update once she gets it turned on and going. But you shouldn't get much complaint from a 16 yr old. lol,5
It only gets 1 star bc it kept shutting itself off. It would freeze then shut off in the middle of me doing something. Or I could b across the RM and my phone would shut off. Not sure if I just got a bad one or not but I couldn't have my phone shutting off every few seconds.,1
"Incredible phone and the best for its price. It does everything your average smartphone user wants and does it well. Clean stock android, great screen, and the best speakers I've heard on a smartphone. (Seriously these things are loud). I couldn't see anyone being disappointed with recieving this phone.",5
Surprisingly good quality phone considering the low price compared to other phones. Have had it for over a week and dropped it twice and did not break or scratch. Has a decent amount of space with options to upgrade. Able to play all my games without any lag and plenty of room on the screen to see everything.,5
"Quality is amazing for the price .. Audio is nice, camera quality is pretty decent, charges very quickly and lasts for the day.. Well (It depends on how much you use it.) But to be honest, this is by far the best 100 bucks I've ever spent 😁Advise: Get a screen protecter, preferably glass and you're fine.",5
"Phone died after 30 days of use. Tried to restart phone, but phone started continuously powering on and off, rendering it unusable. A quick google search reveals that this is a common problem for this phone. Save yourself the trouble and do not buy it.",1
"Excellent phone for the price! Huge screen, beautiful, very light and the best speakers in a phone. Also the speakers are up and down and front facing so if you use it landscape mode you get excellent stereo (and loud) sound (e.g., for videos).",5
"Bought this phone on pre order. Nice screen, perfomance was ok and got better with the Marshmallow update, audio quality was amazing, also the included headphones were nice (they lasted 8 months). Phone stoped working one week after the warranty expired.",3
Awesome phone. Crystal Clear display. Loud speakers. I don't see the lag issues other have reported. Updated software and I am pleased with the camera. Looking forward to Android 5.1 update from Alcatel.,5
"This is defiantly the best phone I have ever owned! The speakers are phenomenal! They are loud, clear, and do have a little bit of bass! The display is also one of the best on any budget phone! Also the camera isn't bad either! But to wrap it all up, this is the best phone under $300!",5
"Best Phone I've owned so far, it is just amazing. i Love it. it is just as described. The sound quality is amazing, the Speed, the Camera, the gaming capabilities, watching videos on this device gives you the best experience, everything about this phone is awesome.For only $250.00 this is the best phone there is.",5
"Terrible call quality, multiple people told me during calls on speakerphone that I sounded far away and that they couldn't hear me well. Maybe it's due to the speakers during calls. I promptly returned. I wonder if the 4.7 inch version also has this same problem",2
"overall a very good phone and great value for its price.would love to have physical buttons, though, used to the samsung notes. there's sufficient real estate to put that in also.",4
"Lots of features for the price. Nice screen. Definitely made me wonder why my Motorola Nexus 6 is priced so much higher. (I got the Alcatel for my mother.)However, the SD card/SIM dual tray is awful. I couldn't get a SIM card inside, without ripping out the SD card electronics. Phone still works, but that terrible design choice makes me wary.",3
Phone stopped working after a software update in just month 2 of ownership. I have made 5 attempts to get phone fixed through customer service and have been unsuccessful each time. Do not buy.,1
Love this phone. Excellent battery life. Really good front camera. Great operating system.I would change a little the rear camera. It's good but take too long to stabalize and not take blurry photos.In general I would really recommend it for the price.,5
Awesome phone. My first smart phone and it's been nothing but great. Not sure how I loved without a smart phone before. Easy to navigate and use. Very intuitive.,5
No Chinese support!! This is a phone made from Chinese brand!! Why???? this should be inlcuded on lroduct description!!! ...Otherwise very nice phone.,2
This is a decent budget phone however the screen is very easy to break. Once it breaks it will keep randomly tapping places on your screen. The description talks about a two year warranty so hopefully that will be honored.,3
"well love the phone just wish some one would come up with a battery case for it, maybe one with wireless charging. it seems like a no brainer for all these phablets.",5
"Phone came in perfect conditions, fast shipping, it's a game changer, best phone for his price, specs, screen, batery.Just one thign it's that lag in his original Android 5.0, update after purchased to marshmallow y voila u have a awesome flashkiller",5
"What can I say?Great phone. Loud speakers, good camera, stock google lollipop!Great battery life!Bright screen, and processor barely shows its budget price.If you want a phone for 250, this is the best option for ya. Best all around phone at this price.",5
Great phone but it came with a couple of dead pixels right in the center of the screen. I've never run into dead pixels on a phone before. Returned and waiting for another.,3
This phone is a great phone that never seems to have a problem. It is very conformable in my hand. i have had it freeze 1 time but it was only for a couple of seconds and during a software update.,5
I wouldn't recommend this phone. Very poor battery life. Not very compatible with Ultra mobile. Lots of glitches. Should have known better just gonna stick with my nexus5 very fast and reliable. Don't waste your moneyon this phone.,1
"Touch screen stopped responding on the bottom 1/4 inch of the screen. This sucks as it is where all of the navigation buttons are. This phone is almost bran new, never dropped. Tried factory reset - no luck. Phone is now useless after 60 or so days.",1
It's a good for the price tag. I really liked the battery life and all other aspect. The screen design makes it difficult to recommend this phone. Thin phone + 5.5 display is prone to CRACK!!! My idol3 screen cracked in regular usage and I'm no longer able to use the phone.,3
"Good on paper only. Bad software and bad support. Do not buy this ""smart"" phone if you value listening to music.Initially google voice did not work. Then now bluetooth music stutters. Headphones music hiccups occasionally.Support for this phone is substandard. They will ask you to ship your phone and wait for a refurb or repaired phone for 2 weeks.",1
"The best audio, the most vivid colors, fast enough, altough average camera (i didn't expect much about this last point because of the comments i read before i bought it).",5
Do not buy this phone unless you want a phone that last 3 months the glue they used to attach the screen has weared off in 3 months so the screen is litlery pealing off my phone at this moment do not buy,1
I had for a couple of weeks with no problem. but then one day the just stop working it wont even let get into the homepage. I had to return it back. this that bs.,3
Not bad given the price .. But if u r coming from a high end device to this .. U will surely feel the performance hit .. This phones performance is very sluggish ..,4
Great device ... It's better than I expected !!!Great performance at low price ... u won't get that ultra mega performance like new flagships .. But u will get %80 of their performance at a fraction of their price !! It's a good deal :),5
Software and screen were lovely until the phone started to not display anything but colored lines. I wanted to like this phone and am really annoyed it broke within 48 hrs. No drops no wetness. I would get a replacement but I'm not a believer in the brand anymore,1
"Great performance, never run into any lagging. Nice and thin and fits well in my pocket (I was used to a 4"" phone!). Great screen and battery life. Dropped one star because the camera isn't all that great, particularly in low light.",4
"I just started using the phone this afternoon. When I picked up the phone, it felt surprisingly light, and my first thought was that it felt cheap. However, the phone looks actually pretty elegant and unassuming. So far I haven't had any problem with it yet.",4
This phone worked fantastic for about 6 months. Now it's constantly having issues functioning and seems to be progressively getting worse. Little to no updates from the company. Sorry but I definitely won't ever purchase another phone made my this company.,1
A great phone for the money. If you don't have to have the latest and greatest then check this phone out. Only missing 3gb(it has 2) ram as compared to other top flight phones.,5
This is a good phone for under 300 dollars.I would recommend this phone to anyone who don't want to spend a lot of money and want great performing phone.SG,5
Live the phone. Good reception not much bloatware . sluggish occasionally. Performance is great when not multitasking a lot. Camera is good.looks great I put a green slick wrap on mine. I'm happy with mine I upgraded slightly from an huawei ascend mate 2 because I'm tired of jellybean. Great for listening to music.,4
yes but I wish it was a 2k or 4k screen and the speakers was a little louder but other than that I love the phone for the price $249can't beat that or less it was $199but is OK,4

"haven't ever experienced terrible phone like this.it does not touch well. I have to click more than one time.one day i found that all the app data gone. I had to log in all the apps, and change the settings in each app.it works slow just like snapdragon 400 series",1
"Is an acceptable phone considering it costs about 140 dollarsOctacoreNice speakers (JBL)Acceptable screen.Android 6I havethis phone about a month, and restart only once. I don't know what will happen in the future, but is enough phone for me.",4
This phone failed 34 days after my order. I have no recourse to return based on the 30 day policy. There is not even a clear ability to communicate to Amazon about this.This is an unfortunate customer service issueWould not purchase again,1
"What can you say, it is made in China and that means GOOD REAL GOOD to me.I have several others and they are all excellent.I travel to China on vacation and I use a China Mobile Simm, no problems. GREAT PHONE.Uses AT&T and is really 4G LTE and it works great and in China is also excellent!!!!!!!",5

Very good product! An improvement over my 2 year old moto g no doubt. My one and only issue so far is that sometimes it doesn't respond right away opening an app,4
"Shipping pretty fast . They left it by my garage, not on my front door or mailbox , which confused me on where it was when I received the notification saying it was on my porch . But overall , it's in perfect shape and it works amazingly . Thank you",5
I have had this phone for almost a week. Not one problem. Other than a few lags here and there. A great phone for a unheard of price. I paid $150 for this phone and it runs and feels like a $800 flagship phone. Only down side is I wish it had 4 Gigabyte's of RAM and not the 2 Gigabyte's.,5
Phone suffered a screen crack riding in my pocket for 5 minutes while driving 2 months after being purchased. Not very durable. I would not buy it again.,1

"Hi.The description of the product say: Is global unlocked and can use in 4LTE but it doesnt work, If you can help me I'll really appreciate that.Anything else is ok.ALCATEL OneTouch Idol 3 Global Unlocked 4G LTE Smartphone, 5.5 HD IPS Display, 16GB (GSM - US Warranty)",3
"Nice phone for what I paid (99). I'd much rather pay this price whenever my phone breaks then paying 600-800 for another phone!Overall good buy. Works well, has nice features.",5
"Had this phone for 6 months now with no issues. Works just as well and better than any $700 phone I have had. Seriously folks, it's a phone. We call, we text and we surf the web, why pay $700 for the newest Samsung. It's crazy. Will never buy another high priced phone again.",5
OK so I got this and it was nice but I couldn't use it because I wanted straight talk and it was gmi or CDMA or GSM one of the two and was not compatible with my cell towers. I live in a rural area with limited Internet and cell phone service. I would buy from a local store. Especially your local Walmart if you want straight talk like me.,5
Worked without a glitch in the UK with a local SIM bought at Heathrow and just as well in Eastern Europe. Great phone for the price. Make sure you have the correct international plugs to use with the charger,5
"for the price is what you get, I would like to have the old school designs, with some modern functions, but now every cellphone seems to be very generic product on that segment, the screen is not so responsive, and it feels very very slow. for that segment of price I recommend a windows phone with abetter touchscreen.",3
"the phone is very good, 4,5-inch screen, touch very docile, is very nice, very well built, equipped and bluetooth, Gps, wifi, 3G, android kit kat 4.4.2, play store, whatsapp, and all applications android, finally very good phone, very low cost",5
"Is a great phone for the price, it is durable and does all the relevant things any modern phone can do. If you are looking for a simple and cheap workable smartphone don't look far.",5
"Great compact, economical phone. The only downside is the internal storage space. I can't even fit Twitter on my new phone as it wants to install everything on the internal memory.",3

A few things are less than perfect like answering when it rings. You have to swipe to answer and it often doesn't take. It does what I need it to and is a great value for the money.,4
"I love this phone, especially given the modest cost. It performs well on Freedompop and does not slow down at all as I keep adding applications. Excellent button recognition, even with large fingers.",5
"I needed a cheap phone to just be able to call, use whatsapp, listen to Spotify and use Runkeeper, and occasionally go online (no fancy app or game), and this phone is just perfect for that. No crash so far (I've had it for 6 months).",5
"Very disappointing overall unlocked phone says, but Venezuela did not work for me digitel 4g Lte, is a failure because in the comments and said that if work specifications.",1
"Item arrived 1.5 weeks late! I requested -and paid- for a 2-day shipment and did not receive the item on time.Quality was good. As expected.Case is black, but its back side has some shining pieces...which may be OK for women but not for men. Item description unfortunately did not clarify this.",3
"Not a global 4G LTE band, don't suport (B3)I bought this phone because I thought it was really unlocked 4G LTE world is global and even 3G UMTS is only ( 2G) GSM Quad Band Unlocked",1
"This is a good phone for the price, runs latest android and all needed apps very smoothly. Can do everything except take good selfies because the front camera isnt very good, but still usable in decent amount of light. Perfect for people who want to run a large selection of apps for a cheap price.",5
"Great compact, economical phone. The only downside is the internal storage space. I can't even fit Twitter on my new phone as it wants to install everything on the internal memory.",3
The phone is messed up do mot ever turn the phone off or reboot because the phone goes only as far as where it says alcatel onetouch i can't use my phone this day 2 and still can't use it.,1
"Super smarter-than-me phone, great for a newbie such as myself. I just wish the user's manual had print big enough to read. Even with my 2.5x reading glasses, I have to use a magnifying glass.",4
"Review after one week usage. No issues so far and completely satisfied.Its unlocked with dual sim.Sim card size is microI am using ultra mobile sim and an Indian sim on the phone, both works fineit also has 4G LTE",5

"please note the description of this phone, it clearly states the phone is unlocked, well the phone I received was LOCKED. I lost a week of service from straight talk because the phone did not work(like an unlocked phone should) this is/was so frustrating! How do you make this right?",5
First off I loved the phone! Then out of nowhere it shuts down and reboots out of nowhere!! It is seriously passing me off and going back to the windows 10 phone!!!!!,2
decent dual sim phone that gets the job done. The display is good but the the ZEN UI is not my cup of tea. Button layout are a bit to high up for me but it gets the job done as a backup phone. This does not work with Verizon or Sprint but works fine with ATT. I do recommend getting a case and tempered glass since the product feels cheap.,4
"Runs really smooth, near stock Android, really great screen, good speaker. Fingerprint scanner and camera are just ok. If you aren't a major multi-tasker the phone runs just fine. All in all a great value.",4
This was a Christmas present and the user is well satisfied with it. It was an upgrade from a much older phone. She finds it easier to text and to use.,5
"This phone comes in a kit. The kit is incomplete as the SIM card has been removed. In addition, the phone itself is refurbished. Returned for a refund.",3
Phone did not work long but I give 5 stars to the owner he worked with me and we solve the problem. I would do business again with him.I recommend doing business with him he stands by his product.,5
"So I have two of these phones and they both continually shut off for no reason. My sons are getting pretty tired of it. It's not a bad phone for a teenager that doesn't need to have a smart phone with social media options, but it is very annoying to have it shut off ALL the time on its own. Think twice before buying this one.",2

Piece of junk. The pics from the camera are very fuzzy/can't see them clearly. The volume is very low on the audio. To hear you mist use the earphone.,1
Great phone. Super screen. Only negative is that it connects to Amazon store and my account so purchases are not controlled if you give it to your kid.,4

"Phone does not hold charge. At all. Ordered replacement, replacement has the same problem. Phone looses charge in about 2 hours from 100% to 20% while NOT in use.",1
This crap DOES NOT WORK! They also do not tell you upfront the limitations of data that can be retrieved from phones or what types of phones are compatible.,1
"The phone is very responsive. Works perfectly with both sims. Wi-fi works well. I am not comfortable with pictures though. Not sure it is 8 mp. Screen gets dark while making calls. Overall, a very good phone.",4
"It's way too heavy, the camera sucks big time, it says is 8mp and its actually 2mp. The led never worked and the extra battery didnt either. the menu botton is too hard to use. Earphones were broken. Didnt like this cellphone at all. Please, re.check your choices before purchasing this.",2
"The phone is good, but when you are talking to someone,the volume level is very low, you can't hear the person very well unless you put it on speaker out which is not good, It need improvement.",4
Good phone..i just bought 2 of them..and i'm still waiting if something will happen in the future..but for now its still good and that price is good for a big phone like that with a case..,4
"This phone is the perfect size but the camera is terrible. It doesn't receive MMS messages, I have tried everything ! I wouldn't recommend this phone.",2
"the power button went out five mins after haveing it was a nice phone if it had worked , just got a bad one i guess but they got my refund to me write away",2
I'm ready to receive my phone hope its great .After I reveiew what ppl said about this device .... sounds like a great big phone ;) I like big phones ..,5
"Very poor quality. Has the oldest version of Android on them, Bought them to take on a deployment. These were the slowest and I could not use them. Threw them in the trash. Dont buy.",1

Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever.,5
"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star.",4
"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!",4
"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it.",1
Very satisfied with the quality. This was the first time I'd bought a used phone and I'm very satisfied. The return policy and pictures made me feel better about ordering and I'm likely to do this again in the future.,5
"After reviewing the phone and trying everything ywsteady to switch over to this phone it would not work. I ordered a new sim as well. Long story short, boh were a waste of my time and money and the phone did not come with a charger. The phone itself is in great condition, but was a waste for me.",1
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
Honestly freaked me out a little because it did not come with a sim card but I should'nt have expected that anyways. The seller gave nice institutions on what to do about getting a sim card and activating the phone. My phone is now activated and i am very happy!,5
This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day!,5
This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time.,1
"I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great!",5
"The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all..",2
"This works great! Exactly as described, like-new in case with all accessories and even included a Verizon sim-card. Activated quickly with no problems. I've now had for about 2 months and it works like a charm!",5
"Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless.",5
LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :),5
"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone.",4
"When I received it, it didn't come with SIM card and the speaker in the phone didn't work, so I couldn't hear anything. It also wouldn't make a call. The phone looked in new condition, but unfortunately didn't work. But I returned it with no questions asked and the process was very easy.",1
"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile.",5
It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page.,2
"Came in great condition. No SIM included and the information booklet was missing, as well as a few dints. However this was as expected so overall I am stoked!",4
"I purchased this phone from cellcow through Amazon. The phone was a piece of junk. It acts possessed, randomly switching screens and typing without my even touching it. Save your money!",1
"The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase.",3
Received as advertised: Verizon Wireless Apple iPhone 5c. Took it to the Verizon store and had them insert a SIM card and it works great. No complaints.,5
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
"I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the ""P"" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT.",4
"There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up.",4
"iphone came in original Apple packaging and in only two days with standard shipping. Works with Verizon just like the ad says. New condition, no scuffs or anything. Thanks!",5
These things are extremely brittle. If you were to purchase one I would highly suggest investing in a heavy duty case. I literally have gone through 4 in the last year and I treat it very carefully.Otherwise a nice piece of technology.,3
The iPhone 5c I received is great. The charger and USB cable that came with it have issues. By trial and error I determined the charger barely works. The USB cable has a very small break in it at the edge where it connects with the phone port. It's a disappointment that I have to replace these items immediately.,4
"This phone was NOT compatible with the Verizon network. I had to get a new phone and pay just as much for it. TERRIBLE marketing, don't believe it when it says it is verizon compatible.",1
This phone is stuck in the year 1970 and when I try to change the year it just keeps skipping over all of them.. and then the screen wouldn't work when I plugged it in with the charger.. really hope this can be a quick fix otherwise I'll be very disappointed...waste of my money I guess.,3
"Perfect condition. Barely looks touched. No scrapes, scratches or Knicks. It came completely cleaned out and ready for me to use. Charges super fast. No technical issues",5
"Great phone replacement for our other phone. Shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren't as many defects on the phone as described. It was better.",5
"Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months...",2
Honestly freaked me out a little because it did not come with a sim card but I should'nt have expected that anyways. The seller gave nice institutions on what to do about getting a sim card and activating the phone. My phone is now activated and i am very happy!,5
Bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and the phone will not hold a charge. Have to take it to an Apple store to have it repaired. Very unhappy about this.,1
My son is disatisfied with his phone. It does not consistently work. He isn't able to text or answer calls part of the time. Not sure if it just needs a new screen.,1
"This phone was labeled to be in ""good condition"" instead of excellent or like new- it seemed brand new! No scratches or anything. Very pleased with this purchase.",5
"Phone was glitchy, screen becomes unresponsive in the middle and you can only touch the top and bottom of it until you turn it off and turn it back on. Happens at least 20x a day if you open your phone 30x",1
"The phone arrived promptly as it was a Christmas present. However, the screen began to lift two days after Christmas and the phone froze up. Returned the item on January 6, 2015 and waiting patiently for a return.",2
Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever.,5
"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price.",5
"After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone.",1
Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone.,1
The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone.,3
"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money.",1
Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store,5
"I received the phone on time. The phone works really good, but there is a scratch on the back but its not really a big deal for me. I would recommend this phone and the apple outlet store. 100% satisfied on this phone.",4
"Great price for working product in good condition. They did leave out the fact that you need to buy new sim card with this phone, which may have been common sense but it still would have been nice to know. The charger cord that came with it also quit working within a couple of days.",4
"The phones screen broke right away, and just keeps cracking. The refurbisher did not do a good job. Plus the battery dies constantly. Hope others take the time to provide feedback so the rip off doesn't continue.",1
"I'm extremely happy with my purchase. It was a present for my son. The price was great. The pictures weren't entirely accurate. My experience is that the phone that arrived was in much better condition than the one in the pic. I called and asked them to ship it earlier, which they did.",5
"The phone I received was defective. The wifi function of the phone did not work. Thankfully, I had full insurance on my broken iphone that I was attempting to replace. Verizon covered the cost of this phone and provided me with a new one. Never again will I purchase a refurbished phone through Amazon.",1
"Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great!",4
Cosmetically it matched the description. It took 2 hours to get the phone activated at the Verizon store. I was worried it was not going to work. The phone keeps freezing and I have to keep resetting it to get text messages.,2
Have had the phone a couple months. Daughter dropped it on a carpeted floor from only about 3 ft away - cracked the screen. I doubt we'll be replacing it with another i5 as we hear that is a problem with them.,3
"The speaker did not work. I had to trade it to Verizon for $43 because my 11 year old son had been waiting to activate it. We took it in to activate it and it didn't work so I had to buy one at Verizon so as not to disappoint my son on his birthday, He brought his grades up to earn it. I was out $60 and got a phone contract I did not want.",1
"I usually don't complain if something isn't too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. The back is also badly scrapped up! It didn't even come with a charger!",1
nice price for phone but the motherboard of the phone sticks and i cant text or do anything with the phone. i thought i wait it out to see what else can be done for the phone nothing,1

"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star.",4
"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!",4
"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it.",1
"There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up.",4
"iphone came in original Apple packaging and in only two days with standard shipping. Works with Verizon just like the ad says. New condition, no scuffs or anything. Thanks!",5
"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money.",1
Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store,5
Very satisfied with the quality. This was the first time I'd bought a used phone and I'm very satisfied. The return policy and pictures made me feel better about ordering and I'm likely to do this again in the future.,5
"Phone was glitchy, screen becomes unresponsive in the middle and you can only touch the top and bottom of it until you turn it off and turn it back on. Happens at least 20x a day if you open your phone 30x",1
"The phone arrived promptly as it was a Christmas present. However, the screen began to lift two days after Christmas and the phone froze up. Returned the item on January 6, 2015 and waiting patiently for a return.",2
My son is disatisfied with his phone. It does not consistently work. He isn't able to text or answer calls part of the time. Not sure if it just needs a new screen.,1
"This phone was labeled to be in ""good condition"" instead of excellent or like new- it seemed brand new! No scratches or anything. Very pleased with this purchase.",5
"I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great!",5
"I received the phone on time. The phone works really good, but there is a scratch on the back but its not really a big deal for me. I would recommend this phone and the apple outlet store. 100% satisfied on this phone.",4
"Great price for working product in good condition. They did leave out the fact that you need to buy new sim card with this phone, which may have been common sense but it still would have been nice to know. The charger cord that came with it also quit working within a couple of days.",4
"The phones screen broke right away, and just keeps cracking. The refurbisher did not do a good job. Plus the battery dies constantly. Hope others take the time to provide feedback so the rip off doesn't continue.",1
"I'm extremely happy with my purchase. It was a present for my son. The price was great. The pictures weren't entirely accurate. My experience is that the phone that arrived was in much better condition than the one in the pic. I called and asked them to ship it earlier, which they did.",5
"The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all..",2
"Perfect condition. Barely looks touched. No scrapes, scratches or Knicks. It came completely cleaned out and ready for me to use. Charges super fast. No technical issues",5
"Great phone replacement for our other phone. Shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren't as many defects on the phone as described. It was better.",5
"Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months...",2
It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page.,2
"Came in great condition. No SIM included and the information booklet was missing, as well as a few dints. However this was as expected so overall I am stoked!",4
Cosmetically it matched the description. It took 2 hours to get the phone activated at the Verizon store. I was worried it was not going to work. The phone keeps freezing and I have to keep resetting it to get text messages.,2
Have had the phone a couple months. Daughter dropped it on a carpeted floor from only about 3 ft away - cracked the screen. I doubt we'll be replacing it with another i5 as we hear that is a problem with them.,3
"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile.",5
This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day!,5
This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time.,1
Received as advertised: Verizon Wireless Apple iPhone 5c. Took it to the Verizon store and had them insert a SIM card and it works great. No complaints.,5
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
"Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great!",4
"The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition. When I received it there were scratches on it, the screen pops up in one corner, and all the accessories were fake with a mispelled word on it. I was very disappointed with this product.",2
"Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless.",5
LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :),5
"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone.",4
"I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the ""P"" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT.",4
Bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and the phone will not hold a charge. Have to take it to an Apple store to have it repaired. Very unhappy about this.,1
"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price.",5
"After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone.",1
"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star.",4

"Shipping took a bit, but the phone is in excellent condition and has made my life extremely easier. Bbrewer2 was very polite and got back to me quickly.",5
"This I phone 4s 64 GB was advertise as brand new.--I called apple to register my phone, apple said the phone was 2 years old. No warranty. I contacted the seller. They didn't seem to care. I asked for them to sell the phone as use. They said no. Just returned. I paid 600. For this phone! To find out it's used. So buyers be careful.",1
I tried using strait talk as my provider but the iPhone doesn't use it. The internet doesn't work at all. I was told it did work with straight talk. It doesn't,2
"Love my new phone. This seller is very honest and upfront. I specifically asked for a brand new ""sealed"" phone and that's exactly what I got. I'm thrilled, thank you DivaTek",5
"I ordered one of this, the iPhone is very good and as it says on description.But the accessories are not original.Also, I paid for the 1day delivered and it came within 3 days.",3
I just love this phone! It has everything I need! Only miss the inteligent SMS writing I had on my old Sony but that can be easily forgiven! Also this has been my best friend since I broke my right hand because it is very easy to write with my left hand also! I definitely recommend it to everyone!,5
Lost my phone in thye atlanta airport and had to buy another international phone. I got it here and it has been a great buy it had everything that the seller said and I have been very pleased with how it works. Very good phone to have does everything the Iphone 5 does without the price increase.,5
"It does as described. Enjoy the iPhone so far... Little disappoint with the battery...it still last me for a whole day. Overall, great product for a good price.",4
"The screen was scratched quite a bit. I expected that of the casing but not of the screen since, it seems that everybody uses a screen protector now a days. The rest was fine.",3
"This phone is in like new condition as far as I can tell, works great and holds a good charge. No issues with its unlocked status. (I'm using it on TMobile.) Delivery was prompt to Amazon Locker.",5
"I had to take this phone in after owning it for 3 months (kept in a life-proof case). I was told by Apple that it was a refurbished phone, the screen is loose, and I am having software problems. This was not a new phone as advertised.",1
These guys are awesome! The phone was just as described: brand new factory GSM unlocked iPhone 5s 16gb! They even included a screen protector! I would definitely purchase something again from them!,5
"Extremely dissatisfied, we received the phone and have had constant issues, we received the blue screen of death multiple times, the phone refuses to charge, randomly shuts off, the screen will become unresponsive. DO NOT BUY YOUR PHONE FROM THESE PEOPLE!",1
"Ordered a brand new apple iphone 5s factory unlocked ., item came in an OPENED box without charger and the item doesn't look like brand new having lots of dust on it.",1
Do NOT buy This phone it was not unlocked as it said. It would NOT work with Verizon yet seller stated it would. I spent 1 hour 38 minutes with Verizon trying to figure it out. They called apple and Apple would not unlock it. The phone will NOT work with Verizon.,1
the phone is used refurbished not in new condition which someone else had used. other than that needs to put this on the add. phone is fine. beware . found out when we took in the att. oh well live and learn should have read the reviews before we purchased..,3
"I phone 5S was used and with water damage. Purchased phone 4 months ago it was stated ""new"". It stop holding a charge. Took it to Apple and they were able to see that the contact liquid indicator was tampered with indicating water damage and based on the serial # it was activated in 2014 !",1
"It was perfect, with a little defecto on the screen, but they offered yo resolve the problem with 0 Cost, I'm from Argentina, so I left it like this and my san didn't note it. For now, It's everything ok!",4
"This phone was sold as new but after three months of use I got blue screen, was told by apple that the phone is refurbished and had the same problem, not honest, false advertisement.",1
Ordered 2. Excellent phone but needed to return one because grandaughter decided to keep old phone and they would not let me return because past return date. Will never order from these people again!,1
I helped buy this phone for my boyfriend and he has no complaints about it even though it was previously owned. It is in excellent condition and honestly i wouldnt have been able to tell it was used if it didnt say so.,5
"Much smaller than I expected, but still the product is high-end, you can tell it is well-made, with good materials.The seller was top-notch, and the product is being used in Argentina, so it is genuinely unlocked to use internationally with any GSM company.",4
"The screen was scratched quite a bit. I expected that of the casing but not of the screen since, it seems that everybody uses a screen protector now a days. The rest was fine.",3
"Please Don't Buy it. I bought it and gifted it to my father. He could not use it for 3 months. Local i center told the phone was repaired three times before sold. Total treachery. So please, please dont buy it.",1
A good phone overall looks as described. No scratches on the front whatsoever. Also here a day earlier than estimated time. If you are looking for a phone with an acceptable price you should try this! Also functional.,4
"Great experience. Product way much better than advertised and expected. I ordered a very good item and received a brand new product. Excellent seller, 200% recommended.",5
This phone works great! Fast shipping was unlocked and just popped my SIM card right in. Definently recommend for anyone in a hurry for a new phone. Much easier than trying to find one in Craigslist or Letgo.,5
"This phone is in like new condition as far as I can tell, works great and holds a good charge. No issues with its unlocked status. (I'm using it on TMobile.) Delivery was prompt to Amazon Locker.",5

It works just like it's supposed to only problem is for payment it doesn't take my visa and the camera on the inside doesn't work so that's very upsetting.,4
"The battery icon is not accurate, reset too many time!!! Charging only goes up to 54% and sometime without charging say ""the battery is at a 100%"" and dies too many times. It better to just spend 100-300 more dollar for your money worth.",1
"great phone, just as described. perfect conditions and fast shipping. ! love my new phone, but the screen freezes once in a while ): but has not caused any problems.",4
"The telephone came up closed, attached to one particular company (TMobile). I didn't understand at the time of buying the product this important detail. It was not clear to me.I have not been able yet to use the telephone till today.After years of been an AMAZON customer this is the very first time that something like this happened.Allan Matamoros",2
Phone came in looking fine in reality the screen was broken and had popped off wasted all of my money very unpleased for paying this much for a broken iPhone,1
"I'm very happy with this phone. It was refurbished, but in excellent condition, and so far, has been very dependable. My only disappointment has been the inability to record voice memos and get a loud enough play to hear well. It is very very faint. Other than that, I'm very pleased.",5
"The phone came with some crusty crap on the screen. Seriously? The seller couldn't wipe it off? Also the touch screen doesn't work. Like, it won't swipe or press or anything. If Apple can't fix it for free I'm returning it.",1
"I bought it a year ago and the speaker didn't work very well, I couldn't hear people talking when they called me or I called them. Thankfully it was still covered under apple care so I got a brand new one.",4
"Absolutely love this phone and the service from the seller, fast shipping. Didn't mind much about the cable, cared more for the phone and it is great!",5
Freezes at times and screen didn't always display what you need during emailsOver all it's okIt should be less for the glitches that come with it though,3
I've been an android user since the first galaxy. Ended up geting tired of all the issues: freezing randomly etc. No complaints about this phone. Love it!!,5
"Well when I purchased it for my teen for a grad gift he loved it until he found out that it was on the block list which means it was still locked and the person that had it prior never paid it off smh..I tried to get my son to let me send it back but he wouldn't part with it,Now I hv to pay additional money to get it unlocked!",2
"The phone is great its fast, and reliable with a long battery life, and the delivery was extremely fast I was very pleased with your service and the quality of this phone.",5
"Came looking new and nice does have a lot of technical issues. Keep having to restart my phone at least twice a day sometimes more, which I don't feel like a ""brand new"" phone should have this many issues already",3
"The screen feels a bit lose, or at least the one I got. I could've gotten a better deal but It's what it is. The quality is actually not so bad, it's just the screen and...the white frame. It's a bit yellowish",3
"I was hesitant in buying an iPhone 6, especially since my android was giving me too many problems. Even though I really liked my Google phone, this phone does not freeze on me, it does not randomly turn off, and it is reliable. The phone came in perfect condition with no visible scratches. I'm very happy with my product.",5
"it's a great product, of course not much different than the previous models, but the new features are great for anyone who uses them, I definitely don't but I may end up getting used to having them.",4
"I received my phone in September and a month and a half after it stopped working since apparently the phone was originally on a payment plan, and now I can't return the product since the return period already expired. This seller scams it costumers by selling full-price phones that stop working after two months.",1
"so far so good, feels lighter than iPhone 5 tho I know it's slightly heavier but design is less clunky. like that I don't mistype as often (and I have small fingers). my aging eyes appreciate that app icons can be slightly enlarged to take advantage of larger screen",5
"My 15 year old son worked on the weekends to get this phone. And when he had his money saved up he was happy to purchased it. We could have bought it for him. But he insisted that he wanted to work for it. Legit iPhone, shipping was fast. We had no problem connecting it to T-Mobile. Really happy with the phone.",5
"Well,I now know why it was so cheap,it came with nothing,not even a charger..not that that would have helped,the battery is nearly useless,it doesn't stay charged for even 12 hours and I have not even used it yet... pay full price,you're better off! Very disappointed for nearly 500 bucks!",2
"Wow awesome IPhone. There was a little glitch on getting the Phone to me, but when I got a hold of Adam, he fix it and sent my phone. I got it the next day.This item was as he described new and unopened. I will differently order from him again.",5
"Reliable supplier, excellent product , delivered on time, product exactly as per the mentioned descriptionDefinitely will do business with somethingfromeverythingNew iPhone provided is amazing thanks",5
"the phone is very run down for the price, it works well but has too much detail as if it had been dragged across the floor !! according to the photos was in better shape, I felt cheated me!",2
To be honest I really hesitated to buy a phone offline. My phone came in today and everything was better than expected. I def. recommend buying from them.,5
"I bought it a year ago and the speaker didn't work very well, I couldn't hear people talking when they called me or I called them. Thankfully it was still covered under apple care so I got a brand new one.",4
"My phone came in as stated and honestly looks like it's been used for less than a month. The estimate of ""Good"" for the condition was an underestimate, frankly, and with a case, it will look brand new! Saved so much money through estock and I am SO pleased!",5
"The battery icon is not accurate, reset too many time!!! Charging only goes up to 54% and sometime without charging say ""the battery is at a 100%"" and dies too many times. It better to just spend 100-300 more dollar for your money worth.",1
"Excellent phone, the only problem was the charger but overall it said that the phone was used yet when it came it was like brand new and everything works great too",5
Phone came to me clean and beautiful looked like it was never used before. Shipped to me super fast in only 2-3 days. Problem came with activation... Whoever had this phone HAS AN OUTSTANDING BALANCE and it will not allow me to unlock this phone for use. I am promptly returning it ASAP buyer beware...,1
I don't know where to start. But I recently bought this iPhone 6 and it's simply great. Just as described. For a phone to be used! This phone looks untouched and new! 😊😊😊👌🏻,5

I'm very pleased with my Apple IPad Mini 3. I bought it because I was running out of space on my iPad Mini 1. I trust Amazon to deliver quality products and I have yet to be disappointed.,5
"I love my ipad it came on time, my package came bundle up it was extra protected I already set everything up its everything I excepted nd more I recommend who ever to get it love it....",5
"iPad will not turn on. Just get a white screen with the apple logo. Have had problems intermittently with it, but nothing a quick restart didn't fix. Should have known better. I wouldn't recommend buying these.I have contacted the seller and have not heard back from them at this point. Will update.",1
"I purchased this Mini 4 months ago, and immediately after the 90 day return policy, the Mini stopped accepting a charge. For $250, that is not acceptable to me, and now my daughter is not able to use it.",1
"Screen had large obvious scratch, back of ipad had large dent in the body/frame, buttons messed up. Box it came in looked like it came out of a dumpster! How on earth is this considered refurbished?????Dont waste your money.",1
iPad was scratched badly on the back (3 huge scratches and many smaller ones) and non-original power adapter was not not working. I had to throw it away and use the one i have for my iPhone. Shame to see something like this on Amazon.,2
"I was definitely skeptical about buying the refurbished version of this product but upon arrival as I looked over it thoroughly, I seen no scratches no bumps or dents and it works absolutely wonderfully as it should.",5
"The iPad arrived and I figured it would have some cosmetic issues or dings, but no it was in pristine cobdition. Looked absolutely new.I will definitely be recommending this to others.",5

"this G2 iphone look good but did not work as well the ""ring volume is very low on high also did not have pin replace the SIM chip I would not recomend this this iphone in this condition if can't her the phone ring there need to be better quality control ...",2
"First of all, its no compatible with verizon (may affect you may not)... second, it doesn't fit anything on it, its old and its way overpriced for its quality..... this should be worth $2",1
Amazon sent this phone in like new condition. The problem I have is that I didn't realize how outdated this iPhone is compared to the newest generations.... If you just want an iPhone then it is a good bargain.,4
"Hey for a cheap price it was good I bought it and thought it was going to be broken, but really good condition but don listen to anyone else the phone is amazing and I only spent around $45 for the phone, charger, and a SIM card but from different sellers too",5
This is my daughters phone and she used that phone until she couldn't use it anymore. It is a very durable phone because my grandson chucked it all the time and it didn't crack or anything. Worth the money.,4
I had to have it unlocked which cost money! I had to have the speaker fixed bc I couldn't hear anyone on it! Over all I should have not bought this phone...,1
I'm really enjoying it. It functions as advertised. I would recommend it for anyone that needs a simple basic phone that can be used as a camera and to surf the web and get all their correspondence online.,5
"Had to pay a shop to fix it before I could use it!The charger that came with the phone was bad,so the phone would not charge! Not knowing it was the charger I took it to a shop to see what the problem was and they found the phone was improperly assembled ( missing screws) and the mute button was broken!",1
"Love the phone, still in good condition, screen is perfect. The only thing is I have to bring to have it unlock so I can use with my sim card. It would be an extra fee to have unlock. Still would buy it again.",4
"You can't upgrade the operating system, so most of the apps I want to get like from Facebook, my local grocery store, or for weather channel, I can't get them. I also can't find any of the older apps for Facebook.",2
"When I received a used iphone, it was defective and did not match the description. I contacted Monsterbuyback to let them know and they were supremely cooperative. They apologized and were very speedy with their return of my money. Great company! Reputable and trustworthy! Thanks Monsterbuyback!",5
"good producto,,, buen buen excellente precio,, rapido envio,,, excellente servicio, empaque adecuado no muy grande y si pequeño,buena comunicacion e informacion del articulo",5
"This phone shipped faster than I thought it would and I was very glad! (:It arrived in very good condition, just as it was described and I have had no problems with this product(:I would definitely buy from this seller again!GodBlessxoxo",5
I got this phone for a friend and it was absolutely terrible. There were scratches all over it. Took it to many different companies and none of them knew how to fix it. Couldnt set up to call anyone or basically do anything with it. I am hoping that he will give me a refund for it. The seller had better.,1
phone works for calling but other features such as camera and web doesnt work. so for emergency purposes it was ok.it was a I phone without any features.. but I will use when in car..,3
I considered this phone because it had the features and price I was comfortable with. In fact I'm recommending this to friends at the moment. the only thing I don't like its locked I thought it was opened . Now I have to unlock it which I cant give a complete review until I do .It looks ok to me. Thanks!,4
"""New"" cell was not. It had multiple registration numbers, broken and bent posts to charge. WE did get the money we spent refunded but the whole thing was a hassle. Too many problems!",1
"Unless you know how to jail break this phone... what's the point? Most apps don't support this old phone. <(it's not really old, they just want you to spend money on the newer version. wtf? but whatever)>",1
Just okay! Should have done my research before buying! The IOS is upgradeable and my grandson couldn't day any of the things he was use to doing on his Android!,3
"Thanks for the great phone!It was in almost perfect condition, so happy with my puchase. Such a vintage, fun phone to have. Shipped quickly, Thanks again!",5
Its an awesome buy. No one believes me when i tell them how much i paid for this phone.Its unbelievably new and in good condition. Great! Great! Great!,5
I gave this item 5 stars because it's a five stars item .I like that it works fine just the way it was described by the seller .I do recommend this item to every one .,5
"arrived in time before my trip, thanks a bunch! Apparently the phone was still locked! costed me an extra $40 to unlocked the unit so it could be used in Mexico. No big deal but thought I mention...Phone was in great condition as per description. Thank you",5
A nice inexpensive phone (in its day) bought used BUT it will not run any of the new apps as its OS cannot be upgraded. It works well as a basic backup phone and as a music player. that's about it.,3
phone wont stay lit.and ringer button moves on it's own.can't tell if someone is calling.can't see screen to turn on speaker or to know if your call has ended THE PHONE DOSE NOT WORK!!!!!!!!!!,1
Had to activate the phone but the SIM card tray is missing. This was not mention on the description. Brought it to the store to get another SIM tray and couldn't not insert the tray. Had to pay the store to fix it. Waste of money!! Scam!,1
"Though the touch pads are a bit too sensitive and the phone do sometimes 'misbehave' by self-dialing unintended contacts,phone is generally outstanding and meets my expectations.I can't ask for better!",5
"The product was in fantastic conditions, problem is that Iphone 3G is a lite bit ""old"" to support some Apps like Whatsapp. Not taking into account this, it is an excellent product, works perfectly.There was a miss delivery but was rapidly ammended and product was finally delivered to me.",4
I wish I had known that apple no longer supported this device. I can get no apps and the software is slow and antiquated. I feel like a fool for spending this money on this device which is basically useless.,1
I have had an iphone 3G previously and I loved it. This iphone was working fine for 2-3 weeks and now it won't turn on. I was told I need to replace the battery which is $80 . At this point I should have sprung for a new iphone!,2
"I didn't like the iphone at first because it arrived locked. After much investigating how to unlock the phone, I am relieved to say that everything worked out just fine. The iPhone is unlocked & my son is enjoying it.",3
"this item came better than i thought it would the only scratches are at the back n its hardly visible the front is very clean, delivery came on time, n its just perfect and for a good price...btw had to unlock it at a dealer bt no big problem.",5
"The phone that Amazon sent me was all scratched up, and it honestly looked as if the dropped it a few time then rubbed steel wool on the back of it. Thumbs down. This is one customer that wont be buying from Amazon anymore.",1
"MEET MY EXPECTATIONS IN 100%. ARRIVE ON TIME. PERFECT CONDITIONS TOTALLY RECOMMENDED. iPhone 3G, USB Wall Adapter Charger with USB to Dock Connector cable",5
The phone features were excellent. Minor cosmetic damages. Nice color. The seller provided instant feedback and answered all my questions. I would buy again based on quality and customer service.,5
"IPhone 4 are now 4 models old but if you are looking for a phone to ply games on itunes or just make basis call, or access facebook this is a great phone. I bought it just to access games on itunes. Apple makes a great product but this is not the latest and greatest phone out there.",4
My first apple product honestly. To little to late really. Slow and basically useless at this point in history. I jailbroke it and messed around with all the options that infers. Slow mostly unusable like I said. A fun toy for the tech savy customer. Junk to everyone else.,2
"Everything is outdated! You literally can't download any apps. Kik, sc, etc. The safari breaks down all the time too. Waste of money. Only thing that works is the camera with bad quality.",1
"Love the phone, still in good condition, screen is perfect. The only thing is I have to bring to have it unlock so I can use with my sim card. It would be an extra fee to have unlock. Still would buy it again.",4
"You can't upgrade the operating system, so most of the apps I want to get like from Facebook, my local grocery store, or for weather channel, I can't get them. I also can't find any of the older apps for Facebook.",2

Battery was utter bad. the was battery was getting dried up every 1 one hour.. Also they said that phone was new but when we went to apple store they told that this was phone was refurbished..,1

"In the beginning I liked it, but then I lost the unblocking stuff when I connected it to the web and i couldn'y use it any more. It's in my desk as decoration.",2
"it is not unlocked. i gotta unlock it to be able to used my simple mobile phone.. although the phone works very good, but the seller said it was unlocked, when it is not.",2
The best advice one may receive is do not ever buy a cell phone online. For all intensive purposes it is now illegal for Verizon Wireless to put their SIM card into an iPhone at the store. It makes no sense but trust me just don't do it. The iPhone 4S is way better anyway,1
I do not like the way they handling. 1 photo can use in China and Verizon co. Then marked unlocked. 2. Return is allowed. Actually return is not allowed because I opened package.,1
"I DID NOT HAVE THIS PHONE TO LONG, BECAUSE OF THE HARD SKIN FACEPLATE. IT COULDN'T FIT ON CORRECTLY, when attempting to put cover on my cell kept going on and off and then completely quit working.",2
Excellent model for all the use I give to mobile devices. Operating system and quick access to all the applications I use daily. 100 percent preferred.,5
"IPhone has passcode that prevent us from openning the mobile. We want to unlock the phone but the passcode needs to be known first. Passcode was not given despite mails sent to seller. Now, we are unable to use the mobile and its of no use purchasing the item.",1
"i got amazing celphone now . i loved it , althought i dont used it as a celphone more on ipod and i download a lot of games . but im definitely satisfied with it .thats why i always stick with amazon . they got quality product than any other site .",5
"i orderd iphone 3gs phone from this seller, i got it one day late, and i found that camara is not working, then i take this phone to Apple store, since this seller sold Factory unlocked new phone, my phone was replaced with new iphone in apple store.",4
"With this are several things wrong'1- I wanted to be unlock, it was not2- The batteries does not hold charge.3- it coming apart.So, the only thing I will say is the I lost 219.99",1
My dear friend has been agreed to be with original box and original charger and I did not find Box nor original ChargerPlease advise and tell me where the imbalanceNote that the goods have been shipped outside the U.S.Thanks,1
The phone was just like they said it is awesome. It was delivered within the time they said . I wish I was paying attention an gotten the 4GS instead. I will be purchashing another Iphone soon. Great price great service great product . Thank you Amazon.,5
"One of the iphones is not working I sintonized it with itunes and now is blocked. the others do not work well. I'm trying to return them but is not easy because I'm in argentina and i don't want to take the risk to stay without phones and no money. I'm really desapointed with this order!! I want my money back, I feel swindled.",1
First time the phone does not opened.... upon return ... the phone loses network frequently .....?These phones are not factory unlocked iPhones hence you will never be able to use latest iOS. upon request they will send some not standard way of jailbreaking which does not work .... Loss of money .....,1
it was advertised working and open line but it was not working. apple checked it but they said that it needs to be uploaded with the software which costs more that the price of new one.i still didn't hear anything from the seller 'coz i want to return and get my money back.,1
this phone is jailbreaked and can not be used with a normal contract. I ended up at the apple store and they told me this I phone was not able to be unblocked,1
It was advertised as an unlocked iPhone but it came with the AT&T SIM card still in it. My SIM did not work. I'm currently working on unlocking it so my SIM card does work.It would be good if folks knew that unlocked doesn't mean the contract is expired.,4
"This hand set is good. I bought it for gift. My niece likes it and still using it. The merchandise arrived on time, no problems.I know this is even off market now otherwise it works fine.",4
"Good morning,I cheated this is a mockery of the two phones are bad does not work, the seller sap well that these teams are not operating this is an abuse, but no matter which god bless them.regardsLuis Berroteran",1
Apple is known for their design and products. So there is nothing to say much. This model became bit outdated but still it full fills all my needs and a best device for a person like me.,5
"I've bought this cell phone in august and it is already not working. It is showing no service, but we bought it unlocked. There is any password that we should type? we went to apple store and they also weren't able to fix it.Thank you in advanced!Hope to hear from you soon!Regards",1
"It did not work well as i thought, i used it in spain, and it stoped working after about 6mths, the screen became blank and i could not aswer the phone",3
"The Wi-Fi chip freaked out after about a month, but i bought a new one right on Amazon and fixed it. Otherwise from that minor setback which was fixed the phone was superb.",4
I order iphone on my birthdayand recived only box from iphone!Right now I made a refound and going send box backbut it `s really do not uinderstand this guyWhy He try sell box from iphone?,1
The product was in great condition and shipment was timely. I would recommend any body to use the service. My experience with this product was one of rewarding.,4
Really loved the use I got out of this phone while I had it for 3 months. Was a go between before getting my current Samsung Galaxy S II phone. Good little phone.,4
"I would have liked to know more about ordering ipods so I could have helped my grandkids make thecorrect order. As it stands, the wrong items were ordered and only one of them has indicated arefund will be issued.",2
"I bought this item for my dad in Africa and he loves it. He says I made a difference in his life because no one has an Iphone deep in the village. he called and told me one day robbers were about to cut off his hand when they saw him with it. to cut the story short, Go Amazon. you are the best.",5
"not good returned, stil did not get my money back. the phone was locked and used not new nor refurbished that means I specind $30 dollars ot unlock and still not taking charger and not working properly.",1
"Purchaseeed the Apple iPhone It came early, and everything works, even came with cord and wall adapter and speck cases really happy i got it at this time",5
The SIM card slot never worked. I had to replace the slot by paying extra. Wasnt unlocked. Its defnitely not worth the money spent to buy this especially since i wanted to gift this phone.,1
"preserved baseband, easily to be jailbroken for keeping unlock while upgrading to the latest iOS version, and i did it...come with original box.. hope you can sale the same thing again...",5
It was not unlocked and I could not get a refund. I had to pay fr it to be unlocked. I think that it was not worth the amount it was advertised for considering the fact I had to pay for a fctory unlock.,3
Phone was broken in three places. I took it to an expert who told me I was ripped off. They could not even activate it because it was so internally damaged! Buyers beware!!,1
I was in the market for a a nice different gift for my wife and I found it . when she saw it she loved it . She wore it the next day to work to show it off .I would recommend it to anyone.,5
"Thanks! I wasn't expecting the phone to be unlocked AND on iOs 6!!! Thanks so much. I have to meet the character requirement to submit this, so here it is.",4
I do not like the way they handling. 1 photo can use in China and Verizon co. Then marked unlocked. 2. Return is allowed. Actually return is not allowed because I opened package.,1

"In the beginning I liked it, but then I lost the unblocking stuff when I connected it to the web and i couldn'y use it any more. It's in my desk as decoration.",2
"So it's not the newest phone out there, so what. This phone was cheaper than getting an iPod of same GB size. It's an apple product so good support, good apps.",5
"Product in good condition but incomplete, because i miss miss accessories had the doubt if so go on and buy it had bought a better one because i had to make additional spending",1
got just like they said and im happy with it however it was missing the on/off switch cover and I had to have that repaired but my otter box cover is the only thing that keeps it in place- phone looks and works fine but I was a tad disappointed with the missing part,4
I bought this phone for my son & he loves it especially it's being his first iPhone. Great product at a great price. Item arrived at the time it said it would,5
On the description for the iphone It said it didnt work but could be fixed but it wasnt coming on and you didnt drop it or do anything to it! but i took it to the shop to be fixed and they said that it had water damage to it and could not be fixed! :-(,1
Both the phones where in nearly new condition. However few days latter battery of one of the phone become like balloon and braking most of the internal parts. the front glass came out etc..,4
I was fooled by the item description. It was totally below expectations. I could not even use the phone. Seems that they were just trying to place a broken phone to innocent buyers...,1
False advertising . It was stating the phone was factory unlocked and I called in to make sure I was getting the product as advertise the customer service rep assured me I would received factory unlocked phones and it doesn't seems like no 3rd party people wanted to touch the phones to try and unlocked them.,1
"Phone came with screen popped out, but still working, and a scratch on the back. A day later, the phone screen was completely popped out. Sending it back as soon as possible.",1
"aside from the usual wear and tear scratches, all works just fine, its awesome!! and it got here on time soooo goooddd!!!! thanks for being trustworthy...definitely buying with you in future",5
"Though the phone came packaged in a box and bubble wrapping, the upkeep of the phone was worn and scratched up.All of the open sockets had dirt in them.I was disappointed with the purchase.",2
We got this for our 15 year old for Christmas--his first phone. He's as happy as a clam and so are we. My only complaint against the iPhone is that the battery can't be replaced by ordinary humans. But it does good stuff and it always works.,5
"the iphone was as described it was excellent i`m trying to unlock it`s off contract AT&T , really good iphonethis seller is really good and fast service",5
"Yes, the used iPhone 3GS works the way it should. I actually received two for the price of one. Also, both iPhones works with any SIM card that I putted.",5
"bid for the purchase of an iphone 3gs 16gb, and they sent me was a iphone 3g 16gb with case broken in one corner and locked when the advert says this factory unlocked and it is a 3gs",1
I'm a senior citizen and have been puzzled by many of the newer phones so I started out slow with the I-phone 3G. I knew right away I should have gone all the way and purchased the newest one. It has been so easy to learn. I recommend it to anyone,5
"Item was as described. Like new in the original box and packaging, with plastic protective sheet across screen, immaculate, with headphones and all papers and manual. It works just like my original 3GS (which served me for 5 years). Fantastic!",5
This phone was a replacement used by my daughter.When received she told me the phone wouldn't take andkeep a charge. I was told to put the phone on Airplane modeto charge. It never made a difference.,2
"I ordered the 16GB model, but was sent the 8GB model instead. I contacted them via amazon, but haven't heard back from them since.If I wanted the 8GB model, I would have saved a lot of money and ordered it originally.",1
"I could not tell this phone had ever been used before I got it - it is in perfect shape and it works very well. It is much faster than the 3G, and I also like the white color of the phone.I recommend this for anyone who wants an iPhone but doesn't want to shell out the big bucks for the latest model. Great phone, good deal.",5
Havent had a chance to activate for use yet but i was happy with how it was packaged nicely to prevent any crcks or damages.so this review is mostly for how nicley packaged it was..Thanks!,5
excelentes 100% recomendados el paqueyte llego en el tiempo establecido y en perfecto estado.el cell trabaja perfecta mente y muy contento por la compra,5
"This iPhone is for my colection of iPhones I started and I could not be more pleased. The Iphone3GS was refurbushed, had no problem getting it unlocked by AT&T. The phone does not have a single scratch on it, it looks brand new. Very pleased.",5
"the description was NEW but when we got it, it didn't hold service so I took it to AT&T and the APPLE store and the pulled the serial # and saw the phone was purchased 5 years ago.",1
This phone is a real disappointment. I can not get onto the internet unless I am at an establishment that has WIFI. So this phone is useless to me. Now I have to buy another phone that is in working condition this is the first time I have ever had a problem buying a phone on Amazon.,1
"good service, fast delivery. I didn't arrange appearance of iphone 3gs received by me, namely attritions, scratches, chips and cracks. In the description them it wasn't mentioned",3
"good afternoon, teams are locked and the aspect that is depressing arrived .. there is one that is estillado everything back sulphate is apparently the battery. quisera know we can do about it.",1
I brought as NEW and UNLOCKED for Christmas gift for my mom. It lasts not even a month. Completed OFF! We lost great memories of my newborn baby . I just came from one local apple store and they said that the phone is NOT UNLOCKED AND IT IS NOT NEW either. It cannot be fix because is missing some pieces. - I am very disappoited and sad.,1
"The cell works well, however for some reason the charging is a problem. I have to charge while cell is off and it doesn't always work. I have to turn cell off and on several times before it will actually charge. I don't recommend this cell, their are so many more better cells than this one. Keep shopping.",2
"First of all the phone was not an iPhone 3GS , it is an iphone 3G instead.#2 I could not activate it for some reason by connecting it with iTunes , I've tried dozens of time unsuccessfullyDon't trust this buyer , all they care about is getting customers money",1
Horrible reception. Poor GPS connectivity. Poor GPS accuracy. Constantly loses signal even when outside in a good coverage are. Overall poor phone quality. Although apps work great and makes for a great iPod.,1
"Using for a digital music device in my car. Great idea and no complaints about the product itself. It works fine. However, the way the seller packaged it (with no wrapping between device and inside of envelope), I had to clean a lot of sticky adhesive from the envelope out of the headphone jack before I could use it.",4
"Came as described, Works perfectly & seller even gave a charger and ear buds so I'm happy with that and also I'm using the device already to leave this review :)",5
I bought this phone for my daughter to enable me to keep in contact with a child who has recently moved out of the house but had lost her phone. She seems to be pleased with some of the newer features.,4
"Purchased from Wireless Warehouse, as a gift. It came exactly as described, arrived promptly and in good condition. Hard telling what exactly ""reconditioned"" consisted of, other than not in factory Jewel Box. Hoping a new battery?It came charged, fired right up and easily replaced an older dying 3GS. Time will tell, but so far so good.",5
Horrible . This was the worst iPhone I've ever bought . I couldn't even connect to MY wifi in the set up . Total waste of money ! The screen was shattered and I couldn't even get past the set up . Don't waste your time with this seller ! Just buy an iPhone 5s at Walmart on Straighttalk for $199 !,1
purchased this phone from Ross Cellular via Amazon last May. Has had problems for a couple of months now and is officially broken now. Do not recommend.,1
Don't like it period it took forever to get to me and when I did get it I don't like it it was all messed up when I put my sim in it it did not even register I took it ad throw it out,1
"The iPhone was fine. It works and is in good condition but one major thing was wrong with this product!!It was categorized under 'unlocked phones' but when I received it, it was clear that it was LOCKED! I had so much trouble with this phone and to sell a product that is different from the description on such a crucial feature is very very WRONG!",1
"Will never buy anything again. I received it and did not work. Neither one of them. Then returned them both and they received it. Never got my refund of 89.00 back, like they said it would happen.",1
"i got the phone and it's missing the tray to insert a sim card... it's useless the plus side it looks like it used to belong to a woman and she had ""nice"" pictures",2
"The company is lightening quick with shipping and customer service.The only negative issue I've had with this phone is that the battery life is too short. Otherwise, the phone is wonderful and the browser speed is amazing. Great phone, lousy battery life. Not a bad deal at all.",4
they come in ok condition ! but for the price you can complain !! its actually better than good but not very good cosmetic !! always buy from amazon and not 3rd party sellers !,5
"I would have given it a higher rating, but I had to get a SIM card Holder installed on the Phone. Other than that the phone seems to be working fine. Phone is in very good condition and was well packaged.",4
"The phone is in great condition. no scratches , no acting funny , just the cord charger that came with the phone wont charge it. The box works just not the cord. I'm not happy with the charger not working but overall its been good !",3
Quality was as advertised. An unlock is required before you can use your own SIM. There were no significant scratches and the product was up to standards.,5
the iphone 3gs is okay. the battery does not last long. i have to constancely keep it charged. i did receive the phone in a timely manner and the condition was good.,3
"I bought this iPhone to replace my old HTC Inspire but all i wound up with was an iPhone that shuts off randomly during use such as my phone calls, or texting so if you want to buy this phone I would reconsider if I were you.",2
Phone doesn't charge. When it is plugged in it is stuck in a loop. Tried to do recovery through iTunes app on computer and it failed before it even began. Worthless junk.,1
This has been a disspointment. After a few months of usage the phone is not working well and giving problems. Sometimes it boots and other it doesn't. If you buy from this seller you are risking to have the phone go bad in a few weeks.,2
The touch feature would not work properly. Had to turn it sideways to get keys to work. Many times couldn’t even turn phone on to answer calls. Finally fixed it. Threw it on the floor and got another phone. No one else will have to deal with it.,1
"I'm happy with the purchase came one month here in Brazil however, I did not realized that the device is locked, so I can not insert my sim card here in Brazil, but I'll try to unlock, and if anyone knows how to unlock for use in Brazil by please help me thank you",5
I am very disappointed as I ordered an Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB (Black) however received a 3g with model number A1241. All the packaging said that it was a 3gs however the phone itself is a 3g. This is made worse as I am living and working In Africa and had a friend bring it over when he visited.,2
Only after one month the IPhone would no longer charge properly. I have to reset the phone every time I need to charge it. And the charge cord lasted half as long before it fell apart. Over all I love the phone and it was like new when it came in. Highly satisfied.,4
"Label on the box included the correct description, Iphone 3gs 16 gb black, however the phone included was a 3g 8gb black in good conditions.Price was good an item was in good condition, included usb cable, wall charger and earphones.Phone was not unlocked.",3
horrible. it doesn't even work. no charger and little description about what is in the box of my package. the user only took a picture on the back instead of the screen. i knew something was fishy. don't even know how to return it to get my money back!!!,1
"This phone is locked, and thats really a bad way to do business by displaying another label.I cannot afford to come back to US to send it back but I think this would serve as a reminder",1
I look for an unlocked iphone and this was not. The article said iphone 3gs yet sent me an iphone 3g and I did not pay for it .... this is not right and it is wrong because it is a deception.,1
"we had a lot of problems with this iphone from the beginingafter 3 weeks screen went blank could not use it, I sent it back to the vendor, hope i get my money back...",1
I used it for a long time until my friend sold me his iPhone 4. Now my sister is using my old 3GS. She absolutely loves it. It came in perfect condition and was fast! I still wouldn't trade the 4 for the 3G but I loved the 3G non-the-less.,4
"Have had issues with ""no service"" several times, so far made 3 trips to AT and T.Replaced sim card and does not hold charge well. We keep hoping the issues will stop, still not sure if we will keep or return.",3
"The phone appeared to be in good condition, but it is defective. It's difficult to hear. I thought it was the plastic over the phone but it wasn't & didn't realize it until a few weeks after i purchased the phone.",1
First off i put in my sim card and it wouldn't read it for like a whole night. it kept saying searching but wouldn't read it. When it finally read it the problem was it kept turning off randomly even though i was at 70% . Waste of $190,1
"Phone condition was like new every button works good also arrived in good time,as indicated,I would recommend buying this phone,at this price compared too!!!",5
"Had to take it to an apple store to get it to work. They said it was so bad inside I should trade it in.So it cost me to get it fixed big time. It was sold as refurbished, had to be a bold face lie.It's a wonderful product but the seller grossley misrepresented it. Refurbished means it works right?",1
"I am very disappointed with this product. not because of physical appearance or whatever, but because of lack of arrival. It was supposed to get here by the 23rd of December, but I still haven't gotten it at the start of 2014. I wish I could give zero stars.",1
"Worked good for one year it lasted and then it showed that what it means to buy a refurbished product! Isn't this what is always expected with refurbished products. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.",1
"Product was exactly as described. There were no dents. The housing reflected only light wear and tear and the screen itself was flawless. The quality of customer service fell a bit short of 100%. Otherwise, my rating would have another star. From now on, I will stick to purchasing all accessories from the Apple store.",3
"Works well except for the battery which doesn't hold a charge well. Loses power much more quickly than other 3GS units I've owned. Shuts off with ~15% left. Yes, i calibrate the battery regularly. It doesnt help. Based on its shaky battery life and power quirks, I don't think this phone will be working much longer, so I feel a bit cheated.",3
IPhone 3gs is a solid smartphone. It is relatively light and compact. It has a premium feel and it is just beautiful. The battery lasts all day long on reasonably heavy used with screen brightness at 70-80 per cent. Call quality is solid and antenna reception is consistent.,5
"The phone had pretty heavy scratches on the front and back, plus the back part was all cracked! The phone restarts itself all the time and the battery lasts 2 hous top! I bought it from Amazon Warehouse and definitely would NOT buy it again.",1

I needed to replace my iPhone 3GS since it wouldn't recognize the charger & my computer wouldn't recognize the phone when plugged into it for downloads. This phone is bettter than the one I got from AT&T!!!,5
"Overall, I changed my mind. While the phone wasn't as described, it's not bad at all. I do still have to clean it up a bit from the adhesive, but it's not a big deal, especially for such a low price. Customer service was excellent. The problem was resolved with a partial refund for it's condition, and I'm happy with that.",4
The iPhone 3GS 16gb I bought arrived in good condition and the phone look brand new. This is the trustworthy every person should have when buying a product got my product from ctphone. Gladly to do business and everyone should too. Great value and prices too. Excellent job.-Ashley,5
"This phone broke within a week. Not a great item. The whole screen just cracked because when I received it in the mail and when I opened it, it had a small crack onto it cause it wasn't packaged the right way",1
"Yes, the used iPhone 3GS works the way it should. I actually received two for the price of one. Also, both iPhones works with any SIM card that I putted.",5
"bid for the purchase of an iphone 3gs 16gb, and they sent me was a iphone 3g 16gb with case broken in one corner and locked when the advert says this factory unlocked and it is a 3gs",1
I'm a senior citizen and have been puzzled by many of the newer phones so I started out slow with the I-phone 3G. I knew right away I should have gone all the way and purchased the newest one. It has been so easy to learn. I recommend it to anyone,5
"Item was as described. Like new in the original box and packaging, with plastic protective sheet across screen, immaculate, with headphones and all papers and manual. It works just like my original 3GS (which served me for 5 years). Fantastic!",5
This phone was a replacement used by my daughter.When received she told me the phone wouldn't take andkeep a charge. I was told to put the phone on Airplane modeto charge. It never made a difference.,2
"I ordered the 16GB model, but was sent the 8GB model instead. I contacted them via amazon, but haven't heard back from them since.If I wanted the 8GB model, I would have saved a lot of money and ordered it originally.",1
"phone works just fine, just don't drop it from any, and i mean any, height without a protective cover on it first. Dropped mine from 1 foot on to tile and the case cracked apart at the front and back seam.",3
"I didnt want to spend hundreds of dollars on an IOS device for my 13 year old. This iPhone does everything the latest touch will do-almost. If she is responsible enough and can take care of this, then we will move up.",5
its automatically turns off . i tried to charge but its still doing. every day its turning automatially and does not turns on.. i wait that 15 minut.. :(,2
I ordered this phone for my husband and it would not work in the mountains in southeastern Oklahoma where we live and I still have it can I send it back with case and glass jprotectors,1
"never worked. didn't ring, dropped numbers. I hated it but couldn't afford to change to a different smart phone. My husband finally convinced me to get a dumb phone and stop being so upset by a piece of junk",1
"My iPhone works like new. It looks better than the description. Phone was unlocked, and ready to use! I love it. & I got it for a great price!!! I recommend it.",5
"I Just received the product, but i am really unable to know if it is working. The SIM CARD TRAY is missing. I can not insert the SIM CARD.Amazon adressed the issue ok so far.",3
"works very well, for the most part, but its unlocked so it took a little effort to get picture messaging to work and after every 5-7 texts or every phone call, I have to turn it off and back on to get signal.",4
love the seller for selling it so cheap bets thing about it it was factory unlocked but what really special what that it had the old bootrom which meant i could have a untethered jailbreak on ios 6.0.1 came with everything except the cables and charger.,5
"product was blocked, the serial number of the box does not match with serial number of thephone, the ear-phone was not original. The product was manufactured in 2010.The product was returned and already refunded",1
It's exactly what we expected. Works great and was in the condition it was supposed to be in according to the ad. This item was part of a customer service adjustment from Amazon due to an earlier order problem.,5
"Hello. I order you white phone. But you sent me black one. Can you tell me what happend. if u dont help me I will hate you.........I,m waiting your answer.sisinserly levani.............",1
The phone came in its original box together with all its accessories: no scratches or dents. The phone looks as though it were brand new. It was on IOS 5 and the baseband was an unlockable one. I eventually managed to get an unlocked baseband on 6.0.1 without much trouble. Great purchase!,5
"So it's not the newest phone out there, so what. This phone was cheaper than getting an iPod of same GB size. It's an apple product so good support, good apps.",5
"Product in good condition but incomplete, because i miss miss accessories had the doubt if so go on and buy it had bought a better one because i had to make additional spending",1
got just like they said and im happy with it however it was missing the on/off switch cover and I had to have that repaired but my otter box cover is the only thing that keeps it in place- phone looks and works fine but I was a tad disappointed with the missing part,4
I bought this phone for my son & he loves it especially it's being his first iPhone. Great product at a great price. Item arrived at the time it said it would,5
On the description for the iphone It said it didnt work but could be fixed but it wasnt coming on and you didnt drop it or do anything to it! but i took it to the shop to be fixed and they said that it had water damage to it and could not be fixed! :-(,1
Both the phones where in nearly new condition. However few days latter battery of one of the phone become like balloon and braking most of the internal parts. the front glass came out etc..,4
I was fooled by the item description. It was totally below expectations. I could not even use the phone. Seems that they were just trying to place a broken phone to innocent buyers...,1
"Phone came with screen popped out, but still working, and a scratch on the back. A day later, the phone screen was completely popped out. Sending it back as soon as possible.",1
"aside from the usual wear and tear scratches, all works just fine, its awesome!! and it got here on time soooo goooddd!!!! thanks for being trustworthy...definitely buying with you in future",5
"Though the phone came packaged in a box and bubble wrapping, the upkeep of the phone was worn and scratched up.All of the open sockets had dirt in them.I was disappointed with the purchase.",2
We got this for our 15 year old for Christmas--his first phone. He's as happy as a clam and so are we. My only complaint against the iPhone is that the battery can't be replaced by ordinary humans. But it does good stuff and it always works.,5
"the iphone was as described it was excellent i`m trying to unlock it`s off contract AT&T , really good iphonethis seller is really good and fast service",5
This phone was in excellent condition and it was shipped fast. It was the best deal we could find on the older 3G model and I needed one fast because mine bit the dust.,5
"I bought this phone for my son as a tester to see how he would do with an ""expensive"" phone. It was cheap and worked just fine. It is obviously slower than the newer iPhones, but I wasn't ready to purchase one of those for my son just yet.",4
"The phone cuts off at65 percent, the camera doesn't work. I'm very disappointed in the phone. It's supposed to be a phone in good condition, it's not!",1
Seems to be as described and in great condition! Arrived on time But without promised case and the sync cord was super cheap but I didn't really buy it for that purpose. The phone is very good and that is certainly what counts!,4
"I could not tell this phone had ever been used before I got it - it is in perfect shape and it works very well. It is much faster than the 3G, and I also like the white color of the phone.I recommend this for anyone who wants an iPhone but doesn't want to shell out the big bucks for the latest model. Great phone, good deal.",5
Havent had a chance to activate for use yet but i was happy with how it was packaged nicely to prevent any crcks or damages.so this review is mostly for how nicley packaged it was..Thanks!,5
excelentes 100% recomendados el paqueyte llego en el tiempo establecido y en perfecto estado.el cell trabaja perfecta mente y muy contento por la compra,5
"This iPhone is for my colection of iPhones I started and I could not be more pleased. The Iphone3GS was refurbushed, had no problem getting it unlocked by AT&T. The phone does not have a single scratch on it, it looks brand new. Very pleased.",5
"the description was NEW but when we got it, it didn't hold service so I took it to AT&T and the APPLE store and the pulled the serial # and saw the phone was purchased 5 years ago.",1
This phone is a real disappointment. I can not get onto the internet unless I am at an establishment that has WIFI. So this phone is useless to me. Now I have to buy another phone that is in working condition this is the first time I have ever had a problem buying a phone on Amazon.,1
"It said in the description stating that it was in great condition with only a few minor scratches. I understood that and was fine with that. But, what I also got was a battery that is expanding so much that its cracking the phone. The battery is so expanded that it wont keep a charge or even stay powered on. Cant even use the phone",1
Phone can in good/great condition however u can't use it without a SIM card. I brought it for my son for music n couldn't use it with get caught up in some contact with my carrier. Kinda a waste of money,2
False advertising . It was stating the phone was factory unlocked and I called in to make sure I was getting the product as advertise the customer service rep assured me I would received factory unlocked phones and it doesn't seems like no 3rd party people wanted to touch the phones to try and unlocked them.,1
Horrible . This was the worst iPhone I've ever bought . I couldn't even connect to MY wifi in the set up . Total waste of money ! The screen was shattered and I couldn't even get past the set up . Don't waste your time with this seller ! Just buy an iPhone 5s at Walmart on Straighttalk for $199 !,1
purchased this phone from Ross Cellular via Amazon last May. Has had problems for a couple of months now and is officially broken now. Do not recommend.,1
Don't like it period it took forever to get to me and when I did get it I don't like it it was all messed up when I put my sim in it it did not even register I took it ad throw it out,1
"I am very disappointed with this product. not because of physical appearance or whatever, but because of lack of arrival. It was supposed to get here by the 23rd of December, but I still haven't gotten it at the start of 2014. I wish I could give zero stars.",1

It doesnt help. Based on its shaky battery life and power quirks, I don't think this phone will be working much longer, so I feel a bit cheated.",3
IPhone 3gs is a solid smartphone. It is relatively light and compact. It has a premium feel and it is just beautiful. The battery lasts all day long on reasonably heavy used with screen brightness at 70-80 per cent. Call quality is solid and antenna reception is consistent.,5
"The phone had pretty heavy scratches on the front and back, plus the back part was all cracked! The phone restarts itself all the time and the battery lasts 2 hous top! I bought it from Amazon Warehouse and definitely would NOT buy it again.",1
I look for an unlocked iphone and this was not. The article said iphone 3gs yet sent me an iphone 3g and I did not pay for it .... this is not right and it is wrong because it is a deception.,1
"we had a lot of problems with this iphone from the beginingafter 3 weeks screen went blank could not use it, I sent it back to the vendor, hope i get my money back...",1
I used it for a long time until my friend sold me his iPhone 4. Now my sister is using my old 3GS. She absolutely loves it. It came in perfect condition and was fast! I still wouldn't trade the 4 for the 3G but I loved the 3G non-the-less.,4
"Have had issues with ""no service"" several times, so far made 3 trips to AT and T.Replaced sim card and does not hold charge well. We keep hoping the issues will stop, still not sure if we will keep or return.",3
"The phone appeared to be in good condition, but it is defective. It's difficult to hear. I thought it was the plastic over the phone but it wasn't & didn't realize it until a few weeks after i purchased the phone.",1
First off i put in my sim card and it wouldn't read it for like a whole night. it kept saying searching but wouldn't read it. When it finally read it the problem was it kept turning off randomly even though i was at 70% . Waste of $190,1
"never worked. didn't ring, dropped numbers. I hated it but couldn't afford to change to a different smart phone. My husband finally convinced me to get a dumb phone and stop being so upset by a piece of junk",1
"Phone condition was like new every button works good also arrived in good time,as indicated,I would recommend buying this phone,at this price compared too!!!",5

they come in ok condition ! but for the price you can complain !! its actually better than good but not very good cosmetic !! always buy from amazon and not 3rd party sellers !,5
"I would have given it a higher rating, but I had to get a SIM card Holder installed on the Phone. Other than that the phone seems to be working fine. Phone is in very good condition and was well packaged.",4
"The phone is in great condition. no scratches , no acting funny , just the cord charger that came with the phone wont charge it. The box works just not the cord. I'm not happy with the charger not working but overall its been good !",3
Quality was as advertised. An unlock is required before you can use your own SIM. There were no significant scratches and the product was up to standards.,5
the iphone 3gs is okay. the battery does not last long. i have to constancely keep it charged. i did receive the phone in a timely manner and the condition was good.,3
"Using for a digital music device in my car. Great idea and no complaints about the product itself. It works fine. However, the way the seller packaged it (with no wrapping between device and inside of envelope), I had to clean a lot of sticky adhesive from the envelope out of the headphone jack before I could use it.",4
"Came as described, Works perfectly & seller even gave a charger and ear buds so I'm happy with that and also I'm using the device already to leave this review :)",5
I bought this phone for my daughter to enable me to keep in contact with a child who has recently moved out of the house but had lost her phone. She seems to be pleased with some of the newer features.,4
"Purchased from Wireless Warehouse, as a gift. It came exactly as described, arrived promptly and in good condition. Hard telling what exactly ""reconditioned"" consisted of, other than not in factory Jewel Box. Hoping a new battery?It came charged, fired right up and easily replaced an older dying 3GS. Time will tell, but so far so good.",5
"The company is lightening quick with shipping and customer service.The only negative issue I've had with this phone is that the battery life is too short. Otherwise, the phone is wonderful and the browser speed is amazing. Great phone, lousy battery life. Not a bad deal at all.",4
"Phone came with screen popped out, but still working, and a scratch on the back. A day later, the phone screen was completely popped out. Sending it back as soon as possible.",1

"The cell works well, however for some reason the charging is a problem. I have to charge while cell is off and it doesn't always work. I have to turn cell off and on several times before it will actually charge. I don't recommend this cell, their are so many more better cells than this one. Keep shopping.",2
"First of all the phone was not an iPhone 3GS , it is an iphone 3G instead.#2 I could not activate it for some reason by connecting it with iTunes , I've tried dozens of time unsuccessfullyDon't trust this buyer , all they care about is getting customers money",1
Horrible reception. Poor GPS connectivity. Poor GPS accuracy. Constantly loses signal even when outside in a good coverage are. Overall poor phone quality. Although apps work great and makes for a great iPod.,1

I am very disappointed as I ordered an Apple iPhone 3GS 16GB (Black) however received a 3g with model number A1241. All the packaging said that it was a 3gs however the phone itself is a 3g. This is made worse as I am living and working In Africa and had a friend bring it over when he visited.,2
Only after one month the IPhone would no longer charge properly. I have to reset the phone every time I need to charge it. And the charge cord lasted half as long before it fell apart. Over all I love the phone and it was like new when it came in. Highly satisfied.,4
"Label on the box included the correct description, Iphone 3gs 16 gb black, however the phone included was a 3g 8gb black in good conditions.Price was good an item was in good condition, included usb cable, wall charger and earphones.Phone was not unlocked.",3

"Worked good for one year it lasted and then it showed that what it means to buy a refurbished product! Isn't this what is always expected with refurbished products. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.",1
"Product was exactly as described. There were no dents. The housing reflected only light wear and tear and the screen itself was flawless. The quality of customer service fell a bit short of 100%. Otherwise, my rating would have another star. From now on, I will stick to purchasing all accessories from the Apple store.",3
"Works well except for the battery which doesn't hold a charge well. Loses power much more quickly than other 3GS units I've owned. Shuts off with ~15% left. Yes, i calibrate the battery regularly. It doesnt help. Based on its shaky battery life and power quirks, I don't think this phone will be working much longer, so I feel a bit cheated.",3
IPhone 3gs is a solid smartphone. It is relatively light and compact. It has a premium feel and it is just beautiful. The battery lasts all day long on reasonably heavy used with screen brightness at 70-80 per cent. Call quality is solid and antenna reception is consistent.,5
"The phone had pretty heavy scratches on the front and back, plus the back part was all cracked! The phone restarts itself all the time and the battery lasts 2 hous top! I bought it from Amazon Warehouse and definitely would NOT buy it again.",1
"My iPhone works like new. It looks better than the description. Phone was unlocked, and ready to use! I love it. & I got it for a great price!!! I recommend it.",5
"I Just received the product, but i am really unable to know if it is working. The SIM CARD TRAY is missing. I can not insert the SIM CARD.Amazon adressed the issue ok so far.",3
"works very well, for the most part, but its unlocked so it took a little effort to get picture messaging to work and after every 5-7 texts or every phone call, I have to turn it off and back on to get signal.",4
"I bought this iPhone to replace my old HTC Inspire but all i wound up with was an iPhone that shuts off randomly during use such as my phone calls, or texting so if you want to buy this phone I would reconsider if I were you.",2
Phone doesn't charge. When it is plugged in it is stuck in a loop. Tried to do recovery through iTunes app on computer and it failed before it even began. Worthless junk.,1
This has been a disspointment. After a few months of usage the phone is not working well and giving problems. Sometimes it boots and other it doesn't. If you buy from this seller you are risking to have the phone go bad in a few weeks.,2
The touch feature would not work properly. Had to turn it sideways to get keys to work. Many times couldn’t even turn phone on to answer calls. Finally fixed it. Threw it on the floor and got another phone. No one else will have to deal with it.,1
they come in ok condition ! but for the price you can complain !! its actually better than good but not very good cosmetic !! always buy from amazon and not 3rd party sellers !,5
"I would have given it a higher rating, but I had to get a SIM card Holder installed on the Phone. Other than that the phone seems to be working fine. Phone is in very good condition and was well packaged.",4
"The phone is in great condition. no scratches , no acting funny , just the cord charger that came with the phone wont charge it. The box works just not the cord. I'm not happy with the charger not working but overall its been good !",3
Quality was as advertised. An unlock is required before you can use your own SIM. There were no significant scratches and the product was up to standards.,5
the iphone 3gs is okay. the battery does not last long. i have to constancely keep it charged. i did receive the phone in a timely manner and the condition was good.,3
I look for an unlocked iphone and this was not. The article said iphone 3gs yet sent me an iphone 3g and I did not pay for it .... this is not right and it is wrong because it is a deception.,1
"we had a lot of problems with this iphone from the beginingafter 3 weeks screen went blank could not use it, I sent it back to the vendor, hope i get my money back...",1
I used it for a long time until my friend sold me his iPhone 4. Now my sister is using my old 3GS. She absolutely loves it. It came in perfect condition and was fast! I still wouldn't trade the 4 for the 3G but I loved the 3G non-the-less.,4
"Have had issues with ""no service"" several times, so far made 3 trips to AT and T.Replaced sim card and does not hold charge well. We keep hoping the issues will stop, still not sure if we will keep or return.",3
"The phone appeared to be in good condition, but it is defective. It's difficult to hear. I thought it was the plastic over the phone but it wasn't & didn't realize it until a few weeks after i purchased the phone.",1
First off i put in my sim card and it wouldn't read it for like a whole night. it kept saying searching but wouldn't read it. When it finally read it the problem was it kept turning off randomly even though i was at 70% . Waste of $190,1
"When I received the iphone,i found it is fake and inferior product,the back cover is renovated,the receiver has a noise when you have a call,screen light-leaking,in a word,it is a bad iphone.",1
"I received the phone with the ""on"" button missing. I took it into the apple store and they said it was counterfeit and refused to fix it. I contacted the seller but they refused to do anything.",1
"i got this phone as a gift for my nephew i have had iPhone 3gs before so i know how they work , the phone is in mint condition but did not come with a charger, the phone is factory unlocked as promised and did not ship in the amount of time that it should this is also understandable and acceptable once you use the phone for the first time.",5
I have trouble with receiving pictures . had to call my cell phone company and Im still having trouble. Its just wasn't what I expected. I also ordered the plastic cover and I still waiting for it. it now been 3 weeks,1
"I bought it for my 14 years old, great condition exactly as describedI'll always use the seller and recommend to all my friends, great price and fast shipperThank you",5
The item's charger did not work and it seems as though this is a fake or replica iPhone. I will have to take it to the Apple Store to know for sure but I'm unhappy with the product besides the fact that it took over two weeks to get here.,1
"I needed an unlocked 3gs iPhone to use with my T-Mobile account. This phone came in an Apple box, never been used or repaired. I checked out many sites before I settled on this seller and I'm glad I did.",5
"Nice phone, great value, I was looking for an iphone, but didnt want to pay $300 or $400 for a newer version, so I went with this 3gs. It arrived in like new condition with all the features of the iphone for a much more affordable price.",4
"No recomiendo este vendedor, sus equipos son reconstruidos, el mio vino con problemas en la pantalla y estoy en venezuela es dificil que se me repare el daño!!!",1

"The iphone is the same that the seller discribe. Is new, and work perfect.I recomend this product for all people who wants to have an iphone and don't want to pay to much por a cel phone.",5
"A very good price for what you are getting. It's not the best phone out there and it's a little slow, but if you're only looking for a cheap smartphone to talk and text on, this is is the phone for you.",4
"Too good to be true. When I received this phone (fulfilled by Amazon), it looked new. It was sealed. But upon using it, it's obviously refurbished??? It wouldn't read my wi-fi and sim card. Also it keeps shutting off on its own even when it's fully charged. The browser freezes a lot as well. Beware.",1
The phone described as new and it looked like new when it arrived. The home button was not working as new and few other problems and hence checked with apple with the IMEA. They clearly confirmed its a refurbished phone. So disappointed.,1
Love this phone. it arrived exactly as described and was factory unlocked and not at all jail broken (like my other phone from a cellular service provider). I could set up our new phone plan in about 10 minutes and it is fully up to date! I will recommend this seller to every one I know.Thanks again!,5
"I bought this phone to replace one exactly like it since my started having problems. I was so excited when I received it; however, it will not import my contacts, capital letters do not work when you push the arrow key and will not even find my carrier. I am so disappointed in this particular purchase.",1
"I ordered two ""New"" iPhones, what i received were refurbished phones. I was planning to gift it but.....Now I visited apple outlet and bought tow ""New"" iPhone 4s...",1
got it last month and it doesnt work any more ... i just cant tur it on .. when i connect it to the wall charger it turns on for a while and after a minute or two or if i unpluge it it dies ----- please need help if anybody knows how to fix it //// im in argentina and theres no apple store here..,1
"Item had some dents and very visible wear, was not ""New"" as described in the listing, that is incredible for the price that I pay! i go to return this item!",1

"Got this phone for my parents Christmas gift. The home button spoiled in two days, can't use the phone because you can't come out of the last App. Unfortunately I'm not able to return the phone. Don't buy!",1
"Phone was exactly what was described. Great shape, brand new. Not a scratch. Much more affordable than getting a newer iPhone, or a two year service contract.",5
"The unlocked 3GS is a great phone. The remarkable thing is that there was no programming involved whatsoever when I put in my Simple Mobile (T-Mobile) chip. Calls, texts and internet work fine right from the get-go.",5
"I love my new iPhone. It's just like an iPod except that I can make phone calls with it. Unfortunately, the charger didn't work and I had to use my iPod charger to charge the phone. I like the fact that it's unlocked because I can use it when I travel to Europe.",4

"The phone came quickly and met all of my expectations. After a month, it has worked flawlessly and done everything I needed. Good seller and good product!",5
"Why is it so difficult for the vendor to provide a product as specified on Amzn? This product was not factory unlocked and my T-Mobile SIM card did not get any signal on this phone, whereas it got a full signal on my Google phone.",1
Nothing better you can get for the price and the appearance. I really would recommend to anyone looking for a smartphone to test drive an older iphone first to see how they like it. It's a cheaper test run and it's fully functional. I would recommend this to anyone,5
Love the phone and got a great price for it. Good for anyone who's looking for a nice cheap and useful smartphone for everyday use. Using for the tmobile line. works great,5
"This phone is just as the seller describe it, it works very well. Only complaint is, it does not have the volume that our old phone did. But of course this is not the sellers fault.",4

cheap reliable phone.This for a friend that needed a spare phone. apple is always better than Android. phone arrived with zero scratches. better than I expected. was unlocked as promised and according to my friend it was so easy to start using. he is happy!.,5
All my purchases was always on time and to my expectation. So far I have never had any problem nether with the delivery or with the contact of what I purchased,5
This phone kept coming apart as it was not well assembled. It eventually stopped working after 35 days. The seller promised to replace it but has failed since October 2014 to provide me with a return address 😂😫,1
"I bought a new mobile, but this is not a new mobile. In two month the battery don't function!!!!It's a shame that people cheat. You must say that this mobile is a refurbished.",1
I purchased this item when i was in US and after i came back to my country this home button in the iphone did not work. When i contacted the seller that i m in india he didnt bother to reply me. This is such a bad experience.,1
Have had the phone for less than 18 hours and the stupid thing is continuously restarting and unusable. Returns are a MESS with this seller as well... Don't buy it.,1
"After having a few weeks with the phone, I just was frustrated how badly it worked. It connected to the network but then work shut off for awhile even the wifi would not connect. The battery would die very fast and the headphones was not working. It just was not good at all. Just know what you are buying online before you get it.",1
"Phone was as described, new, in the original box. Phone worked perfectly and easily logged onto our carrier network once we installed the SIM card. Delivery was in reasonable time, if you want a new older style iPhone this is the one for you.",5
I ORDERED THIS PHONE THAT SPECIFICALLY SAYS NEW ON THE DESCRIPTION. ONLY TO RECEIVE A USED PHONE. I WAS TOLD BY THE COMPANY THAT I WOULD GET A NEW PHONE TO COMPENSATE. NEVER GOT THE NEW PHONE AND NEVER HEARD BACK FROM THEM. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.,1
"took this supposedly ""unlocked and new"" iphone to my carrier to be activated and it could not be used as it was a return or something like that. Returned it and got my money back. Bought directly from apple instead. It was more expensive but it was worth it to get a phone that actually works.",1
It was even nicer than anticipated and works great!!! It looked brand new as described. It had all the manufacturer parts included and they were all in mint condition.,5
"got the phone couldn't make it work no matter what I did the damn thing just kept saying ""not able to activate"" I ended up having to buy another Iphone from att and it work just fine.",1
The cellphone wad not unlocked. I tried many times with different sim cards and with tech support and could not unlock it. I wanted to return it today but saw the return window closed yesterday. I will have to file a chargeback.,1
"The phone came sealed and did not have a sign of usage in any way, I Checked up on it with the Apple Store and was told that it was sold to a store here in the US few Years ago and the Warranty on it is Expired, so if you are the kind that take care of your phone, that would be a good choice for you",4
"I wasn't sure if I should buy a used phone online as you know they could potentially have a lot of issues.Got phone, and worked like a charm, I have had it for a while now and have had no issues.",5
"I asked for a iphone 3gs Factory unlocked and sent me a locked iphone 3g, really does not help me in my country.I feel cheated by this supplier PSXPRO.Be careful with this supplier.Finally I will have to pay 40.00 dollars to return the product they mistakenly sent me.Be careful when selecting the supplier when shopping.",1
"The phone is not new! In a new, disgusting smelling body established fee from your old phone, which apparently returned by reason of marriage. Unstable network and in standby mode not received calls. What a disappointment! Moreover, it was a gift! In the end, I throw away 169 dollars.",1
"I have heard a lot about Iphones and have always wanted one but always found the current generation kinda pricey. I bought this as as my trial Iphone and after I charged it up and did some basic settings, I saw why Iphone adherents rave about them. I'm impressed and am already looking to buy a 4G..",5
"I Think I am returning this item, first of all, because they where not clear of the ""New"" phone, that it looks like new but the accesories are not original, and the battery from the phone lasts so little.",2
"i like this stuffs i think when you buy it you gonna love it like i did so only thing is price and shipping, if they fix it, i will be more happy next time.",4
"The phones when delivered to me were in good condition. But when I gifted them to my friends, it was my worst nightmare. They were complaining that the display colors changed to some odd colors. The speakers of these were gone in some time. I would not recommend any one to buy form this seller.",1
iphone arrived quickly completely new along with the headphones and charger.just like it was described in the ad.I am extremely satisfied with this purchase.,5
"The phone is great, unfortunately the charger/cable is not functioning properly. It all appears to be original packaging, but it's hard to tell for sure. Still an awesome phone.",5
"Great phone. I use it instead of iPod, b/c I need multiples in my office and iPods are $199.I just need Pandora and another app. to run music in my officeIt's a little slow and you can't get the latest software, otherwise for the price it's a good phone and I bought 3 of them.",4
"I purchased these 2 iPhone 3GS, but they have the Cydia software on them...which means they are JailBroken and not Factory Unlocked. I purchased 3 phones in all. They look new, but I know they have been jailbroken b/c it won't show my the iOS version on the phone. Hmmmm",2
The Phone is brilliant for the money you are paying. The voice clarity and everything looks good. The only problem is that the headsets are totally waste and had to buy a new one.,4
"I used the iPhone for today's , and i can not hear . The headphones work fine , and also the speaker phone . I asked a phone technician and he said something is wrong with the phone . The problem is that I am in israel with the phone until June 30.What shall I do?Dr David naveh",1
I received the phone not in the original box. Definitely it is not genuine. It stopped working after ten days of really careful use. It does not receive a signal no more. I wish I had not bought it from this supplier. Do not buy it or you would be disappointed.,1
"As the it says, it came factory unlocked, however, it's been the iphone that has died faster among all I have had so far (4). It lasted only 3 months of normal use. I wouldn't recommend it since I have to buy a new one after three months.",3
"After using the phone for two weeks, the home button is not working anymore and when you plugged into the power cable is not charging.A little expensive for a two weeks cell phone.",1
"Don't buy this phone. You will not be able to use it anywhere on this planet. Again, this phone is locked to a specific carrier. I wanted to have another iPhone for my travels. This phone is no use to me. I am happy that I checked it before going on my trip. I am certainly returning it.",1
I got a locked phone when I called they said oh sorry we knew there were problems with it but we sent it anyway. WTF? Now they keep removing my neg post and ask me to re evaluate the sale. Really?,1

I am expecting that it will be shipped soon. I am worried about the experiences and issues posted on the review pages by other customers. I wish mine will be good so far,1
"I use it with my existing pay-as-you-go SIM card and it is perfect! Skype calls with camera (not face time), Netflix, Angry birds, cloud storage, are few of its capabilities.",5

"I was surprised to notice that I still need to have the phone restored before using it. I paid 70 $ to have it restored or ''unlocked'' ( according to the specialist words). The battery is not good, I need to charge twice a day even though I have not used it. I would not recommend anybody to buy it.",2
This is my first smart phone and I'm very pleased! Was able to exchange the phone promptly when the (ear) receiver was not operating. I recommend this seller who was helpful and very receptive.,5

"Why is it so difficult for the vendor to provide a product as specified on Amzn? This product was not factory unlocked and my T-Mobile SIM card did not get any signal on this phone, whereas it got a full signal on my Google phone.",1
Nothing better you can get for the price and the appearance. I really would recommend to anyone looking for a smartphone to test drive an older iphone first to see how they like it. It's a cheaper test run and it's fully functional. I would recommend this to anyone,5
Love the phone and got a great price for it. Good for anyone who's looking for a nice cheap and useful smartphone for everyday use. Using for the tmobile line. works great,5
"Got this phone for my parents Christmas gift. The home button spoiled in two days, can't use the phone because you can't come out of the last App. Unfortunately I'm not able to return the phone. Don't buy!",1
"Phone was exactly what was described. Great shape, brand new. Not a scratch. Much more affordable than getting a newer iPhone, or a two year service contract.",5
The seller had this phone listed as used but in good condition.......the phone was actually in excellent condition. Much better than what I had expected it to look like. Arrived very quickly as well; very pleased with this purchase.,5
I really like it. works good and smooth. I bought it used. both of the were clean and in a very good condition. it came really fast on expedited shipping with a few bucks more. but it is worth the money i paid. I like it.,5
"This is a great phone with a great price. The phone had virtually no scratches. It works well with my T-Mobile sim card. The phone was already updated to iOS 6 when I received it, so I only had to insert my sim to use it.",5
"I had high hopes buying this phone but when it came it was a horrible situation - right away it developed problems. It just plain quit working inside of 3-4 weeks, the only one I give excellent high points to was Amazons return policies!! THANK YOU AMAZON.",1
Thanks but i think ill just stick to my old phone. I do enjoy the games but the phone locked up and i cant get ahold of this france SFR place to fix it. I wont be ordering any more iphones anymore. I do like it its just frozen up and i cant use it atm. Thanks again. I was impressed with the speedy delivery.,4
"We had to send the iPhone back due to it not being compatible with the plan that my daughter had chosen, and the company was great, understanding and very helpful. I would recommend this company for sure!",5
"When I bought I chose it from the new phones option.I ordered a new, unlocked 3gs iPhone. This one won't work properly, I can't even do a restart on iTunes!",2
This item surpassed my expectations. I could not tell that the iPhone was used. I needed an iPhone with the capabilities to support Square credit card reader. Works great and included recharging cable.,5
The item's charger did not work and it seems as though this is a fake or replica iPhone. I will have to take it to the Apple Store to know for sure but I'm unhappy with the product besides the fact that it took over two weeks to get here.,1
The phone described as new and it looked like new when it arrived. The home button was not working as new and few other problems and hence checked with apple with the IMEA. They clearly confirmed its a refurbished phone. So disappointed.,1
Love this phone. it arrived exactly as described and was factory unlocked and not at all jail broken (like my other phone from a cellular service provider). I could set up our new phone plan in about 10 minutes and it is fully up to date! I will recommend this seller to every one I know.Thanks again!,5
"I bought this phone to replace one exactly like it since my started having problems. I was so excited when I received it; however, it will not import my contacts, capital letters do not work when you push the arrow key and will not even find my carrier. I am so disappointed in this particular purchase.",1
"I ordered two ""New"" iPhones, what i received were refurbished phones. I was planning to gift it but.....Now I visited apple outlet and bought tow ""New"" iPhone 4s...",1

"When I received the iphone,i found it is fake and inferior product,the back cover is renovated,the receiver has a noise when you have a call,screen light-leaking,in a word,it is a bad iphone.",1
"I received the phone with the ""on"" button missing. I took it into the apple store and they said it was counterfeit and refused to fix it. I contacted the seller but they refused to do anything.",1
"i got this phone as a gift for my nephew i have had iPhone 3gs before so i know how they work , the phone is in mint condition but did not come with a charger, the phone is factory unlocked as promised and did not ship in the amount of time that it should this is also understandable and acceptable once you use the phone for the first time.",5
I have trouble with receiving pictures . had to call my cell phone company and Im still having trouble. Its just wasn't what I expected. I also ordered the plastic cover and I still waiting for it. it now been 3 weeks,1

"the item was not had been as described, they said in good condition but when i received it has a big scratch at the back and has small crack at the charger port.",3
Love it love it !!! It is exactly what was advertised that I receive at the allotted time I was promised... Took it to AT&T store the transferred all my info except my music to my brand new iPhone 3GS I told all my friends to go to amazon for all their needs*******,5
"it arrived exactly as amazon said it would, the phone was in excellent condition and brand new as far as I could tell and works like a charm ... may not be the newest model but suits my needs to a tee for an excellent price.",5
This phone it was supposed to be brand new and when I receive it I realize the the phone was used the screen was replace and the phone charger had water damage sings so I'm not happy,1
i observed it for a couple of weeks and i found out that every time i have a incoming calls and out going calls the phone is turning off and even the battery icon still in high percentage. i don't know what's wrong with this phone. can i return it and check what's the problem?,1
I ordered this used iphone for my son instead of buying him a ipod. The price was better than that of a new ipod and he can use it on his cell phone plan. The phone came unlocked and as described. He is very happy with it.,5
"This was an AT&T phone with cheap accessories; Apple was spelled as Abble suggesting Middle East as the origin. It was defective; had signal problems, messages didn't go through. However, the seller (24.Hour.Shipping) was nice and issued a refund including return shipping. Thanks.Please, do NOT buy cell phones on the internet!",1

"I had heard so much negative comments about this phone. I asked if Whatsapp works on it, and one said nothing about this phone works. Well, I am here to say I found nothing wrong with this 3GS iPhone. It works perfectly and I'm loading apps like I dont care!!!! Good phone!",5
The phone looks good but cannot tell how it's work because the phone came with little charge and the charger came with it is not working......really disappointed.,2
Although the phone came with no major flaws and appeared to be in working order the phone often shuts off randomly and won't turn back on unless I plug it in which has proven to be a large inconvinience. I probably won't be purchasing from this seller again,2
"Icheaprepair packed very nicely the used iphone which seems to work more than fine. I belive it is ,as advertised, factory unlocked , but couldn't check it with other operators. It came with a silicone shell , and the wall charger. Not headphones but no pb as it is an used phone. I highly recommend them. Many thanks.",5
"After much hesitation regarding purchasing anything electronic on the Internet, I decided to take a shot. Glad I did. This product came exactly as described and worked perfectly. Had to change it from Chineese to English but that's all.",5
"Not interested in the latest technology, it is totally as a brand new factory unlocked iphone 3gs, it has no issues at all, no scratches, it is still working properly ;)",5
It does what they say it'll do. Had a little trouble getting the web to work with Straight Talk but finally a relative who knows a lot more about this stuff than me got it working.,4
Phone worked flawlessly and was brand spanking new is sealed box! Would defiantly recommend to any one in the market for a great FACTORY unlocked iPhone,5

"I had purchased this as a replacement for a 3gs phone that I apparently used as a basketball too often. I had to return it because several features did not work. I subsequently ordered a 4s, an upgrade at a similar price which works fine.",1
I bought one it works only one and have month then the mic does not work . I went to apple store they told me it out of guaranty it sold from apple since 2010 so I just loss my money,1
"This was gift, and I needed an older phone for T-mobile. As the person in question does not have a data plan, he turned off cellular\Data on the phone put in his SIM, and it worked like a champ",5
"The phone has many glitches, including but not limited to:Shutter on camera that will not openCamera does not take and capture photosWiFi does not recognized any familiar networksBattery extremely weak, charge runs out within 3 hours with occasional usageOther than that the phone is great for email,web browsing, Facebook, etc.",2
"Please guys NEVER buy from this saler I was very disappointed when I bought a new iPhone 3 gs from , got some problem and Square Trade told me that it was a refurbished one, it was not new. I will never , never and ever get anything from him again",1
I would take the Apple iPhone 3GS over the Samsung G3...I would recommend to friends and family members....A+ product that has exceeded my expectations.,4
Phone arrived as scheduled. Phone looks new n works well. The info posted was accurate. I put my Tmobile in n it works n it is ready to go for now. No problem. Nice company. Can be trusted.,5
So bought this iPhone 3GS the only thing that sucked was the home button it was had to push deeper glass had some scratches but it was still worked great glass it did not have any glass cracks before had iPod touch 4g do not see much slowness but my power button on iPod touch got stuck so this why i got a iPhone also needed a phone,3

"bought this phone for my husband. Works fine for talk, texting and music. Has had some trouble with the volume going up on it own when listing to music, but for the most part, good phone for the money.",4
I have purchased new i phone 3gs from this wireless provider as a gift to my friend and latter realised its not working.The worst part even if you report this the wireless provider would n't care for replacing the device or refunding your money.Shows 100% functional on the web site --its a lie.,1
i got the phone but it was the wrong one i order and 16 gb but got a 8 gb it was bend new but wrong gb i sent it back and a refund was made nice doing bussness with them,4
"I bought this phone 3 months ago. Initially I didn't use any sim card to use as a Phone, I only used wi fi to access some web sites. Today I took this phone to a pre-paid Phone company to insert a sim card, couldn't activate the phone. The phone has some software problem, can't fix it. Now I'm stuck with it, can't use it, can't return it.",1
"The product was listed as new and was delivered with ring toggle button missing and the back was cracked. Also, the screen (digitizer) looked like it was coming off. No ear buds, no charge cable, no box, nada! Need I say more?",1
"I can download some things and I can take picture messages, but the phone likes to shut itself off whenever I'm doing any of those things for too long (ie more than 7 minutes).",3
"This phone had a technical problem, the ringer menu was always popped-out on the screen and never gone away and when you minimized the volume, the next thing happened, it was automatically turned up to the maximum volume. That's the reason why I've returned it. Glad that I've got a full refund. Thank you.",3
"came with a damaged area inside the screen where the slide to open occurs, won't read 2 new SIM cards, is NOT a new phone, and shows signs of wear. Hope to be able to exchange it because it took 3 weeks to get it and 6 weeks to get the new SIM card in the mail in rural AK, by then expirations occur on returns.",1
"The item arrived on time, it's battery would not accep a charge at first, after leaving it plugged for several hours it finally took a charge, but once fully charged the charge would not last more than a couple hours, had to replace the battery, it works fine now.",3
"The Apple iPhone i purchased had a couple of scratches but nothing really to take notice, otherwise very nice product. I was able to use my Sim card and use my cellular service, once i put it in slot.",4
"Phone works well with T-Mobile.The battery life is not all that great, but over all this is a terrific phone. I would highly recommend it to anyone constantly on the go.",5
Do NOT get this phone! It drops calls constantly. When you end a call it always searches for service and takes several minutes to reconnect to service.Worst customer service by a company that I have experienced. Doesn't listen to your question and is rude when replying to requests.,2
I ordered this used iphone for my son instead of buying him a ipod. The price was better than that of a new ipod and he can use it on his cell phone plan. The phone came unlocked and as described. He is very happy with it.,5
"One of the speakers (right side) is not working, not good support from the seller. Sometimes the phone shut down when using wi-fi, even when battery is above 70%.",2
"I purchased this used and the phone arrived on time . It was unlocked and works well. There were some scratches to the back of the phone but it didn't matter to me, nothing a case or phone skin couldn't solve.",4
Very happy with iPhone3GS. Phone was as described. Works perfectly with Consumer Cellular. Very satisfied customer and would recommend vendor and product to anyone.,5
well i bought this phone online because it was unlocked and i was going out to europe and as soon as i landed in spain i had to waste 50 euros replacing the battery since the phone would shut down if the charge was below 70% and i recieved a call. The guy in applestore Barcelona told me it was refurbished and not new too.,1
"great phone, arrived ontime and as promised. it was just what i needed to travel. accepted the sim and i was able to change sims when i changed countries.",5

"it arrived on time and it looked new. there were minor scratches, but it was clearly stated. the only thing is that on/off button recently jammed. Other than that, I'm satisfied",4
"Its perfect! Really cool device. I like that you don't have to replace the battery. Not too crazy about the whole ITunes thing, Im not big into ITunes. But I love the phone.",5
Not very happy!!!!! I received my iphone in two days which was great but I was not able to activate the phone because it was still attached to another number. The phone came with a charger and earphones but surprisingly the charger did not work....,2
I got This iPhone it works pretty good it took forever too get in my case because the post office sent it on the wrong route but I picked it up today and I ''it I don't like iOS 7 because on my iPod I have iOS 9.1,5
"The seller, DealFisher, labeled the phone as a Sprint phone in the ad, when it is actually a Virgin phone. I was unable to activate it on Sprint and had to return it.",1
"good afternoon, I need to return this phone because I can not use it in my country, or make a change to one that use chip or AT&T would be so kind please contact me to talk about? thanks",3
I was so hesitiant to buy an iphon after reading all the reviews but i made the leap and did it anyway. and i am beyond satisfied. this phone is perfect. best buy i have made,5
"Phone was delivered on time! Brand new as if I bought it from sprint, in the box wrapped with a new charger! Has been working great since we turned it on. My wife is a happy lady she got a phone again we appreciate it!",5
Im very happy with purchase. Phone look brand New. Chatted with sprint online and they verified MEID # and was told it was clean and can be activated. Within a few mins I was able to make calls and more.,5
I bought this from cellular stream and the thing came in the original box and even cellophane wrapped with all the extras!! looks brand new and works great..... so far so good!! Would def recomend this seller and the phone for people who dont need the latest greatest thing out. Thanks Cellular Stream!!,5
"I was a little worried with some of the reviews I read. My phone is great, had no problems activating it. It looks great the only thing is just a little scrape in the bottom.",5
"Bought the iPhone4 as a backup for my family's lost, stolen, broken iPhones.Exactly what I ordered -- no surprises. Very good condition. Works well.Arrived promptly. Would definitely choose this seller again.",5
"Product was great! Could not tell that it was used! Perfect condition with no scratches, scuffs or any marks! Works great and had no issues getting it activated.",5
This iPhone can not be activated in Brazil. Existing technology here is gsm. Therefore cdma technology does not work here. I was very frustrated because I had no information that the iPhone would not work. Just looked for unlocked phones. Did not know you had iPhones that could not be activated in Brazil.,1
"Arrived much faster then expected, no scratches very good condition. Only complaint is that the touch screen does not sense my fingers as well as I would like. Overall good purchase for the price!!!",4
Great phone. It worked with my sprint service and my daughter loves it. It came quickly however the phone was a little dirty. Nothing a qtip couldnt fix. Thanks,4
In the description it said there were a couple scratches and cracks and when I got it it was practically brand new and much better than I expected. It also came a lot earlier than I thought it would,5
"Item seemed to arrive later than what I expected. It showed shipped but was never picked up at warehouse or something. Other than that - phone was immaculate. Battery runs dead quicker than friends with same phone, even after trouble shooting different techniques to make it last longer. I would trust this seller again.",5
The description on the phone was misleading and the phone came with no charges and full of scratches. Still good but description made it sound as if it looks better. I like the phone I bought a case so the scratches are no visible and I'm using it,2
i would most definatly say if your looking for a cheap yet still in style iphone get this one to start with. worked fine no problems arrived quickly phone was in great shape,5
"Seller shipped product quickly and was described as NEW. However, Sprint could not activate the Iphone because it was locked to another account on their network. I wasted hours on the phone with Apple and Sprint customer service as well as driving across town to get this phone to work. I will not order from this seller again!",1
I was really surprised about the quality of a refurbished phone. It was perfect and easy. and inexpensive enough not to waste money on insurance and that process,5
"phone was alright but just one big problem. It says in the description its carrier is sprint only for me to go to the sprint store and hear from them that its carrier is virgin. Basically there is no way i could activate the phone. I had to return it. Maybe i was just unlucky but well ..... what happened , happened.",2
"Phone was in pretty good condition with exception of the microphone not picking up sound very well, as well as the camera being a little blurry. Otherwise I am cry satisfied",3
After receiving the iPhone 4 I called to activate it and the customer service representative told me I could not because it was reported lost or stolen!!!!!,1
My wife lost her iphone and I needed a quick rerplacement. The phone was an earlier model but it was still new in box. This will keep her happy till she qualifies for her new Iphone 5,5
Came with hairline fracture on back of phone probably no flat of the company. Was probably the post office fault and I'm sure they would replace it but ain't nobody got time for that,3
Was a little nervous about buying a phone that wasnt new but it works fine and my daughter loves it. It was easy to change over into her number. Would do it again instead of buying new...,5
Phone was a replacement for a phone that was stolen. Came fast in the mail and the phone works fine. Will order electronics again if needed. Only when backed by Amazon though. I think this was safer.,5
"You are my hero , I love this phone! It was the best graduation gift I could have ever gotten! Shout out to my boyfriend Jacob Wilson for getting this phone for me!<3",5
"When this product was listed as used, I got a little worried. It looks feels and for all intensive purposes is a brand new iPhone. If it was used they sure fooled me. Great deal.",5
When I received my phone my screen was cracked needless to say it wasn't sprint ugh I didn't even attempt to get my money back I knew it would be a damn catch not a good idea,1
This phone came in the condition that was described. I've been using it ever since and it hasn't let me down.... My Sprint service is another story! Overall I'm completely satisfied with the seller and the product!,5
I was a little bit nervous ordering a phone online. I am very satisfied with this purchase. I received the phone in a timely matter and it worked! My concern when ordering was that i would receive a phone that didnt work or that i would have trouble activating the phone. Not the case here.,5
"Thought I ordered a NEW phone according to the product description, however, when I received it, it had someone else's icloud account, photos and phone numbers. I spent a few hours deleting and setting it up with my info and then found that the earpiece speaker doesn't work. Can't hear the person on the other end. Feel a little deceived.",1
Got this phone for my son to keep track of his blood sugar because is type 1 diabetic. Phone had pretty noticeable scartches and few other dents in it. The nice thing is i got it quickly.,2
"Does not support newest or newer iOS. I did not know that when p[purchasing as a replacement for my wife. We are not apple users (this was just the cheapest). She hates it, thus I hate it...",2
"Hassle Free Cell described this product as a Sprint phone, and even the cellophane on the iPhone box had a Sprint label. But after taking it to 2 different Sprint stores and making multiple calls to Sprint tech support, we figured out that it is a Verizon phone--not Sprint. Augh! What a hassle.",1
The phone arrived on time and was clean. Needed it to replace a cracked phone and so glad I ordered this one. Had it for about a month now and there have been no problems.,5
It works perfectly fine & I recieved my iPhone within 5 days of my order. It works great just that i paid $278 for 8g which is dissapointing because it hasn't been a month and my memory is almost done!,4
"I was a little concerned because I had never purchased anything from Amazon but when I got te phone a day or so later, I was pleasantly surprised. It was n it's original packaging and it works great. No complaints here....",4
Great Cell phone mine was like new and the phones body and screen had no scratches at all carrier was sprint but its unlock able.iPhone 4 and 4s is awesome phones to use.,5
My phone came locked. and since i slightly cracked the screen i can't send it back. could someone please unlock this so i can set it up with a carrier. I just spent 100 dollars on a jip. I will not spend anymore money here,1
"The phone itself works great, all buttons work, But the charger that came with the phone was broken. Other than that the phone is in great condition and works very very well. We are pleased with this product.",5
"I was very disappointed. If I didn't have insurance through my service provider, I would have essential bought a paperweight. It never worked right from the beginning. Something internal was broken so I had to get it replaced, which took about 2 weeks. Not to mention driving to the nearest sprint service station 4x, which was about 40 miles away.",1
This was a gift for my granddaughter. The phone continued overheating. she took it to a sprint dealer who was kind enough to replace it since she had insurance on it. It is now working very well.,3
"PHONE WAS NOT IN WORKING CONDITION, IT WAS MIS REPRESENTED.. PHONE DID NOT WORK AT ALL, A WASTE OF A LOT OF MONEY AND NOW NO RETURN, BE WARY OF THIRD PARTY SELLERS ON HERE, PHONE DOES NOT AND NEVER DID WORK WHEN IT WAS RECEIVED , HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE AM VERY UPSET",1
purchased this iPhone for my daughter as a replacement for her stolen one shipping was fast the price was great phone works great i have nothing bad to say,4
I have had this phone for a month now and it is the best phone I have ever had. I have more access to the internet on it and I get tons of cool apps for free. I have enjoyed this phone a lot more than I did my last one.,5
"was very disapointed when i open the box and the phone was ice cold!!!!! not packed right ,it did not come with a charger, it just shows you how some companies are quick to take your money, and throw your item in a box and ship it with such disregard to the paying customer",1
I purchased this phone for my daughter for Christmas. Went to a Sprint store on the day after Christmas to get the phone activated. I was told I could not activate it because it had been reported as a stolen phone in the past. This phone came brand new in the package. I am upset and want my money back.,1
The camera on this phone was foggy from the first day we received it. Could never take pictures with it. Replaced it after a few months with something better,3
"Check to make sure you're getting one connected to the correct network. I received a phone from the sprint prepaid plan instead of regular sprint, and they couldn't connect it. I had to return it.",1
got phone delivery was longer than expected. Phone was unable to hook up girl selling item had contract on it and didnt pay bill so we could not activate the phone. Very disappointing lost alot of business without a phone. will NEVER purchase threw 3 party again.,1
Bought a piece of s*** phone seller did not mention how useless this phone is home button does not work phone acts up on its own very slow!!!! Will never buy from seller again and would not recommend!!,1
"We had ordered phones 3 times, from other sellers and this time was the trick,the phones were new and everything the post represented they worked wonderful with the service we are using and we will use this seller again in the future if the need arises",5
"I ordered this phone as a back up..... but when I needed to connect it discovered that it is only for prepaid sprint plans and therefor completely useless to me, and of course I can not return it any longer. Extremely disappointed in this seller!",1
Got the phone sooner then promised. Didn't have any issues connecting to Sprint. Phone looks almost new. Very satisfied. Was a little worried because it was from a new supplier. Worried for nothing:),5
This product doesn't even cut on and the power button is not even connected to the phone... I paid $154.00 for and this is the phone i get a broken phone. i need my money back or a new phone sent.,1
"Very happy with price and product, I am very happy with this purchase and have bragged to all my friend ..again thanks for getting it to me so fast too. Happy customer",5
"The phone is ok but I has issues such as touchscreen not working properly , I would not recommend buying a use phone its definitely not worth it. Sacrifice and just buy a new phone",1
"I bought this as a replacement for my stolen 4s. I'm not sure if it's because it is a refurb, but it is somewhat slow and gets terrible service compared to my 4s. It was in pretty good physical condition when I got it tho.",3
"Everything works/looks great! Especially for those who have never had an iPhone before. Service quality is also great, everything sounds great.. no static noises in the background.",5
"The phone is a nice one, and looks very sleek and modern. The battery-life is a little shorter than I expected, but everything else exceeded my expectations. The phone is very fast, and it impressed me even though I am a Android fanboy and was quite reluctant on buying this.",5
I contacted the seller a couple of times and had prompt professional service! We got it fast. The serial # on the box didn't match the # in the phones settings so we had a little issues getting it activated but it all panned out!,5
I bought this iphone for my girlfriend and it got shipped to me super fast! It was in perfect condition and also came with screen protectors. She's been using the iphone for a couple months now and has had no problems with it.,5
"I am generally pleased with the purchase and delivery time. In good condition and came with all the parts and had me back in business within a few minutes of delivery. The only draw back is that there seems to be something sticky about one of the icons that makes the mail and other applications stutter sometimes. Other than that, great purchase!",4
The I phone 4 in white is what I bought and I Love it !!! It was packed very well and explained even better!!! It also arrived earlier then expected they are prompt and curtious with excellent prices check them out you will not be dissappointed,5
"My wife and I have been wanting IPhones for a long time. Our Samsung phones bit the dust (pure junk) and we didn't qualify for an upgrade. So I started shopping here and found two new IPhones and cases for less than our service carrier wanted for a single phone. I love Amazon.com, and their sellers!!!",5
"We had a situation where we went to pick up the iPhone at the post office, and the package had been cut open and the phone was missing. Noble Planet was great and they sent us another one, with no cost to us. They truly stand behind their service!",5
This phone came with so many unpaid charges that it is locked and can not be used without paying a large fee. This fact did not appear in the description of the phone. Miss leading info by the seller. I bought this item on good faith and was taken in!,1
"It was what I expected. Nice function and good price comparing to the Sprint retail store.If you do not like to have 2yr contract of i-phone, Definitely this is right for you.",5
"The phone was very clean when I recieved it. Only a few scratches and nicks. I didn't realize it also came with the charger cable, which was really nice. It also had a screen protecter on it as well. The phone works great, I've had no problems yet. Also, I received it on time.",5
"the item came not as soon as I expected, but when received it was fine except had a few flaws here and there registering for my apple id, besides that its ohk :)",4
It Came Early And It Really looks like a new iphone. I would of give it a five star but one of my speakers don't work but other than that it ok I guess,3
The description is listed as a Sprint iPhone4 8 GB . I received a iPhone 4 8GB that was on the verizon network .I will not be purchasing anything again from this seller I was very unsatisfied with this product.,1
"I wish I would have found this from Joyscells BEFORE I started a new contract with a ""Free"" phone. This is like new and was a hundred bucks. I lost the ""Free"" one and was very upset, but this was every bit as nice. Thank you!",5
I ordered this phone and it was on time and everything but my front camera does not work am I able to send this back because it was not in the conditions,2
Good but the home button of the phone have a slight problem as I have to press hard. But surprisingly this order of mine was dilivered very fast we'll before the expected dilivery date thanks again.,4
I had dropped my phone in the water and needed a phone fast and cheap did my get insurance. .. Really good new and does its job well easy to connect and very happy.,5
I purchased the iPhone 4 for my backup phone and so my daughter could have the option to FaceTime me when needed. The only problem was the power button does not work and it wasn't listed as a flaw in the description.,5
Well so far it's been working good I appreciate the great service Amazon.com offers; I enjoyed my purchase and I'm continuing to use it effectively. thank you amazon for helping me reunite with a great phone that works for a reasonable price!(:,4
After dropping my iPhone 4s and destroying the phone I was not eligible for an upgrade for another 6 months. I purchased this iPhone 4 to hold me over until I can purchase the iPhone 6. Low price and fast shipping made this a perfect temporary fix for my problem.,5
"I will not recommend this phone because it took forever to go to the main screen. Also, every time I will scroll down or up it decides it wants to send me somewhere else",1
The screen was replaced already and it cracked way too easy. But other than that I really enjoy having it and it is better than any other phone that I've had.,5
"very nice, everything as wanted! real and serious person! is the one that I asked for, tks very much! nice making bussiness but I want GSm phone not CDMA! JEJE",5
"I am very Happy with the quality of the phone! I purchase for my son who broke his iPhone. So i couldn't spend much.. It did tooked a little longer to receive it, it has a few scratches. But i believe they did mention that on ad. So, so happy with this purchase!",5
Buyers beware when purchasing a refurbished or used model from GottaGettaPhone.I purchased an iPhone 4S and when trying to activate the phone through SprintIt had been flagged as lost or stolen. This prevented me from being able to use the phone.I returned the phone and purchased a new one from the phone company.,1
This was a gift for my granddaughter. She was was absolutely excited about her 1st iphone. She is very satisified with the phoneThis was a great purchase. The phone arrived on schedule and included the accessories that was listed and the condition of the phone was also excellent.,5
"Love it! Works perfect, no scratches on the phone. I got exactly what I was told I would get. I have no complaints. I would definitively recommend this seller.",5
Worst experience ever paid for faster shipping didn't receive it for weeks . One didn't work at all one didn't hold charge to long . Don't fall in like I did,1
I LOVE IT THIS PHONE ITS AMAZING AND ITS AMA ZING AND LOOKS BRAND NEW CAME IN PERFECT BOX WITH CHARGER AND HEAD PHONES I WOULD MOST DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THAT YOU BUY ANYTHING FROM YHIS BUYER!!!!!!,5
"The phone was damaged around the edge and looked like it had been abused. It clearly did not meet the ""used but good"" description. I had to pay to ship it back which shall not be the case when I am not satisfied with my purchase.",1
"It arrived pretty fast, in good condition. The phone works like new, though the charger/usb wasn't working at all, but I didn't bother the seller. As long as the phone works its all good",5
"I was worried about ordering this phone because it was used, but boy was i surprised. The phone came in super fast and looked amazing, no scratches or anything. Love it",5
I really enjoy the IPhone 4. I have only had a few minimal problems with it but nothing significant. It does what I want of it and that is all I need.,4
"The phone took a week to get to me, I thought It was a little too long. When I got it, it came in very flimsy packaging but the phone was in great condition. Was able to activate it and I like it a lot!",5
Ive Been Wanting An iPhone And I Couldnt Find One That Was Like Brand New. My iPhone Shipped FAST & The Phone Was BRAND NEW With Warranty Clean ESN & All. There Was No Problem Getting It Activated Either Im Happy With My Purchase Oh & It Came In Its Box With Charger & Ear Phones Its Worth Every Penny !!! :),5
very disappointed that we have had this product for less than 6 months/ and it came very LATE .. was a xmas gift and it no longer works at all.. Apple said it came with water damage and now you cannot even make a call from it. No longer connects to internet. Basically it is junk.,1
This was billed as a previously owned device but there is no sign of it. I purchased the expedited delivery and had it in 2 days. I know I saved at least $70 over buying the same device from a Sprint store.,5
"The team is not released, I will be able practically no use. In this condition the phone does not work, I think that if they have international alcalcen should do in that particular emphasis",2
"I tried to activate it to my sprint account, they told me it's not a sprint phone so I returned it. I'll give it 2 stars just for the costumer service, since they took it back at no charge for anything.",2
"This was given as a christmas present to my best friend, and low and behold we called to get it connected to her existing sprint account and this phone is already registered to someone else. How embarrassing ,so i had to go and buy a brand new one from the apple store to save face on christmas. what a nightmare!!!!",1
Bad esn. Do not buy. Ruined my kid's Christmas. This was supposed to be a new in the box phone but it could not be activated because the code is already in used.,1
I chose this rating because the phone works great but the charger didnt work at all and on the discription it said it had a charger but it didnt say anything about it being broke.,3
"I love my Iphone alot, I haven't experienced any problems activiating it...It came be for the due date. I'm not looking forward to upgrading it. Its just right.",5
This was my first electronic purchace online. I had some questions during the shipping and my email was answered within 24 hours. When I received the phone it was exactly as it had been descibed on the listing. If I need anything electronic again I will most likely look to see if this company has it first.,5
"This iphone was perfect. Barely had any dents or scatches, it was basically brande new! I would definitely considering ordering from this person again.",5
I bought this for my sixteen year old grandaughter for CHRISTmas; therefore it won't be activated until then. It appears to be in great shape. Delivery was fast and phone was packaged well for shipping. Would recommend.,5
"I purchased this phone brand new, I receive it fast and the next day. It was in the original box still sealed. The phone works great but the charger that came with did not work so I had to go out and buy a new one other than that it was a great phone.",4
"Perfect condition, great phone, case included! The phone is in perfect condition, but I did not recieve a connecter for the wall piece, however I have one!",5
Great phone. Came as promised...no straches! I was a little dissapointed in the shipping. I didn't get it in time for Christmas but I still surprised my husband.,4
Ordered an iPhone 4 for Sprint and got an iPhone 4 for Verizon and can't seem to get a hold of them. Also will not let me file a return. Very frustrated!,1
I was very pleased with the quick turnaround of my order. The phone was exactly as indicated on the website. It works great.I will be sure to pass this information on to others requiring a new/used/refurbished phone.It's nice to know that I don't have to go to a phone store to get a new phone!,5
I was sent a phone that was said to be on the sprint network but I then went to activate it and could not because in fact it was a boost mobile tracfone.,1
"I'm obviously a late bloomer, this is my first iPhone. I have to say that after having a glitchy Android phone, I'm very happy with how user friendly this phone is.",5
I love my iphone from amazon I've had it for a year now but once my contract is up ill be buying a new phone with more memory because 8gb is not enough but that was my fault. But my iphone was wonderful and great shape the seller described it well.,5
"At first, it was really hard to set up and I thought it was stollen. Which had me worried. But the Lady on Sprint said the iphone setup network was down and will take some time. So a few hours after midnight, I did the ritual and, BOOM it works. I love this phone. Easily the best phone I have ever had.",5
the product came at the speed of light. They were fast and the porduct came and fuction as described. I have the pone connected through Sprint with no problem as of now.,4
"I love this phone. It came almost two weeks late, as they had lost my order, but they took care of it and shipped it overnight. The phone is great condition, working and physically. It has a good battery life, I charge it about once every day and a half. The case deterred the photo quality so I bought a different one. Thanks for a great product!",5
"My Phone Came In Within A Few Days. It Didn't Match The Decription, It Actually Was Better Looking & Functioning Than The Description Explained. I Absolutely Love My Phone, & I Recommend Buying Your Phones From Amazon. By The Way, This Wasn't My First Phone I Brought From Here, & It Probably Won't Be My Last.",5
So excited to get it but we have had our I phone 4 for 3 weeks and one speaker is out and the home button sticks. :( but you can't beat the price and the phone looks great. :),3
"I purchased this iphone while I was in the US, when I took it back home with me, I realized it didnt have a sim card holder, and we only use sim cards were im from. I messaged amazon but no reply, so I end up using it only for social networking when I catch wfi.",4
It's a good iPhone there are some scratches on the camera and some on the screen plus it didn't come with any accessories but all in all it was a good buy and I would recommend this seeker if your going to buy an iphone,3
My son broke his original iPhone 4. He cracked the screen. I refuse to buy a new one and buy into another contract. It was much cheaper to find him a used phone from here and this one was in awesome shape. Even came in a box!,5
Needed phone ASAP so paid for expedited shipping...called to activate when it arrived and wasn't able to because it's been reported stolen. Now it will take at least another 2 days before I can have a phone. Very disappointing.,1
"Hey I have no problems with the phone. But i guess one speaker is out, so audio isn't loud enough to hear through conversations... but hey no prob, I'll get a speaker",4
"Came within one week after ordering! Looked brand new, didn't even look used! Don't buy refurbished phones from cell phone providers when you can buy them for half the price from this seller.",5
This phone came in so quickly and didn't have a scratch dent or anything on it that is amazing for a refurbished item it looked brand new! The only downside I had was that it couldn't update to the newest version of ios but that was ok I still could play and download many games!,5
"Phone doesn't charge well, it dies at 80% and its suppose to be a Sprint phone but I had a hard time getting it activated with Sprint. I had to wait 3 days because Sprint had to unlock it.",1
"I loved this phone I was very pleased with how everything was gone about. Still using the phone and dont plan to stop until my plan updates, Loving my phone so much!",5
"I received only a cell phone, I did not get a box, cables or other accessories.The cell phone is broken, in the ad is not warned. In reviewing the ad is not that warning, but on the printed invoice I received if you warn. Now tell me they do not accept returns so I lost my money.",1
The product arrived new as advertisedBut was not sprint capable. The wireless companu was very apologetic and made it easy for me to ship back and they sent me a replacement that is sprint ready and brand new. I would definitely buy from them again.,5
"Was new as described, and had clean Sprint ESN, no problem with activation. It doesn't have much storage but it's generally enough for me. Charges quick and has great battery life.",5
"The phone is great-but it isnt unlocked to go to any carrier-I had to go to sprint...and with a prepaid plan like I wanted, you have to buy a phone! luckily, they have the same phone, and a buy-back program so it worked out. But the phone itself was great,no issues.",3
The iphone arrived quickly and exactly as stated being an refurbished phone. The only issue I have is the battery life is rather short. Other than that it was a great buy and highly recommendable.,4
"Old cheep iphone 4 that I got for my mom as a present. It runs slow now, but she would never realize that, and I don't use it. She has been using it without any problems so far so I'd say good deal. Know what you get though, obviously this is an older model, thus not as fast or updated as any of the more current versions.",4
This phone worked fine for about 5 months and then it quit capturing v-mail messages and would only show text messages sporadically and mostly only when I was at home and in close range of Wi-Fi. I took it to the Apple Store and they said there was nothing they could do and it is no longer in warranty. A total bust!,1
"The battery would die after a full charge in about 40hrs of just setting,blue tooth and locating gps off. Sellers need to test the battery life of these phones.",2
"Hardly any damage, everything worked, but the reaction time can be slow though for when im trying to do stuff on the phone. The left speakers dont work or the charger given didnt work.",5
"Well bought for my wife after she broke her galaxy and wasnt eligable for an upgrade. She complained about the button sticking and the phone dropping calls and the scratdhed up screen, she is allowed to trade with this seller but that woman will die if she is without a phone for another week.",3
"The phone was perfect for the first week. Now it just freezes, doesn't load fast, exits out of apps unexpectedly. It's just a hassle. I'm very disappointed.",2
The phone had a crack in the back and the volume on the phone was very low. When turning up the volume I still unable to hear others people on the phone. Returned to seller and they were gladly to refund my phone.,2
"No, broke after 30 days, was for my college student daughter, who some kljsafdklsadjlk stole her Iphone 6, any advice how to get a good Iphone for cheap that will last for 1 year and 3 months.",1
Useless as a chocolate tea pot. It was a PAYG and sprint flat refused to re activate it. It became a useless brick so had to be returned. Screw Sprint.,1
"Arrived much faster then expected, no scratches very good condition. Only complaint is that the touch screen does not sense my fingers as well as I would like. Overall good purchase for the price!!!",4
Great phone. It worked with my sprint service and my daughter loves it. It came quickly however the phone was a little dirty. Nothing a qtip couldnt fix. Thanks,4
"received the phone quickly, though this says black I received a white one which is just as good reguardless.. nothing wrong with the seller or anything just the phone itself has a few quirks I think is due to maybe the phone company. other then that it is in great condition",4
When i recieved the phone a couples months ago i was very upset because it has a lot of scrathes on the back and a scrape on the metal part i would like a new one i spent too much money for a scratched phone,1
"I would give this zero if I could. I received my ""refurbished iPhone"" and took it to Sprint to have it turned on. Guess what? They will not turn it on because the phone was stolen and is still currently attached to an active Sprint account. They kept the phone to return it to its owner. I doubt I will get my money back.",1
"I based my purchase on the description due to no picture being available. The iPhone works well but, I was disappointed that it has quite some wear to it.",3
In the description it said there were a couple scratches and cracks and when I got it it was practically brand new and much better than I expected. It also came a lot earlier than I thought it would,5
"Item seemed to arrive later than what I expected. It showed shipped but was never picked up at warehouse or something. Other than that - phone was immaculate. Battery runs dead quicker than friends with same phone, even after trouble shooting different techniques to make it last longer. I would trust this seller again.",5
The description on the phone was misleading and the phone came with no charges and full of scratches. Still good but description made it sound as if it looks better. I like the phone I bought a case so the scratches are no visible and I'm using it,2
i would most definatly say if your looking for a cheap yet still in style iphone get this one to start with. worked fine no problems arrived quickly phone was in great shape,5
"Seller shipped product quickly and was described as NEW. However, Sprint could not activate the Iphone because it was locked to another account on their network. I wasted hours on the phone with Apple and Sprint customer service as well as driving across town to get this phone to work. I will not order from this seller again!",1
I was really surprised about the quality of a refurbished phone. It was perfect and easy. and inexpensive enough not to waste money on insurance and that process,5
"My one daughters volume buttons do not work properly, meaning they do not adjust the volume and my other daughters phone she has trouble hearing people and they have trouble hearing her.",3
"My phone stopped working after only 5 months normal used. since it did not come with any warrantee, I was told it costs $150.00 to get a replacement due to phone set system/software issue",2
"it arrived on time and it looked new. there were minor scratches, but it was clearly stated. the only thing is that on/off button recently jammed. Other than that, I'm satisfied",4
"Its perfect! Really cool device. I like that you don't have to replace the battery. Not too crazy about the whole ITunes thing, Im not big into ITunes. But I love the phone.",5
Not very happy!!!!! I received my iphone in two days which was great but I was not able to activate the phone because it was still attached to another number. The phone came with a charger and earphones but surprisingly the charger did not work....,2
"good afternoon, I need to return this phone because I can not use it in my country, or make a change to one that use chip or AT&T would be so kind please contact me to talk about? thanks",3
I was so hesitiant to buy an iphon after reading all the reviews but i made the leap and did it anyway. and i am beyond satisfied. this phone is perfect. best buy i have made,5
"Phone was delivered on time! Brand new as if I bought it from sprint, in the box wrapped with a new charger! Has been working great since we turned it on. My wife is a happy lady she got a phone again we appreciate it!",5
"I was a little worried with some of the reviews I read. My phone is great, had no problems activating it. It looks great the only thing is just a little scrape in the bottom.",5
"Bought the iPhone4 as a backup for my family's lost, stolen, broken iPhones.Exactly what I ordered -- no surprises. Very good condition. Works well.Arrived promptly. Would definitely choose this seller again.",5
"Product was great! Could not tell that it was used! Perfect condition with no scratches, scuffs or any marks! Works great and had no issues getting it activated.",5
This iPhone can not be activated in Brazil. Existing technology here is gsm. Therefore cdma technology does not work here. I was very frustrated because I had no information that the iPhone would not work. Just looked for unlocked phones. Did not know you had iPhones that could not be activated in Brazil.,1
I got This iPhone it works pretty good it took forever too get in my case because the post office sent it on the wrong route but I picked it up today and I ''it I don't like iOS 7 because on my iPod I have iOS 9.1,5
"The seller, DealFisher, labeled the phone as a Sprint phone in the ad, when it is actually a Virgin phone. I was unable to activate it on Sprint and had to return it.",1
Im very happy with purchase. Phone look brand New. Chatted with sprint online and they verified MEID # and was told it was clean and can be activated. Within a few mins I was able to make calls and more.,5
I bought this from cellular stream and the thing came in the original box and even cellophane wrapped with all the extras!! looks brand new and works great..... so far so good!! Would def recomend this seller and the phone for people who dont need the latest greatest thing out. Thanks Cellular Stream!!,5
"This is a nice phone, but it is not net ten ready it can only be serviced through Verizon. I learned that the hard way and bought everything for net ten and spent two days trying to activate it to find out you can only use Verizon .",2
Phone works with network. But old technology does not allow for apps. Phone screen cracked on arrival but not enough to interrupt use. Screen cracks easily and in general phone seems cheap. Great for kids or as inexpensive option if you can't afford newest phones but you get what you pay for,1
Was not for Net10 but was ready for Straight Talk. Also did not come with all the extra stuff which I think I should be either refunded some money or sent the stuff as promised. Awesome phones though in really good condition and got here pretty fast. Me and my girlfriend do enjoy them but the information is wrong.,3
wish I had known BEFORE I got it for my daughter's bday that it can't be activated without a SIM card as it was previously used and owned by AT&T. Ended up having to place another order for a sim card just to get wifi for it and wait another week.,4
"Packaging was good, what it can with was good, but the phone itself I had problems with. I currently have tmobile and the phone is lacking service every now and then, I had s few stops between apple and tmobile, both saying its SIM card. So far havnt figure out a solution",3
"I'm very happy with this purchase, the phone looks like brand new, everything works fine, and the vendor shipped the merchandise fast.So far I did not have any problem with it, A+",5
"Awesome product,perfectly in working condition. Not a single scratch.battery life is awesome too. All of these just for $69.Of course i just got it, ill post a review again in 3 months, fingers crossed.",5
"Poor quality, would not stay charged, no sound I was only able to talk on speaker. Contacted the company it appears they are too busy to assist me with my problem. Amazon very helpful.",1
"I was so happy and excited when I got this phone as a gift from my wife, but I was so disappointed because there was something wrong with the microphone. People couldn't hear me and I had to use the speaker which was awkward because people didn't know why they were on speaker! I eventually returned it and luckily got a refund.",1
"this phone was sold as new worked for 3 mnths then stopped took it to the nearest apple store which was 3 hrs away for them to tell me it was a ""frankinstien"" meaning there were some apple parts an some that were not now NOBODY will help 300$ just gone",1
"It's not bad for the price, but there is lots of glitches in it! Another thing, it says it comes with a charger and it didn't! The only thing good about it is that it came quick!!",2
"This is my first return on Amazon and it appears to be very easy. As far as the product is concerned, its looks great but works terribly. Clearly a defect of some sort...all well, will return and purchase a new one",1
I buy this second hand I phone 4 the looks is great but I'm just disappointed coz it won't work properly something wrong on calling somebody they can't hear me.,3
"i bought i phone 4 and this i phone supposed to be used like new but i surprised when i found the back camera is scratched and not working , really it was very bad",2
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE IPHONE IS UNLOCKED ? I AM FROM VENEZUELA AND ME KNOW IF I WANT MY COUNTRY IS IN GOOD BUY IT NOW SO I HOPE YOUR ANSWER THANK YOU!,5
there were multiple issues with the phone that was supposed to be refurbished. this was the first product I purchased through here that I can say was a waste of money and I order a lot.,1
This is clearly the wrong phone and it would be excellent if whomever repackaged this actually looked at the box which clearly states VERIZON not what it was sold as AT&T. The irony here is these 2 different networks also use different carries AT&T is GSM and Verizon is CDMA. So this phone is a complete fail there too.,1
A family member keeps breaking his phone. I didn't want to buy a brand new one. This re-furbished phone is working great and I couldn't beat the price.,5
"I fine this phone to be very well made, and it's loaded. I had a android phone before my iPhone, if I had to rate the difference I would pick this phone first. This phone is much more sophisticated, but people friendly.",4
"The purchase of this iphone 4 has caused me so much hassle and waste of time. What a total regret buying this phone from ""mobilekarma"" Not only was it sold to me as a blacklisted phone, there's no way to get this iphone off the list. I had contacted mobile karma and they have no means to settling or solving this issue.",1
"This company seems like a joke to me, I got the phone but at least once a week I have to reset it. Like factory reset it. For the money I paid, shipping hassles I had, that is not worht",1
This product arrived in box and with accessories that work! But we paid too much for this phone bc it continuously goes to the reboot screen! We are trying to find out how to fix this problem...but it is difficult!,2
"After spending an addt'l $100 to replace the broken glass, once service was activated, we found out the owner did not remove his personal information and in order for us to do it, we needed his password. After several conversations with the seller, at the end of the day, he would not provide his pass code thus the phone was useless.",1
My son wanted to be iphone nation but I had just switched carriers. So I was not going to pay full price for a new phone. Then I said let me look on Amazon.com. this phone did not have scratch on it. Perfect condition. My son loves it. Thank you. Money well spent.,5
"The iPhone 4 was sold as like new condition, the bottom right corner glass was shattered and the button intermittently works. It cost me $136 to have it repaired",1
Great phone! I would recommend it. It may not be the newest version of the iPhone but they are all the same thing in my view. I replaced my blackberry torch with this one.,5
I am very pleased with this item. The phone arrived within a short period of time. It was in a great shape and the seller even included a nice case and a charger.,5
The phone comes in a box like a brand new iPhone. I thought everything was fine with it but It drops a lot of calls and it freezes every once in awhile.,3
Love it so far. The Home button doesn't work but the seller told me that at the very beginning. The assisted Home button (setting you have to turn on) works great.,4
"The product was a huge disappointment. After a week of use, callers could not hear your voice when you called out on the phone. The only way to use the phone, as a phone, is with headphones. I do not recommend product and did not purchase the product just to be able to text.",2
"Works great, received this phone on the date that was published, but as soon as i got it the battery was not fully charged and the charger was not working so i received a new charger. Now the phone is in great condition.",5
"Great deal, came in time, had it for over a month now, works Perfect just like it should.. I guess I just got lucky this time..:/ but yeah, good sell:)",5
I love the product that was purchased thru amazon. I love the prices the fast delivery and the quality of the phone that I have now. Thank you amazon!! A+,5
We had a question about the iPhone and the dealer got back with us the same day we asked. They explain to us some items about the iPhone and our grandson is very satisfied with his new phone.,5
I received the phone the day before I expected it and the condition was better than expected. But when placing phone calls the person on the other line can not hear you. I constantly breaks up. had to go back to old cell phone and looking to purchase another phone. the two stars are for the shipping time and appearance.,2
"Purchased this product as new. Proximity sensor failed. Apple support told me this phone was purchased in 2011and had no factory warranty. Company will not do any replacement after 30 days, so beware. I have a phone that I cannot use for phone calls. I will not purchase from these people as they state the product is new, but it is not!,",1
Phone was brand new and worked great.. I also recieved it in 2 business days which was awesome because I paid for standard shipping..my only complaint is the price was a little ridiculous for an iPhone 4 so I'm rating the phone a 4,4
"Would of liked a printed booklet of how to set things up.I am senor citizen & need to read something other than on just phone..Had to purchase ""how to book""",3
The phone was in excellent condition and we have had no issues with it. The charger stopped working about a week later. Other than that I have nothing negative to say about our experience.,4
Great phone my son wanted a iPhone so I decided to go with the 4 until I know he can be responsible with it. Came the day it was suppose to unlocked no problem at all.,5
"This is my second one, and is really frustrating because i have to take it too have everything copied. I can hear other people on line, but they can not hear me sometimes.",1
Ordered for my son and he has been pleased with the phone. Bought a case for this one. :)Telephone was in good condition with no scratches. Actually better than the description.,5
"The phone looked to be in perfect shape. However after 2 weeks of use, phone calls seem to have lots of static then would automatically disconnect.Unable to hear or be heard. Very disappointed. In the process of getting a refund. No exchange was offered.",1
"If your an Apple customer you'll love it , just like new , no scratches or appearance of usage .Be sure to have your sim card ready for it ... Comes in box with all accessories needed.",4
Very upset with this product. It says its unlocked using Gevey sim which it is not. The phone i received had too new of a baseband to unlock. Had sratches on back too... Looks like i just bought a $350 paper weight until baseband can be unlocked..... what a SCAM,1
"Freezes a lot, also you can no longer pay to get att network switched to tmoible are vise versa. Very easy to crack, I ended up getting the iPhone 5 after cracking three 4s's in a year, and I'm much more pleased.",3
Beautiful. Best phone I've ever had. Arrived with maybe two scratches. Is eligible for straight talk from Walmart which is a great deal. Never a loss of service. Excellent buy,5
I like the phone but when I call somebody and I can hear them but they can not hear me. That sucks cuz I like to talk to people more than texting. Like I can't call work when I'm going to be late. I would have to text someone who going to work that day so they can say that I going to be late.,2
"I am very happy with my phone. It actually came 2 days earlier than scheduled. It was in excellent working condition. I read a bunch of reviews before I ordered it. I was worried about buying used electronics. Something I never do. But, I'm glad I did. I saved alot of money and That's always a plus!",5
"Worst experience ever , ordered a 32gb , iPhone , they sent one that had serious design issues. They expedited another phone to replace it this time it was an 8gb iPhone , I am extremely disappointed and will be very cautious in the future using them to order items or reccommdnding then to others .",1
"The phone does have some very minor cosmetic damage, you wont see it when the case is on and the home button is a bit stubborn but i'll change that soon.",4
"they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used iphones when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described",5
i love it its great and the pics are great its just want i wanted a great i phone 4 thank u it cane on time that's what i love about the seller was great and on time and i would order from this company again. thank u again,5
The iphone 4 worked pretty good for 15 days but started acting up when I pushed the home button. It has 60% before I went to bed and at some point through the night it died. Very disappointed because this is my business phone.,2
"Even though the iPhone 6 will be out soon, I fell in love with this phone. The processor makes everything super quick, and even though non-market apps are much easier to obtain on an Android, I find that the versatility of the iPhone makes up for it",5
"SHIPPED A 16 GB WITH A FAKE PAPER PRINTED 32 GB LABLE WITH A BARCODE AND A IMEI NUMBER, TOOK IT TO APPLE AND CONFIRMED IT WAS A 16 GB, AND ATT CONFIRMED THE BARCODE WAS NOT THERES AS THEY DO NOT BARCODE THEIR PHONES THEY USE APPLES ORIGONAL, DO NOT BUY!!!",1
Product was in excellent condition. I ordered this to replace the not very user friendly android phone I had been using. I will never have anything but an iPhone from here on out.,5
"The shipping on the phone was fast and timely. The phone works well, but acts slow sometimes. It is missing a screw. Other than those small things everything is cool.",4
IPhone 4 is pretty good.. However many features which are added in ios6 are not available for iPhone4. I don't see any real reason as hardware for many of the features. So little disappointed with that.,4
"THIS PHONE IS EN PERFECT CONDITIONS, ONE THING, THIS PHONE SENT ME WITHOUT A BOX. I DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT EVERYTHING WAS OK, IT'S LIKE NEW. I REALLY LOVE IT",4
"Loving my phone. Was even better with Siri, but I lose her with the upgrade, could hardly wait for the new jailbreak to get her back. I suggest if you intend to sell your phones again take Advantage of the protective covers. Sense this I have gotten a number of items through Amazon",4
"This is very good iPhone . When I bought. I didn't realize that was goodbut I take a chance to buy when I receive it, it was very good and comewith the box and with a complete accessories . I am very satisfy.",5
"It can run the newest iOS. No Siri but I do not much care about that. The disappointment is that is just 3G and does not support 4G. Responds well, has Face Time.",4
I bought this iPhone 2 years ago and I'm still using it it came like the info said and like the pictures I recommend anyone getting iphone 4 go hereI just now figured out the ratings and reviews sorry took so long get backWith everyone,5
This was my first time purchasing a phone on Amazon. Was pleased with the price and selection. Phone works well - have had no problems at all. Will definately use for future purchases,5
"Everything is really good except the battery life does not last very long at all, had an iPhone 4 before this one and battery life was excellent but his one sucks",3
The phone in its self is amazing but the batteries messed up in both it won't stay charged for nothing and then you plug it in and I jumps the percent of the phone up like 10% like its not really dying,2
"Needed a replacement phone for my daughter This one made her very happy! Was received in as advertised condition. Fully functional. No noticeable scratches on screen, original plastic on back, and otterbox works great.",5
"I wrote a previous review about this phone. It was not a 32GB as listed, but a 16GB. It was not unlocked either. After contacting Amazon, they did all that was necessary to correct the problem along with a full upfront refund before receiving the phone back. Thank you to Amazon for their hard work in the customer service department.",5
"Phone is in good condition but the home button doesn't work and there was no mention of that problem on the ad. Apple said they can replace or repair for a bout $140. Quick shipment, no problems other than that.",3
"if you want a 100% functional phone, don't buy this one. the phone arrives like a new, but the home button is not 100% functional. you have to push harder engough to make it work, it is annoying because you use the home button all the time.",2
"I bought one Iphone,supossed to be new, with this seller and the Iphone came broken I took it to a guy to put my sim card in it and the guy told me that the screen had already been changed and that the Iphone already had contact with water. And today my Iphone broke and I can't make calls or receive, I can't access the internet or my messages.",1
The phone looks great but the home button does not work. I immediately contacted the seller and received no acknowledgement of my e-mail. I was able to adjust the settings on the phone to make it function. I am not satisfied with the seller at all.,2
"Awesome referbished phone. I would definitely recommend this to someone who's phone has been broken or stolen and is wanting a replacement iPhone. If you are inelidgible for an upgrade and do not have insurance, this is definitely the cheapest route. Great way of purchasing an iPhone at a discounted price.",5
"Decent phone, about what I expected for a used phone. The battery life isn't as good as I hoped, and the screen is sometimes unresponsive, but overall it's what you ought to expect if you're not buying new.",4
The home button and on button don't work on this item which was not mentioned in the seller notes. Otherwise good purchase. Certainly worth the amount I paid for it.,3
"Couldn't be happier if it was brand new, works great. The camera is really awesome, takes great shots and is really fast with the next ""frame"". I could take 50 pics in 30 seconds with out having to wait like most cell phone cameras. Changing apps is very fast as well.",5
I ordered a black 32gb iphone 4 but got white instead. Phone didn't look touched and was factory unlocked as needed. The phone is very buggy..im not sure if it's the software that unlocked it or if that's just the iphone's quality. Either way im happy knowing I can use any gsm carrier whenever and have plenty of memory to last till upgrade time.,4
"I ordered this phone, thinking it practically new, but it ended up not even being the phone I wanted. It was the iPhone 4 in White, and it had a crack in it. Also, the battery lifespan was no good. I'm using it because I have no other option, but hopefully someone will call the seller out on it next time.",3
Opyou are the first person i bought a iphone from! I love this when i got it it looked like it was brand new! Even though it had scratchs i cant get over it!,5
"This Iphone 4 was right out of the box ""new"", not a scratch on it. Works just as if I brought it from Best Buy or At&T. My son loves it ,and the price was a great. No problems what so ever.",5
"The phone is in really good cosmetic shape and the shipping was speedy, but what was not described was that the home button either does not function, or lags in response. We have had to download an icon app so that we can get to the home screen.",3
"The item was listed as ""like new"", but there were some problems. First, the ear speaker's filter is missing. Second, camera's flash does not work. I cannot understand how they call this item as ""like new"". However, I received %40 discount after buying this item because of these problems.",1
"Works good ,, as the product was as it was described. Works great . I do not have ATT but straight talk and its does not make no difference compared to ATT",5
"I ordered this for my boss and this product came very swiftly. Although some buttons aren't very responsive unless you press it down hard, there are no problems with the harddrive and it's how the item was described to be. He's happy with the phone and I would say this product and seller was very reliable.",3
"Battery lasted 6 months... do not recommend. This phone has a problem with the screen touch. Many times, it will not recognize I'm pressing a button on the screen. However, it will constantly think my ear is a button. It's VERY annoying!. I don't recommend buying this phone from this company.",1
"Second phone I have purchased from Amazon..., This one worked two weeks before freezing up. I read all the reviews and chose to try again but was disappointed for a second time. Our phones make or break our business so not having usage for an hour can impact our lives. Amazon has always faired well with every other purchase we have made.",2
I bought my phone used as to avoid the 2 year contract and high prices of the major companies. We put the phone on Straight Talk and we are loving it.,5
I bought this used item though it doesn't look like used. Except that it has a minor scratch on the back which is unnoticeable. Device is working good but the charging cable looks like not the original one because it broke at the joint exposing the inner wire otherwise great product as expected.,4
"Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone.",3
This product worked great for my birthday gift for my teenage son! High quality and arrived right on time! I really saved a lot of money in comparison to getting this same item at the store.Recommend it to anyone that is looking for savings all the way around on not just time but $$$.Regina,5
Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine,5
Phone doesn't get good reception. I have written to send it back and have received no comment back. It is the 4 of Sept. and must send it back by Sept. 6th. Not happy.,1
"Good used device. 80% good. Rare camera is not working. I showed it to I-Phone tech (iphoneaid.com) in Baltimore, MD. John fixed it in 15 minutes. Checked the I-phone and replaced the rare camera with new part. Thanks to Amazon and Iphoneaid.com",4
Purchased an iPhone to replace a broken one and the new one works almost perfectly so far with the exception of the home button. It appears a bit worn down and I'm needing to push the button down hard 3 and 4 times to get the phone to respond. Other than that seems to be in very good shape.,4
its all great i swear works just like a new i phone 4s but the top power button does not work unless i hold it down for about three times which hurts.,4
This phone was reported stolen and is on the at&t blacklist and is blocked from network use. It doesn't work even for at&t like it said it would. I talked to an at&t personnel and she looked up the phone and it was reported stolen.,1
"Phone looks and seems to work wonderfully, however the phones was locked! Thus making me spend more money to get it unlocked... Besides that the shipping was VERY fast!",4
"The iPhone i ordered actually came a day earlier than it was suppose to . The phone is used but works brand new . I've had it for about 3 and a half weeks now and I have absolutely no complaints . I definitely recommend ordering from this Seller to anyone, very professional and prompt .",5
"I got the phone early and was able to resync all my apps in short time, I was very happy to be up and running again with this phone , Thank you for quick service,",4
"Got the iphone a little bit early. They said it would be in perfect condition. Well the iphone came and I had to restore it. After I restored it, I tried to play music and one of the speakers doesn't work. The call volume is also very low. nobody can hear me forreal but I can hear them. it'll sound like my fone is breaking up.",2
"Got the phone ahead if schedule, in the condition they described! But when I went to set it up, it came back stolen. I just don't understand how someone can sale stolen products! How do you not know??",1
"I bought three of those iPhone as a gift. I know in the ads they said it is used.But they are in good quality, no cracks or any bad signs on any of them. The price was a bargain. I liked them so much that I placed another order for two more.Good communication with the seller too.ThanksOmaima",5
does not come in box that is bad not wash brings to insert the sim card and cash are not nuebo are usedotherwise and binding to and release for Latin America if it do not work,2
The phone looks nice and works but the home button you have to press hard sometime don't like that.Everything else work great. Still like check on YouTube on how to fix it hope that works.,3
"I bought this phone and after a months of using it,it died on me i took it to the Apple store to have it fix and they told that my phone was faked...meaning amazon sell fake stuff for high prices.",1
"This phone was advertised as ""NEW"". When it died after 7 months, I found out through Apple it was refurbished. Vantage Cellular will not return my emails and Apple will not fix because I am not the original owner. DON'T TRUST VANTAGE CELLULAR",1
Awesome phone absolutely no wear and tear perfect condition working awsomly and can put any sim from any carrier any phone (well as long as its a micro sim) and start using it on the spot very pleased...,5
Amazon hopes the sale of second-hand mobile phones to establish standards to limit certain unscrupulous businessmen shoddy second-hand mobile phones. I hope bad business to strictly enforce the Amazon proprietary standard used phones.,3
I placed an order for Iphone 4 AT&T lock and was delivered an IPHONE 4S Verizon Lock. I have travelled abroad therefore I can't return the IPHONE 4S Verizon Lock and latter I check for ESN and found that it had a BAD ESN. I am totally disappointed by this purchase. I am not able to replace this phone.,1
"LOVED the phone, until I realized that the home button did not work. Could not make it go ""home"" no matter what I did. Was easy to return and get money back, But will NOT buy from this seller again. Phone was suppose to be in very good condition, would HATE it see what condition a phone in ""good"" condition would be like.",1
"The iPhone 4 32 GB (Black) - AT&T was presented as ""Brand New"" and turned out to be NOT. An Apple store technician told me that it is a ""Frankenstein."" /ss",1
"the signal is super weak, the phone is out of signal most the time.The battery is ran out so quick and also the phone gets boiling hot just after 20 mins on calling.Often, the shop pauses by itself and you cannot return the home page.Definitely wasting my money on this phone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"We haven't had much success with used apple products, but I decided to give it one more go. This phone is exactly as the seller described. It works beautifully. Most importantly, I have a very happy 15 year old whose iPhone 3 was seriously on it's last leg. Her favorite feature is facetime. :)",5
The iPhone was like other experiences with iPhone orders I have had with Amazon. Everything was perfect! The phone arrived exactly on time and was in mint condition just as the seller described.,5
"Too Many scratches on the glass and on the sides, look one in craigslist or pay few more to buy a new one or a different model rather than this used phone. I'm totally disappointed after looking at this phone.I will return and better look for one on craigslist.",1
"I have to say that i am happy with my iphone, i have received it and it was pretty much what the comments said about it!I am happy with the whole experience.",5
I needed to step into the smartphone world for work and my ATT plan was not up yet. I checked everywhere and Amazon had the best prices and the best guarantees. This phone was in superb condition and I am loving it!,5
i give it 2 stars because the battery lasted literally 2 weeks and then it would go dead after 30 minutes. and the phone wouldn't send texts if the phone was moving. had more problems but it is an i phone 4..... so i dont wanna bash. would definitely,2
Phone arrived on time and it was in great shape no scratches on screen. The charger we received with phone was cheap made phone act funny when using while charging,4
I enjoyed this phone. It was in great condition and it works really well. I think that Amazon is a great place to purchase products because they have always treated me right. I would recommend Amazon to any body. It is convenient and I like it.,5
"The price was good but the phone has much more scratches than I expected. The lense on the camara is so scratched that I cannot take a clear picture, also there was a sticker with the phone info stuck directly on the phone.",3
I love this phone so much it works great now but a few days after I got it it broke and wouldn't turn on so I took it to the apple store and now it works great,4
"The phone was exactly how it was advertised, my son is very happy with this phone. Took it to AT&T and didnt have one second of trouble getting the phone activated for service. Minimal scratches and fast delivery. Awesome service",5
Please send a very bad version. What is going on? What are you asking me again? Too bad the broken screens which use the blue lights. I asked for my money.,1
"All I can say is I ordered the phone and it arrived on time. I gave it to my 13y/o daughter as a Christmas gift. As of right now, it is working just fine. I would recommend this to others.",3
Phone did freeze and went completely black for hours but was still on contaced apple support to figure out why and they told me how to fix the issue hopefully it doesnt happen again the phone itself is in very good condition besides this incident,4
"I bought this phone 2 years ago and it worked perfectly fine but after a couple months of use the home button stopped working and eventually the lock button on top began to stick, I just sold this phone to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 which is way better than this phone.",3
"Product was sold as new, but was used. We found data from the previous owner. The phone freezes and has to be shut down and started again to get it to operate.",1
"I'm fairly disappointed with this purchase. First off, the home button doesn't work very well as you almost have to pound on the button to get it to work. Secondly, I specifically purchased this listing because it claimed to be unlocked which was not true. Overall I am quite disappointed with this purchase.",2
"Blown away. Not a scratch on it. Looks like a brand new phone. Came packaged just like a brand new phone. Performs like a brand new phone. Was marked ""like new"". But even better than that.",5
"Update, the camera lens was not scratched, it had a protective film over the lens that we thought where scratches. The phone works great, and was worth the money we paid. Sorry for my ignorance.",5
"I've never had an iPhone so this was a huge deal for me, I took the risk to get a used one and I do not regret it, the seller gave me the phone with 4 more cables besides the original, original box with documentation, earpods, wall charger and even a black case. The seller even gave me the apple store bag. Thanks Hollywood Studio Gems!",5
"The iphone is like new and it works perfect, The only complain is when I read the item it said that was unlocked but that was not true. I have to pay 27 box more to get it free....",4
When we finally got this phone is was in great condition. Looked brand new!I bought it for my daughter and she was so happy! Everything works well no problems;-),5
"The item was sold as new, but when I received the phone it was easy to see that the phone had had its screen replaces. Not only that, the screen was poorly replaces and was moving. It was frustrating, since the item was supposed to be a gift, and so I had to find a different one at the last second.",1
Please I need to know how to find the key to download apps on my iphone 4 as Venezuela and buy it for when I go to the downloads me for a password and an ID,5
i started using the phone and it ok and stuff but the lock button did not work it came in a zip lock bag with a non working apple cable and i like it no other problem about it,3
"We bought it and the seller said it worked well, and that was not the case. It constantly froze up and the battery did not last at all. Sorry I bought it because now it sits in my drawer because my parents could not use it.",1
I ordered this on the 18th of December and I asked them to have it delivered by Christmas and I revived it by the 23rd my daughter had a great Christmas happy happy happy,5
The phone works.. But I am having some problems with it. When I push the home key it doesn't clear my screen right always I have to push it several time for it to clear.. My lock button is stuck and my volume key sticks..,3
"I loved this phone till it crapped out on me, got a new windows phone and love it more then the iphone will never go back to an apple product again Microsoft soooooooo much better people",3
"Its ok. Awsome. Is great for the price the only thing that was bad was the wall charger cube, it generated no charge just on and off. i had to charge the phone on a old charging dock station. Overall im satisfied. Will submit an update a review soon.",5
A lot of the apps that are out there now will not work with the older OS. The Iphone 4 is limited as to upgrades in OS as well. While I knew I was buying old technology I didn't realize that the apps were no longer available.,3
this phone is in good condition but it dos not work properl the wi-fi is slow download is slow calling and texting is slow i would like to return it back and get my money back pleas,1
I was in desperate need of a new phone and this iPhone/seller was one of the best and highly rated ones I could find. I got my order right on time and the phone was perfect. Brand new just like the description said! I couldn't be happier right now. I will definitely be recommending this seller and product if anyone is looking for a new phone:),5
"I actually bought this for my brother and the description said used - like new but when it came, it wasn't i expected and the packaging was even not that good. I wasn't satisfied.",3
I love this phone it is the greatest purchase ever! I recommend this phone to everyone but be careful of the seller you purchase it from I had to have a blank sim card in order to setup my phone to get the apple apps that came with the phone after my seller reset the phone.,5
When it came it had been used before. I went to the apple store because it didn't work and when they looked up the serial number it had been pre owned ( it was advertised as a new phone),1
I thought i was taking a risk on buying this phone. But i wanted a 4 so bad. I read most of the reviews after i ordered the phone. I was worried until i recieved the phone early . In good condition and is working in good condition,5
"The phone itself isn't new. I received an iphone in decent condition but there were scuff marks around the sides, dirt in the volume buttons, and the home button doesn't work very well. Other than the minor ware, the phone is in fairly good condition.",3
"I ordered the used phone and I was unsure how it look alike, good or bad. Wow! I was so happy when i received the phone. It look new and exactly what he described. I would like to recommend this vendor to everyone.",5
I love my phone. It came in the original packaging with all accessories. It was delivered when promised and was in the condition described. It was actually in better shape than I expected.,5
"I feel very good the whole process even today I have not received one month ago maybe by season, but all good thank god ..... just want to know if the iPhone is released internationally and if you send a code to unlock it.",4
I was showing the Iphone tu my nephew and then went blank and hot and no way to be turned of ... then it dies... I lost my money...I wish to have it back but how?>??/,1
Next Time you sell something you should have the box Sealed .When i got this product the Box Was Opened and it said New and you saidyou opened it to see if everything was in the box .Inside was a 16.Gb Phone Instead of a 32.Gb Phone .You tried to take me as a Skr.,1
"I am not a HUGE Apple guy, but I can't imagine owning another phone! This one was a replacement for the iPhone 4 that I lost while traveling recently. My wife owns one of the Droid phones and she is NOWHERE NEAR AS HAPPY WITH HER PHONE AS I AM WITH MINE! I plan on keeping this phone until I NEED a new one!!!!",5
the back screen was all cracked but i didnt worry about that because the phone was used but what i am worrying about is how the phone only came with the charging chord and not the oulet part another thing is the chager dosnt even work so now i have wait till tomorrow to get a charger and hope it was the chager and not the phone overall not so good,2
"The dealer was fraudulent, claiming that the phone was new in the box. In fact, it was 3 years old, needed a new battery, and had a defective microphone. It cost $150.00 to replace it with a new iPhone 4 from Apple. Apple can tell you the history of the phone by it's serial number. Never buy from this dealer.",1
"I got this phone used. As advertised it had only minor scratches and it is totally functional. Great costumer support, answered within 1 day and really helpful!",5
"i purchased this iphone from the amazon warehouse and when i opened it, it looked brand new the only thing to complain about is the home button but that is not even a big deal. It also did take very long to ship and UPS is truly the most crappiest delivery company i've ever had to deal with. But other than that i am very happy with this purchase.",4
"I wasn't able to afford a galaxy s3 or 4 or iPhone yet. I was so happy to see this deal. The used phone was pretty much new, no scratches working properly. The shipping was fast I just connected with AIO(great plan they have by the way). I am very satisfied. I haven't had no issues with amazon yet anyway. Love love the phone",5
Would recommend them to anyone. I washed them and they came out beautifully when I took them out of the dryer. You can tell they are high quality sheets.,5
"As discrived, on time, I contacted them, they crarified my concerns, and the phone works as I expected so far, Service was really good, the person was really great.",5
"its a good phone. I needed to get a new phone. so I found this one, only used 2 times. and its my baby. it may not be the lastest iPhone, but I love it.",5
I really didn't want an Iphone then to top it all off the Product was Horrid... It only Worked on Speakerphone... The Home Key Got Stuck.. I was very displeased!!! I wouldn't buy another iPhone to save My life!!!,1
The has a short battery life. I am constantly recharging. The phone take too long to power up. I am strongly considering selling it and get another brand.,2
The bottom center button often will not engage. When the button is pressed the phone often does not respond. I think that the button is dying. It is not working full.It is not the end of the world but a bit disappointing.,3
"I'm OCD and the phone came with a scratch right through the light for the camera. It doesn't affect the picture quality, but amazon said it was a brand new phone! Brand new phones don't have scratches!",4
This is the worst phone I have ever purchased or seen in my life. The camera does not work! It freezes and won't let you take a picture. I even brought it in to be fixed and the guy laughed at me and told me to return it as soon as possible. He said he could not fix it and that I should get my money back! Heads up.. Don't buy this phone!,1
"thks, i receive in costa rica, i need to unlock but i do with at&t in states without problems, thank you guys Im using internationally too and works great! love it",5
"I got this for my son to get him started on the IPhone but without having to break the bank. It will last him a couple of years and then we can upgrade again. The product was brand new, works great and does everything he needs. The seller was prompt. It came right away.",4
I ordered this device on Wednesday and it arrived 2 days later. That was very unexpected. I got everything it said I would except for the headphones. But I'm ok with that because Apples headphones aren't that great. Overall. A great experience. I would definately buy again.,5
I bought my phone used as to avoid the 2 year contract and high prices of the major companies. We put the phone on Straight Talk and we are loving it.,5
I bought this used item though it doesn't look like used. Except that it has a minor scratch on the back which is unnoticeable. Device is working good but the charging cable looks like not the original one because it broke at the joint exposing the inner wire otherwise great product as expected.,4
"Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone.",3
This product worked great for my birthday gift for my teenage son! High quality and arrived right on time! I really saved a lot of money in comparison to getting this same item at the store.Recommend it to anyone that is looking for savings all the way around on not just time but $$$.Regina,5
Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine,5
Love it so far. The Home button doesn't work but the seller told me that at the very beginning. The assisted Home button (setting you have to turn on) works great.,4
"The product was a huge disappointment. After a week of use, callers could not hear your voice when you called out on the phone. The only way to use the phone, as a phone, is with headphones. I do not recommend product and did not purchase the product just to be able to text.",2
"I fine this phone to be very well made, and it's loaded. I had a android phone before my iPhone, if I had to rate the difference I would pick this phone first. This phone is much more sophisticated, but people friendly.",4
"The purchase of this iphone 4 has caused me so much hassle and waste of time. What a total regret buying this phone from ""mobilekarma"" Not only was it sold to me as a blacklisted phone, there's no way to get this iphone off the list. I had contacted mobile karma and they have no means to settling or solving this issue.",1
"This company seems like a joke to me, I got the phone but at least once a week I have to reset it. Like factory reset it. For the money I paid, shipping hassles I had, that is not worht",1
This product arrived in box and with accessories that work! But we paid too much for this phone bc it continuously goes to the reboot screen! We are trying to find out how to fix this problem...but it is difficult!,2
"After spending an addt'l $100 to replace the broken glass, once service was activated, we found out the owner did not remove his personal information and in order for us to do it, we needed his password. After several conversations with the seller, at the end of the day, he would not provide his pass code thus the phone was useless.",1
My son wanted to be iphone nation but I had just switched carriers. So I was not going to pay full price for a new phone. Then I said let me look on Amazon.com. this phone did not have scratch on it. Perfect condition. My son loves it. Thank you. Money well spent.,5
"recivi the phone on May 19, I have three weeks to cell. and already I comenso to fail. I understand you buy a used phone, but poorly selling phones that do not work. the phone turns itself off, and now if not connected to the charger can not make or RECEIVE calls. very bad of this company selling cellular useless",1
"The lock won't work after a week and the charger messed up, plus the phone begins to get slow but great camera and can connect it to metro and iMessage is great.",4
The iPhone was in great condition. No scratches or marks on it. I added my SIM card and the phone has been working great. I have not found anything wrong or not working properly. Worth the money!,5
"I ordered a used IPhone 4 from this place and I am very satisfied with it. It barely has any scratches or tears just like the pictures. It came within a week, and when I went to activate it with metro pcs it worked perfctly. I am gad I got my phone from here, if I upgrade Im definitely using this place again.",5
"i bought a cell phone that has a hardware problem, i sent it to repair to an official app store and they told me that i had been cheated by the seller...so think before buying to cell squad because it can happen the same to you!",1

We had a question about the iPhone and the dealer got back with us the same day we asked. They explain to us some items about the iPhone and our grandson is very satisfied with his new phone.,5
Great phone my son wanted a iPhone so I decided to go with the 4 until I know he can be responsible with it. Came the day it was suppose to unlocked no problem at all.,5
"This is my second one, and is really frustrating because i have to take it too have everything copied. I can hear other people on line, but they can not hear me sometimes.",1
there were multiple issues with the phone that was supposed to be refurbished. this was the first product I purchased through here that I can say was a waste of money and I order a lot.,1
This is clearly the wrong phone and it would be excellent if whomever repackaged this actually looked at the box which clearly states VERIZON not what it was sold as AT&T. The irony here is these 2 different networks also use different carries AT&T is GSM and Verizon is CDMA. So this phone is a complete fail there too.,1
"Rated 1 Star because the description said GOOD quality, not an iPhone with a broken home button that doesn't work unless I jam it down. Will have to take to the Apple store for a fix, and could not return it to Amazon because of time constraints. Annoying.",1
"This phone came quickly! It said it was ""like new"" and it seemed completely new--had the plastic on the front, etc. It had no scratches, etc. We ordered this phone for my daughter and she was totally excited. This came from the Amazon Warehouse and I would certainly recommend ordering from them. It included the headphones which was great also.",5
"I wouldn't have minded buying a phone with a dysfunctional charger, but I would have liked to know what I was purchasing upfront. Luckily, the charger of the phone I'm switching fits this phone - if not, I'd be a very unhappy man with a new phone and no charger. I do want to say everything else was perfect, and I appreciate the price.",4
"The item was listed as ""like new"", but there were some problems. First, the ear speaker's filter is missing. Second, camera's flash does not work. I cannot understand how they call this item as ""like new"". However, I received %40 discount after buying this item because of these problems.",1
"Works good ,, as the product was as it was described. Works great . I do not have ATT but straight talk and its does not make no difference compared to ATT",5
"I ordered this for my boss and this product came very swiftly. Although some buttons aren't very responsive unless you press it down hard, there are no problems with the harddrive and it's how the item was described to be. He's happy with the phone and I would say this product and seller was very reliable.",3
Purchased it to use it as a secondary phone and it worked great. Now I only use it as a backup phone but I am glad I have a phone to go to in case of emergencies.,5
omg i am so happy i found this phone i had one and the on and off button quit working on me and i was searching amazon and found one just like it and i received it fast thankyou so very much for the fast shipping,5
"SHIPPED A 16 GB WITH A FAKE PAPER PRINTED 32 GB LABLE WITH A BARCODE AND A IMEI NUMBER, TOOK IT TO APPLE AND CONFIRMED IT WAS A 16 GB, AND ATT CONFIRMED THE BARCODE WAS NOT THERES AS THEY DO NOT BARCODE THEIR PHONES THEY USE APPLES ORIGONAL, DO NOT BUY!!!",1
Product was in excellent condition. I ordered this to replace the not very user friendly android phone I had been using. I will never have anything but an iPhone from here on out.,5
"this phone was sold as new worked for 3 mnths then stopped took it to the nearest apple store which was 3 hrs away for them to tell me it was a ""frankinstien"" meaning there were some apple parts an some that were not now NOBODY will help 300$ just gone",1
"It's not bad for the price, but there is lots of glitches in it! Another thing, it says it comes with a charger and it didn't! The only thing good about it is that it came quick!!",2
I received the phone the day before I expected it and the condition was better than expected. But when placing phone calls the person on the other line can not hear you. I constantly breaks up. had to go back to old cell phone and looking to purchase another phone. the two stars are for the shipping time and appearance.,2
"Purchased this product as new. Proximity sensor failed. Apple support told me this phone was purchased in 2011and had no factory warranty. Company will not do any replacement after 30 days, so beware. I have a phone that I cannot use for phone calls. I will not purchase from these people as they state the product is new, but it is not!,",1
Phone was brand new and worked great.. I also recieved it in 2 business days which was awesome because I paid for standard shipping..my only complaint is the price was a little ridiculous for an iPhone 4 so I'm rating the phone a 4,4
Phone did freeze and went completely black for hours but was still on contaced apple support to figure out why and they told me how to fix the issue hopefully it doesnt happen again the phone itself is in very good condition besides this incident,4
"I bought this phone 2 years ago and it worked perfectly fine but after a couple months of use the home button stopped working and eventually the lock button on top began to stick, I just sold this phone to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 which is way better than this phone.",3
I would have kept this phone had it they allowed me to have updates past 7.1. Now Apple has updates for Iphone 4 users. I say get it if you need a cheap go-to smartphone.,4
I bought my phone used as to avoid the 2 year contract and high prices of the major companies. We put the phone on Straight Talk and we are loving it.,5
I bought this used item though it doesn't look like used. Except that it has a minor scratch on the back which is unnoticeable. Device is working good but the charging cable looks like not the original one because it broke at the joint exposing the inner wire otherwise great product as expected.,4
"Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone.",3
This product worked great for my birthday gift for my teenage son! High quality and arrived right on time! I really saved a lot of money in comparison to getting this same item at the store.Recommend it to anyone that is looking for savings all the way around on not just time but $$$.Regina,5
Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine,5
"The dealer was fraudulent, claiming that the phone was new in the box. In fact, it was 3 years old, needed a new battery, and had a defective microphone. It cost $150.00 to replace it with a new iPhone 4 from Apple. Apple can tell you the history of the phone by it's serial number. Never buy from this dealer.",1
"I got this phone used. As advertised it had only minor scratches and it is totally functional. Great costumer support, answered within 1 day and really helpful!",5
"i purchased this iphone from the amazon warehouse and when i opened it, it looked brand new the only thing to complain about is the home button but that is not even a big deal. It also did take very long to ship and UPS is truly the most crappiest delivery company i've ever had to deal with. But other than that i am very happy with this purchase.",4
"I wasn't able to afford a galaxy s3 or 4 or iPhone yet. I was so happy to see this deal. The used phone was pretty much new, no scratches working properly. The shipping was fast I just connected with AIO(great plan they have by the way). I am very satisfied. I haven't had no issues with amazon yet anyway. Love love the phone",5
"I bought this phone and after a months of using it,it died on me i took it to the Apple store to have it fix and they told that my phone was faked...meaning amazon sell fake stuff for high prices.",1
"Needed a replacement phone for my daughter This one made her very happy! Was received in as advertised condition. Fully functional. No noticeable scratches on screen, original plastic on back, and otterbox works great.",5
"I wrote a previous review about this phone. It was not a 32GB as listed, but a 16GB. It was not unlocked either. After contacting Amazon, they did all that was necessary to correct the problem along with a full upfront refund before receiving the phone back. Thank you to Amazon for their hard work in the customer service department.",5
"My sons first smart phone and he loves it! The phone came in excellent condition. For the price and condition it's in, my wife and I consider the phone a steal!",5
"good items, the condition is good, working perfect, i apreciated that the description is real, the software is correct, the hardware is very aceptable, work fine great item dear seller!!! five start for your",5
"The phone works pretty well, but I have had to bypass a button that allows you to change screens because it was sticky and wouldn't always work. I was glad to see that the phone offered this option, must be a common issue with older phones.",4
"what can I say? I previously purchased an I phone from the AT&T. When I found out I had a $200 deductible to replace it, I got this one instead. Great phone. better price. Same phone.",5
The phone in its self is amazing but the batteries messed up in both it won't stay charged for nothing and then you plug it in and I jumps the percent of the phone up like 10% like its not really dying,2
"Freezes a lot, also you can no longer pay to get att network switched to tmoible are vise versa. Very easy to crack, I ended up getting the iPhone 5 after cracking three 4s's in a year, and I'm much more pleased.",3
Beautiful. Best phone I've ever had. Arrived with maybe two scratches. Is eligible for straight talk from Walmart which is a great deal. Never a loss of service. Excellent buy,5
I like the phone but when I call somebody and I can hear them but they can not hear me. That sucks cuz I like to talk to people more than texting. Like I can't call work when I'm going to be late. I would have to text someone who going to work that day so they can say that I going to be late.,2
"I am very happy with my phone. It actually came 2 days earlier than scheduled. It was in excellent working condition. I read a bunch of reviews before I ordered it. I was worried about buying used electronics. Something I never do. But, I'm glad I did. I saved alot of money and That's always a plus!",5
"I got this for my son to get him started on the IPhone but without having to break the bank. It will last him a couple of years and then we can upgrade again. The product was brand new, works great and does everything he needs. The seller was prompt. It came right away.",4
I ordered this device on Wednesday and it arrived 2 days later. That was very unexpected. I got everything it said I would except for the headphones. But I'm ok with that because Apples headphones aren't that great. Overall. A great experience. I would definately buy again.,5
"Its ok. Awsome. Is great for the price the only thing that was bad was the wall charger cube, it generated no charge just on and off. i had to charge the phone on a old charging dock station. Overall im satisfied. Will submit an update a review soon.",5
A lot of the apps that are out there now will not work with the older OS. The Iphone 4 is limited as to upgrades in OS as well. While I knew I was buying old technology I didn't realize that the apps were no longer available.,3
Would recommend them to anyone. I washed them and they came out beautifully when I took them out of the dryer. You can tell they are high quality sheets.,5
"As discrived, on time, I contacted them, they crarified my concerns, and the phone works as I expected so far, Service was really good, the person was really great.",5
"Got the iphone a little bit early. They said it would be in perfect condition. Well the iphone came and I had to restore it. After I restored it, I tried to play music and one of the speakers doesn't work. The call volume is also very low. nobody can hear me forreal but I can hear them. it'll sound like my fone is breaking up.",2
"Got the phone ahead if schedule, in the condition they described! But when I went to set it up, it came back stolen. I just don't understand how someone can sale stolen products! How do you not know??",1
"I bought three of those iPhone as a gift. I know in the ads they said it is used.But they are in good quality, no cracks or any bad signs on any of them. The price was a bargain. I liked them so much that I placed another order for two more.Good communication with the seller too.ThanksOmaima",5
does not come in box that is bad not wash brings to insert the sim card and cash are not nuebo are usedotherwise and binding to and release for Latin America if it do not work,2
The phone looks nice and works but the home button you have to press hard sometime don't like that.Everything else work great. Still like check on YouTube on how to fix it hope that works.,3
"I ordered a used Iphone 4. I was sent a NEW one!!!! AMAZING!Much better condition than expected. :)The product arrived VERY FAST.Great service, Highly recommended.",5
"Pros:Nice storageVery nice designWorks flawlesslyIt just plain worksCons:NoneOverall: It does everything I ever wanted a device to do and more. IMO, Apple makes products that works so well that you don't even think about it.",5
"I ordered a phone but upon receiving it, the screen would constantly flicker. It was brand new in manufacturing packaging so I'm sure it was an apple defect. I contacted the company and they were very attentive and worked with me. Best customer service I've received in a long time.",5
"this iphone was worth the money i paid, it was cheap therefore i was expecting some sort of minimum malfunction, happens that the home button was a bit warned out but still workedno complains",3
"defective, did not disclosed was having problems, took it to apple and is not repairable, ended up buying new one, should have gone that route from the beginning, ended up paying him over 250 and for new one for 500.will not recommend to anyone for used iPhone, from internet",1
"Product was sold as new, but was used. We found data from the previous owner. The phone freezes and has to be shut down and started again to get it to operate.",1
"I'm fairly disappointed with this purchase. First off, the home button doesn't work very well as you almost have to pound on the button to get it to work. Secondly, I specifically purchased this listing because it claimed to be unlocked which was not true. Overall I am quite disappointed with this purchase.",2
After 3 weeks phone didn't work lots of problems not worth it . You could hear them but they couldn't hear you then in reverse. 1 out 23 calls would work if you were lucky . Don't waste your time or your money .,1
"Would of liked a printed booklet of how to set things up.I am senor citizen & need to read something other than on just phone..Had to purchase ""how to book""",3
The phone was in excellent condition and we have had no issues with it. The charger stopped working about a week later. Other than that I have nothing negative to say about our experience.,4
Love it so far. The Home button doesn't work but the seller told me that at the very beginning. The assisted Home button (setting you have to turn on) works great.,4
"The product was a huge disappointment. After a week of use, callers could not hear your voice when you called out on the phone. The only way to use the phone, as a phone, is with headphones. I do not recommend product and did not purchase the product just to be able to text.",2
Phone doesn't get good reception. I have written to send it back and have received no comment back. It is the 4 of Sept. and must send it back by Sept. 6th. Not happy.,1
A family member keeps breaking his phone. I didn't want to buy a brand new one. This re-furbished phone is working great and I couldn't beat the price.,5
"Good used device. 80% good. Rare camera is not working. I showed it to I-Phone tech (iphoneaid.com) in Baltimore, MD. John fixed it in 15 minutes. Checked the I-phone and replaced the rare camera with new part. Thanks to Amazon and Iphoneaid.com",4
Purchased an iPhone to replace a broken one and the new one works almost perfectly so far with the exception of the home button. It appears a bit worn down and I'm needing to push the button down hard 3 and 4 times to get the phone to respond. Other than that seems to be in very good shape.,4
its all great i swear works just like a new i phone 4s but the top power button does not work unless i hold it down for about three times which hurts.,4
This phone was reported stolen and is on the at&t blacklist and is blocked from network use. It doesn't work even for at&t like it said it would. I talked to an at&t personnel and she looked up the phone and it was reported stolen.,1
"Phone looks and seems to work wonderfully, however the phones was locked! Thus making me spend more money to get it unlocked... Besides that the shipping was VERY fast!",4
"The iPhone i ordered actually came a day earlier than it was suppose to . The phone is used but works brand new . I've had it for about 3 and a half weeks now and I have absolutely no complaints . I definitely recommend ordering from this Seller to anyone, very professional and prompt .",5
"I got the phone early and was able to resync all my apps in short time, I was very happy to be up and running again with this phone , Thank you for quick service,",4
"It can run the newest iOS. No Siri but I do not much care about that. The disappointment is that is just 3G and does not support 4G. Responds well, has Face Time.",4
I bought this iPhone 2 years ago and I'm still using it it came like the info said and like the pictures I recommend anyone getting iphone 4 go hereI just now figured out the ratings and reviews sorry took so long get backWith everyone,5
This was my first time purchasing a phone on Amazon. Was pleased with the price and selection. Phone works well - have had no problems at all. Will definately use for future purchases,5
"Everything is really good except the battery life does not last very long at all, had an iPhone 4 before this one and battery life was excellent but his one sucks",3
"Even though the iPhone 6 will be out soon, I fell in love with this phone. The processor makes everything super quick, and even though non-market apps are much easier to obtain on an Android, I find that the versatility of the iPhone makes up for it",5
Phone is in realy nice condition. Only charging cabel broke down affter two weeks of using. I'm afraid it wasn't original. Skiping that everything works well.,4
Got this for my daughter and she loved it! The seller was great and tie this day my daughter is still using that phone. This was her first smartphone and I think its a good starter for anyone under 13.,5
After 2 months the home button doesn't work. Took it to Apple to fix. They said it was out of warranty. Found out that it was a 2010 product. YUCKYUCKYUCK!Will cost $150 to replace/fix.Buyer Beware!,1
I enjoyed this phone. It was in great condition and it works really well. I think that Amazon is a great place to purchase products because they have always treated me right. I would recommend Amazon to any body. It is convenient and I like it.,5
"The price was good but the phone has much more scratches than I expected. The lense on the camara is so scratched that I cannot take a clear picture, also there was a sticker with the phone info stuck directly on the phone.",3
I love this phone so much it works great now but a few days after I got it it broke and wouldn't turn on so I took it to the apple store and now it works great,4
"The phone was exactly how it was advertised, my son is very happy with this phone. Took it to AT&T and didnt have one second of trouble getting the phone activated for service. Minimal scratches and fast delivery. Awesome service",5
Please send a very bad version. What is going on? What are you asking me again? Too bad the broken screens which use the blue lights. I asked for my money.,1
"All I can say is I ordered the phone and it arrived on time. I gave it to my 13y/o daughter as a Christmas gift. As of right now, it is working just fine. I would recommend this to others.",3
"Bought these phones for my brothers; received them in a very timely manner. No scratches, phones worked great! I definitely recommend purchasing from this user.",5
"I love the iPhone, the only thing because nw the Sim card is smaller,great devise I send it all the way to Jamaica and in the process of getting myself 1 ( Julie)",4
"Blown away. Not a scratch on it. Looks like a brand new phone. Came packaged just like a brand new phone. Performs like a brand new phone. Was marked ""like new"". But even better than that.",5
"Update, the camera lens was not scratched, it had a protective film over the lens that we thought where scratches. The phone works great, and was worth the money we paid. Sorry for my ignorance.",5
"I've never had an iPhone so this was a huge deal for me, I took the risk to get a used one and I do not regret it, the seller gave me the phone with 4 more cables besides the original, original box with documentation, earpods, wall charger and even a black case. The seller even gave me the apple store bag. Thanks Hollywood Studio Gems!",5
"The iphone is like new and it works perfect, The only complain is when I read the item it said that was unlocked but that was not true. I have to pay 27 box more to get it free....",4
When we finally got this phone is was in great condition. Looked brand new!I bought it for my daughter and she was so happy! Everything works well no problems;-),5
"The item was sold as new, but when I received the phone it was easy to see that the phone had had its screen replaces. Not only that, the screen was poorly replaces and was moving. It was frustrating, since the item was supposed to be a gift, and so I had to find a different one at the last second.",1
Please I need to know how to find the key to download apps on my iphone 4 as Venezuela and buy it for when I go to the downloads me for a password and an ID,5
i started using the phone and it ok and stuff but the lock button did not work it came in a zip lock bag with a non working apple cable and i like it no other problem about it,3
"I fine this phone to be very well made, and it's loaded. I had a android phone before my iPhone, if I had to rate the difference I would pick this phone first. This phone is much more sophisticated, but people friendly.",4
"The purchase of this iphone 4 has caused me so much hassle and waste of time. What a total regret buying this phone from ""mobilekarma"" Not only was it sold to me as a blacklisted phone, there's no way to get this iphone off the list. I had contacted mobile karma and they have no means to settling or solving this issue.",1
"This company seems like a joke to me, I got the phone but at least once a week I have to reset it. Like factory reset it. For the money I paid, shipping hassles I had, that is not worht",1
This product arrived in box and with accessories that work! But we paid too much for this phone bc it continuously goes to the reboot screen! We are trying to find out how to fix this problem...but it is difficult!,2
"After spending an addt'l $100 to replace the broken glass, once service was activated, we found out the owner did not remove his personal information and in order for us to do it, we needed his password. After several conversations with the seller, at the end of the day, he would not provide his pass code thus the phone was useless.",1
My son wanted to be iphone nation but I had just switched carriers. So I was not going to pay full price for a new phone. Then I said let me look on Amazon.com. this phone did not have scratch on it. Perfect condition. My son loves it. Thank you. Money well spent.,5
"Received the device. It appears fine. But the design is so-so. It the phone fails from your hand, the front of the phone can break easily. I wish they had better design than this. I recommend to any body.",4
Love this phone! The merchant shipped it quickly. Packaged nicely. It came in a new white iphone box including the accessories listed plus instruction manual. Great price. I got it for a present for my 18 year old and it is in their hand all the time. I want to buy more from this merchant.,5
"im returning this phone to Warehouse Deals, Inc. its so wrong to put up false advertisement. i thought that it was an ATT iphone but its not. be careful",1

I really didn't want an Iphone then to top it all off the Product was Horrid... It only Worked on Speakerphone... The Home Key Got Stuck.. I was very displeased!!! I wouldn't buy another iPhone to save My life!!!,1
The has a short battery life. I am constantly recharging. The phone take too long to power up. I am strongly considering selling it and get another brand.,2
The bottom center button often will not engage. When the button is pressed the phone often does not respond. I think that the button is dying. It is not working full.It is not the end of the world but a bit disappointing.,3
"This is my first return on Amazon and it appears to be very easy. As far as the product is concerned, its looks great but works terribly. Clearly a defect of some sort...all well, will return and purchase a new one",1

"This phone is amazing for the price. My son broke his new zillion dollar samsung s4 or whatever. So, we got him a cool phone at at great (and maybe disposable) price.We will look to this shipper/store again if we need a phone.",5
"I had to replace my lost iPhone 4s. As a frequent eBay customer, the amazon product is clearly superior. The quality is guaranteed to be like new and the price is much less expensive. I am considering buying another simply to sell it on eBay for the profit.",5
When it came it had been used before. I went to the apple store because it didn't work and when they looked up the serial number it had been pre owned ( it was advertised as a new phone),1
I thought i was taking a risk on buying this phone. But i wanted a 4 so bad. I read most of the reviews after i ordered the phone. I was worried until i recieved the phone early . In good condition and is working in good condition,5
"The phone itself isn't new. I received an iphone in decent condition but there were scuff marks around the sides, dirt in the volume buttons, and the home button doesn't work very well. Other than the minor ware, the phone is in fairly good condition.",3
"I ordered the used phone and I was unsure how it look alike, good or bad. Wow! I was so happy when i received the phone. It look new and exactly what he described. I would like to recommend this vendor to everyone.",5
The iPhone was like other experiences with iPhone orders I have had with Amazon. Everything was perfect! The phone arrived exactly on time and was in mint condition just as the seller described.,5
"Too Many scratches on the glass and on the sides, look one in craigslist or pay few more to buy a new one or a different model rather than this used phone. I'm totally disappointed after looking at this phone.I will return and better look for one on craigslist.",1
"I have to say that i am happy with my iphone, i have received it and it was pretty much what the comments said about it!I am happy with the whole experience.",5
I needed to step into the smartphone world for work and my ATT plan was not up yet. I checked everywhere and Amazon had the best prices and the best guarantees. This phone was in superb condition and I am loving it!,5
The home button and on button don't work on this item which was not mentioned in the seller notes. Otherwise good purchase. Certainly worth the amount I paid for it.,3
"Couldn't be happier if it was brand new, works great. The camera is really awesome, takes great shots and is really fast with the next ""frame"". I could take 50 pics in 30 seconds with out having to wait like most cell phone cameras. Changing apps is very fast as well.",5
"This phone was advertised as ""NEW"". When it died after 7 months, I found out through Apple it was refurbished. Vantage Cellular will not return my emails and Apple will not fix because I am not the original owner. DON'T TRUST VANTAGE CELLULAR",1
Awesome phone absolutely no wear and tear perfect condition working awsomly and can put any sim from any carrier any phone (well as long as its a micro sim) and start using it on the spot very pleased...,5
"The shipping on the phone was fast and timely. The phone works well, but acts slow sometimes. It is missing a screw. Other than those small things everything is cool.",4
IPhone 4 is pretty good.. However many features which are added in ios6 are not available for iPhone4. I don't see any real reason as hardware for many of the features. So little disappointed with that.,4
"THIS PHONE IS EN PERFECT CONDITIONS, ONE THING, THIS PHONE SENT ME WITHOUT A BOX. I DIDN'T LIKE IT BUT EVERYTHING WAS OK, IT'S LIKE NEW. I REALLY LOVE IT",4
"Loving my phone. Was even better with Siri, but I lose her with the upgrade, could hardly wait for the new jailbreak to get her back. I suggest if you intend to sell your phones again take Advantage of the protective covers. Sense this I have gotten a number of items through Amazon",4
"This is very good iPhone . When I bought. I didn't realize that was goodbut I take a chance to buy when I receive it, it was very good and comewith the box and with a complete accessories . I am very satisfy.",5
"Phone is in good condition but the home button doesn't work and there was no mention of that problem on the ad. Apple said they can replace or repair for a bout $140. Quick shipment, no problems other than that.",3
"if you want a 100% functional phone, don't buy this one. the phone arrives like a new, but the home button is not 100% functional. you have to push harder engough to make it work, it is annoying because you use the home button all the time.",2
"I bought one Iphone,supossed to be new, with this seller and the Iphone came broken I took it to a guy to put my sim card in it and the guy told me that the screen had already been changed and that the Iphone already had contact with water. And today my Iphone broke and I can't make calls or receive, I can't access the internet or my messages.",1
this phone is in good condition but it dos not work properl the wi-fi is slow download is slow calling and texting is slow i would like to return it back and get my money back pleas,1
I was in desperate need of a new phone and this iPhone/seller was one of the best and highly rated ones I could find. I got my order right on time and the phone was perfect. Brand new just like the description said! I couldn't be happier right now. I will definitely be recommending this seller and product if anyone is looking for a new phone:),5
"I actually bought this for my brother and the description said used - like new but when it came, it wasn't i expected and the packaging was even not that good. I wasn't satisfied.",3
I love this phone it is the greatest purchase ever! I recommend this phone to everyone but be careful of the seller you purchase it from I had to have a blank sim card in order to setup my phone to get the apple apps that came with the phone after my seller reset the phone.,5
i give it 2 stars because the battery lasted literally 2 weeks and then it would go dead after 30 minutes. and the phone wouldn't send texts if the phone was moving. had more problems but it is an i phone 4..... so i dont wanna bash. would definitely,2
Phone arrived on time and it was in great shape no scratches on screen. The charger we received with phone was cheap made phone act funny when using while charging,4
"The phone does have some very minor cosmetic damage, you wont see it when the case is on and the home button is a bit stubborn but i'll change that soon.",4
"they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used iphones when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described",5
i love it its great and the pics are great its just want i wanted a great i phone 4 thank u it cane on time that's what i love about the seller was great and on time and i would order from this company again. thank u again,5
The iphone 4 worked pretty good for 15 days but started acting up when I pushed the home button. It has 60% before I went to bed and at some point through the night it died. Very disappointed because this is my business phone.,2
"We bought it and the seller said it worked well, and that was not the case. It constantly froze up and the battery did not last at all. Sorry I bought it because now it sits in my drawer because my parents could not use it.",1
I ordered this on the 18th of December and I asked them to have it delivered by Christmas and I revived it by the 23rd my daughter had a great Christmas happy happy happy,5
The phone works.. But I am having some problems with it. When I push the home key it doesn't clear my screen right always I have to push it several time for it to clear.. My lock button is stuck and my volume key sticks..,3
"I loved this phone till it crapped out on me, got a new windows phone and love it more then the iphone will never go back to an apple product again Microsoft soooooooo much better people",3
"Worst experience ever , ordered a 32gb , iPhone , they sent one that had serious design issues. They expedited another phone to replace it this time it was an 8gb iPhone , I am extremely disappointed and will be very cautious in the future using them to order items or reccommdnding then to others .",1
"thks, i receive in costa rica, i need to unlock but i do with at&t in states without problems, thank you guys Im using internationally too and works great! love it",5
The phone looks great but the home button does not work. I immediately contacted the seller and received no acknowledgement of my e-mail. I was able to adjust the settings on the phone to make it function. I am not satisfied with the seller at all.,2
"Awesome referbished phone. I would definitely recommend this to someone who's phone has been broken or stolen and is wanting a replacement iPhone. If you are inelidgible for an upgrade and do not have insurance, this is definitely the cheapest route. Great way of purchasing an iPhone at a discounted price.",5
"Decent phone, about what I expected for a used phone. The battery life isn't as good as I hoped, and the screen is sometimes unresponsive, but overall it's what you ought to expect if you're not buying new.",4
"I'm disappointed because I was told this phone is unlocked but I had a rude awakening when I tried to use it Nigeria. I had to spend more money to get it unlocked. Please when you're selling a product, try to abide by your promises.",1
"after couple weeks of using it , i couldnt and still noone can hear me when i give or receive a calltechnically i just use it to txt although i am paying for a service to get both but i can use it as i want",1
"I should have known why this phone was so cheap - it doesn't work. We got it out of the box and it looked fine. Took it to ATT to have the old phone transferred to the new. After all that there was ""no service"". AT&T further inspected to find that the hardware is faulty. Great!",1
"This phone was a refurbished phone, that was unlocked and I could use my home WiFi to look things up and start downloading apps before my SIM card come from the company I was changing too. I bought a 16 GB because I have a Ipod that was 32 GB to keep my music on and other games I play a lot.",5
"It's exactly as was described! I love it! It looks brand new! Came super fast and the sender was very easy to communicate with! On top of that, it was actually a 32 GB phone. The price was more than a deal! I would by from them again.",5
Cannot use sim card (overseas)Called ATT and they claimed they cannot unlock it because it isn't activatedAwaiting jailbreak info for IOS 7.1Had to order a different phone,2
"The phone is in really good cosmetic shape and the shipping was speedy, but what was not described was that the home button either does not function, or lags in response. We have had to download an icon app so that we can get to the home screen.",3
"Works great, received this phone on the date that was published, but as soon as i got it the battery was not fully charged and the charger was not working so i received a new charger. Now the phone is in great condition.",5
"Great deal, came in time, had it for over a month now, works Perfect just like it should.. I guess I just got lucky this time..:/ but yeah, good sell:)",5
I love the product that was purchased thru amazon. I love the prices the fast delivery and the quality of the phone that I have now. Thank you amazon!! A+,5
"The IPhone 4 does the job I need it to do. I use mine as a phone, GTD apps, and Music-Podcast player. I love the capacity. This is not the latest or greatest, but , for half the price I get 4/5ths of an IPhone 5.",5
I bought some of these used-like new iPhone products and it is good enough for me. it is locked by AT&T but not too hard to factory unlocked. highly recommend!,5
"This cell phone outside is very hurt, a lot of dust, too bad, all the accessories are not original, I want like to return, but I'm in China. I think I will not be here to buy second-hand goods.Feeling too bad! ! !",1
Sorry for the delay to feedback you....I was traveling...I really really like the product...It`s exactly how it was described....Thank you so much....,5
It was good product but the accessories are not of good quality.The charger and headphones are not of good quality.Proven the charger and headphones are fake.,1
"The iPhone 4 was sold as like new condition, the bottom right corner glass was shattered and the button intermittently works. It cost me $136 to have it repaired",1
Great phone! I would recommend it. It may not be the newest version of the iPhone but they are all the same thing in my view. I replaced my blackberry torch with this one.,5
I am very pleased with this item. The phone arrived within a short period of time. It was in a great shape and the seller even included a nice case and a charger.,5
The phone comes in a box like a brand new iPhone. I thought everything was fine with it but It drops a lot of calls and it freezes every once in awhile.,3
The quality of the iPhone I received was almost like new plus it came with its own otter box. It shipped out quickly as well. So I'm very satisfied!!!,5
"I did not get headphone with this item and because of other reasons too i returned this phone, and i got back full amount. I am happy that i got my money back.",3
"The phone was 8 gigs not 16 and it said good condition it didnt mention the crack on the screen.Phone works good but info was wrongIm happy with the iphone cuz is an iphoneBut if i need to sell it, im going to have to sell itfor $150 less cuz the screen costs $150",2
"sir , great phone , as exact u told , 100% satisfied , am really happy about this phone , and i can now buy again sometime from you without any fear :)",5
"Purchased it for my 16 year old daughter, she did not like the picture quality (future photographer/picky) and just didn't like it overall. It just wasn't for her. Ended up going with BLU Energy which she is loving.",2
Next Time you sell something you should have the box Sealed .When i got this product the Box Was Opened and it said New and you saidyou opened it to see if everything was in the box .Inside was a 16.Gb Phone Instead of a 32.Gb Phone .You tried to take me as a Skr.,1
"I am not a HUGE Apple guy, but I can't imagine owning another phone! This one was a replacement for the iPhone 4 that I lost while traveling recently. My wife owns one of the Droid phones and she is NOWHERE NEAR AS HAPPY WITH HER PHONE AS I AM WITH MINE! I plan on keeping this phone until I NEED a new one!!!!",5
the back screen was all cracked but i didnt worry about that because the phone was used but what i am worrying about is how the phone only came with the charging chord and not the oulet part another thing is the chager dosnt even work so now i have wait till tomorrow to get a charger and hope it was the chager and not the phone overall not so good,2
"The dealer was fraudulent, claiming that the phone was new in the box. In fact, it was 3 years old, needed a new battery, and had a defective microphone. It cost $150.00 to replace it with a new iPhone 4 from Apple. Apple can tell you the history of the phone by it's serial number. Never buy from this dealer.",1
"I got this phone used. As advertised it had only minor scratches and it is totally functional. Great costumer support, answered within 1 day and really helpful!",5
"i purchased this iphone from the amazon warehouse and when i opened it, it looked brand new the only thing to complain about is the home button but that is not even a big deal. It also did take very long to ship and UPS is truly the most crappiest delivery company i've ever had to deal with. But other than that i am very happy with this purchase.",4
"I wasn't able to afford a galaxy s3 or 4 or iPhone yet. I was so happy to see this deal. The used phone was pretty much new, no scratches working properly. The shipping was fast I just connected with AIO(great plan they have by the way). I am very satisfied. I haven't had no issues with amazon yet anyway. Love love the phone",5
"Freezes a lot, also you can no longer pay to get att network switched to tmoible are vise versa. Very easy to crack, I ended up getting the iPhone 5 after cracking three 4s's in a year, and I'm much more pleased.",3
Beautiful. Best phone I've ever had. Arrived with maybe two scratches. Is eligible for straight talk from Walmart which is a great deal. Never a loss of service. Excellent buy,5
I like the phone but when I call somebody and I can hear them but they can not hear me. That sucks cuz I like to talk to people more than texting. Like I can't call work when I'm going to be late. I would have to text someone who going to work that day so they can say that I going to be late.,2
"I am very happy with my phone. It actually came 2 days earlier than scheduled. It was in excellent working condition. I read a bunch of reviews before I ordered it. I was worried about buying used electronics. Something I never do. But, I'm glad I did. I saved alot of money and That's always a plus!",5
"The item was listed as ""like new"", but there were some problems. First, the ear speaker's filter is missing. Second, camera's flash does not work. I cannot understand how they call this item as ""like new"". However, I received %40 discount after buying this item because of these problems.",1
"Works good ,, as the product was as it was described. Works great . I do not have ATT but straight talk and its does not make no difference compared to ATT",5
"I ordered this for my boss and this product came very swiftly. Although some buttons aren't very responsive unless you press it down hard, there are no problems with the harddrive and it's how the item was described to be. He's happy with the phone and I would say this product and seller was very reliable.",3
We had a question about the iPhone and the dealer got back with us the same day we asked. They explain to us some items about the iPhone and our grandson is very satisfied with his new phone.,5
I received the phone the day before I expected it and the condition was better than expected. But when placing phone calls the person on the other line can not hear you. I constantly breaks up. had to go back to old cell phone and looking to purchase another phone. the two stars are for the shipping time and appearance.,2
"Purchased this product as new. Proximity sensor failed. Apple support told me this phone was purchased in 2011and had no factory warranty. Company will not do any replacement after 30 days, so beware. I have a phone that I cannot use for phone calls. I will not purchase from these people as they state the product is new, but it is not!,",1
Phone was brand new and worked great.. I also recieved it in 2 business days which was awesome because I paid for standard shipping..my only complaint is the price was a little ridiculous for an iPhone 4 so I'm rating the phone a 4,4
"Rated 1 Star because the description said GOOD quality, not an iPhone with a broken home button that doesn't work unless I jam it down. Will have to take to the Apple store for a fix, and could not return it to Amazon because of time constraints. Annoying.",1
"This phone came quickly! It said it was ""like new"" and it seemed completely new--had the plastic on the front, etc. It had no scratches, etc. We ordered this phone for my daughter and she was totally excited. This came from the Amazon Warehouse and I would certainly recommend ordering from them. It included the headphones which was great also.",5
"I wouldn't have minded buying a phone with a dysfunctional charger, but I would have liked to know what I was purchasing upfront. Luckily, the charger of the phone I'm switching fits this phone - if not, I'd be a very unhappy man with a new phone and no charger. I do want to say everything else was perfect, and I appreciate the price.",4
Great phone my son wanted a iPhone so I decided to go with the 4 until I know he can be responsible with it. Came the day it was suppose to unlocked no problem at all.,5
"This is my second one, and is really frustrating because i have to take it too have everything copied. I can hear other people on line, but they can not hear me sometimes.",1
I would have kept this phone had it they allowed me to have updates past 7.1. Now Apple has updates for Iphone 4 users. I say get it if you need a cheap go-to smartphone.,4
"Got the iphone a little bit early. They said it would be in perfect condition. Well the iphone came and I had to restore it. After I restored it, I tried to play music and one of the speakers doesn't work. The call volume is also very low. nobody can hear me forreal but I can hear them. it'll sound like my fone is breaking up.",2
"Got the phone ahead if schedule, in the condition they described! But when I went to set it up, it came back stolen. I just don't understand how someone can sale stolen products! How do you not know??",1
"I bought three of those iPhone as a gift. I know in the ads they said it is used.But they are in good quality, no cracks or any bad signs on any of them. The price was a bargain. I liked them so much that I placed another order for two more.Good communication with the seller too.ThanksOmaima",5
does not come in box that is bad not wash brings to insert the sim card and cash are not nuebo are usedotherwise and binding to and release for Latin America if it do not work,2
The phone looks nice and works but the home button you have to press hard sometime don't like that.Everything else work great. Still like check on YouTube on how to fix it hope that works.,3
Purchased it to use it as a secondary phone and it worked great. Now I only use it as a backup phone but I am glad I have a phone to go to in case of emergencies.,5
omg i am so happy i found this phone i had one and the on and off button quit working on me and i was searching amazon and found one just like it and i received it fast thankyou so very much for the fast shipping,5
"I got this for my son to get him started on the IPhone but without having to break the bank. It will last him a couple of years and then we can upgrade again. The product was brand new, works great and does everything he needs. The seller was prompt. It came right away.",4
I ordered this device on Wednesday and it arrived 2 days later. That was very unexpected. I got everything it said I would except for the headphones. But I'm ok with that because Apples headphones aren't that great. Overall. A great experience. I would definately buy again.,5
"My sons first smart phone and he loves it! The phone came in excellent condition. For the price and condition it's in, my wife and I consider the phone a steal!",5
"good items, the condition is good, working perfect, i apreciated that the description is real, the software is correct, the hardware is very aceptable, work fine great item dear seller!!! five start for your",5
"The phone works pretty well, but I have had to bypass a button that allows you to change screens because it was sticky and wouldn't always work. I was glad to see that the phone offered this option, must be a common issue with older phones.",4
"what can I say? I previously purchased an I phone from the AT&T. When I found out I had a $200 deductible to replace it, I got this one instead. Great phone. better price. Same phone.",5
I ordered a black 32gb iphone 4 but got white instead. Phone didn't look touched and was factory unlocked as needed. The phone is very buggy..im not sure if it's the software that unlocked it or if that's just the iphone's quality. Either way im happy knowing I can use any gsm carrier whenever and have plenty of memory to last till upgrade time.,4
"I ordered this phone, thinking it practically new, but it ended up not even being the phone I wanted. It was the iPhone 4 in White, and it had a crack in it. Also, the battery lifespan was no good. I'm using it because I have no other option, but hopefully someone will call the seller out on it next time.",3
Opyou are the first person i bought a iphone from! I love this when i got it it looked like it was brand new! Even though it had scratchs i cant get over it!,5
"This Iphone 4 was right out of the box ""new"", not a scratch on it. Works just as if I brought it from Best Buy or At&T. My son loves it ,and the price was a great. No problems what so ever.",5
"I'm OCD and the phone came with a scratch right through the light for the camera. It doesn't affect the picture quality, but amazon said it was a brand new phone! Brand new phones don't have scratches!",4
This is the worst phone I have ever purchased or seen in my life. The camera does not work! It freezes and won't let you take a picture. I even brought it in to be fixed and the guy laughed at me and told me to return it as soon as possible. He said he could not fix it and that I should get my money back! Heads up.. Don't buy this phone!,1
The mic of the earphone is not work. Just got it two days and the price is cheaper now. I like iPhone 4. Beautiful. Bit my SIM card is big one. How can I make it smaller,3
I bought my phone used as to avoid the 2 year contract and high prices of the major companies. We put the phone on Straight Talk and we are loving it.,5
I bought this used item though it doesn't look like used. Except that it has a minor scratch on the back which is unnoticeable. Device is working good but the charging cable looks like not the original one because it broke at the joint exposing the inner wire otherwise great product as expected.,4
"Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone.",3
This product worked great for my birthday gift for my teenage son! High quality and arrived right on time! I really saved a lot of money in comparison to getting this same item at the store.Recommend it to anyone that is looking for savings all the way around on not just time but $$$.Regina,5
Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine,5
Ordered for my son and he has been pleased with the phone. Bought a case for this one. :)Telephone was in good condition with no scratches. Actually better than the description.,5
"The phone looked to be in perfect shape. However after 2 weeks of use, phone calls seem to have lots of static then would automatically disconnect.Unable to hear or be heard. Very disappointed. In the process of getting a refund. No exchange was offered.",1
"If your an Apple customer you'll love it , just like new , no scratches or appearance of usage .Be sure to have your sim card ready for it ... Comes in box with all accessories needed.",4
Very upset with this product. It says its unlocked using Gevey sim which it is not. The phone i received had too new of a baseband to unlock. Had sratches on back too... Looks like i just bought a $350 paper weight until baseband can be unlocked..... what a SCAM,1
I love my phone. It came in the original packaging with all accessories. It was delivered when promised and was in the condition described. It was actually in better shape than I expected.,5
"I feel very good the whole process even today I have not received one month ago maybe by season, but all good thank god ..... just want to know if the iPhone is released internationally and if you send a code to unlock it.",4
I was showing the Iphone tu my nephew and then went blank and hot and no way to be turned of ... then it dies... I lost my money...I wish to have it back but how?>??/,1
"After a few minor issues, we managed to get things worked out., I thought I was buying an unlocked phone, it wasn't, however the seller payed to unlock it and my step-daughter is happy with her birthday present",4
"It's an iPhone, so it's easy and all that. I'm more rating the seller - I bought this used from Laptop Angels and it arrived 4 days earlier than expected and as of yet seems fully functional. Took it to ATT and it was unlocked and worked with my provider, as advertised. I've had no problems with it so far.",5
"The volume did not work at all, no one could hear me on a call and I could not hear from my end of the call. I was very disappointed because this was the second iphone I had to send back and a big waste of my time ...",1
Would recommend them to anyone. I washed them and they came out beautifully when I took them out of the dryer. You can tell they are high quality sheets.,5
"As discrived, on time, I contacted them, they crarified my concerns, and the phone works as I expected so far, Service was really good, the person was really great.",5
"SHIPPED A 16 GB WITH A FAKE PAPER PRINTED 32 GB LABLE WITH A BARCODE AND A IMEI NUMBER, TOOK IT TO APPLE AND CONFIRMED IT WAS A 16 GB, AND ATT CONFIRMED THE BARCODE WAS NOT THERES AS THEY DO NOT BARCODE THEIR PHONES THEY USE APPLES ORIGONAL, DO NOT BUY!!!",1
Product was in excellent condition. I ordered this to replace the not very user friendly android phone I had been using. I will never have anything but an iPhone from here on out.,5
"Its ok. Awsome. Is great for the price the only thing that was bad was the wall charger cube, it generated no charge just on and off. i had to charge the phone on a old charging dock station. Overall im satisfied. Will submit an update a review soon.",5
A lot of the apps that are out there now will not work with the older OS. The Iphone 4 is limited as to upgrades in OS as well. While I knew I was buying old technology I didn't realize that the apps were no longer available.,3
"this phone was sold as new worked for 3 mnths then stopped took it to the nearest apple store which was 3 hrs away for them to tell me it was a ""frankinstien"" meaning there were some apple parts an some that were not now NOBODY will help 300$ just gone",1
"It's not bad for the price, but there is lots of glitches in it! Another thing, it says it comes with a charger and it didn't! The only thing good about it is that it came quick!!",2
there were multiple issues with the phone that was supposed to be refurbished. this was the first product I purchased through here that I can say was a waste of money and I order a lot.,1
This is clearly the wrong phone and it would be excellent if whomever repackaged this actually looked at the box which clearly states VERIZON not what it was sold as AT&T. The irony here is these 2 different networks also use different carries AT&T is GSM and Verizon is CDMA. So this phone is a complete fail there too.,1
The phone in its self is amazing but the batteries messed up in both it won't stay charged for nothing and then you plug it in and I jumps the percent of the phone up like 10% like its not really dying,2
"Needed a replacement phone for my daughter This one made her very happy! Was received in as advertised condition. Fully functional. No noticeable scratches on screen, original plastic on back, and otterbox works great.",5
"I wrote a previous review about this phone. It was not a 32GB as listed, but a 16GB. It was not unlocked either. After contacting Amazon, they did all that was necessary to correct the problem along with a full upfront refund before receiving the phone back. Thank you to Amazon for their hard work in the customer service department.",5
"Battery lasted 6 months... do not recommend. This phone has a problem with the screen touch. Many times, it will not recognize I'm pressing a button on the screen. However, it will constantly think my ear is a button. It's VERY annoying!. I don't recommend buying this phone from this company.",1
"Second phone I have purchased from Amazon..., This one worked two weeks before freezing up. I read all the reviews and chose to try again but was disappointed for a second time. Our phones make or break our business so not having usage for an hour can impact our lives. Amazon has always faired well with every other purchase we have made.",2
Amazon hopes the sale of second-hand mobile phones to establish standards to limit certain unscrupulous businessmen shoddy second-hand mobile phones. I hope bad business to strictly enforce the Amazon proprietary standard used phones.,3
I placed an order for Iphone 4 AT&T lock and was delivered an IPHONE 4S Verizon Lock. I have travelled abroad therefore I can't return the IPHONE 4S Verizon Lock and latter I check for ESN and found that it had a BAD ESN. I am totally disappointed by this purchase. I am not able to replace this phone.,1
"LOVED the phone, until I realized that the home button did not work. Could not make it go ""home"" no matter what I did. Was easy to return and get money back, But will NOT buy from this seller again. Phone was suppose to be in very good condition, would HATE it see what condition a phone in ""good"" condition would be like.",1
"The iPhone 4 32 GB (Black) - AT&T was presented as ""Brand New"" and turned out to be NOT. An Apple store technician told me that it is a ""Frankenstein."" /ss",1
"the signal is super weak, the phone is out of signal most the time.The battery is ran out so quick and also the phone gets boiling hot just after 20 mins on calling.Often, the shop pauses by itself and you cannot return the home page.Definitely wasting my money on this phone !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"We haven't had much success with used apple products, but I decided to give it one more go. This phone is exactly as the seller described. It works beautifully. Most importantly, I have a very happy 15 year old whose iPhone 3 was seriously on it's last leg. Her favorite feature is facetime. :)",5
Phone did freeze and went completely black for hours but was still on contaced apple support to figure out why and they told me how to fix the issue hopefully it doesnt happen again the phone itself is in very good condition besides this incident,4
"I bought this phone 2 years ago and it worked perfectly fine but after a couple months of use the home button stopped working and eventually the lock button on top began to stick, I just sold this phone to buy a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 which is way better than this phone.",3
"I bought this phone and after a months of using it,it died on me i took it to the Apple store to have it fix and they told that my phone was faked...meaning amazon sell fake stuff for high prices.",1
"Small crack on body of device, not internal problems, software is fine,activated with no problems overall am very happy with my buy thank you so much.",4
I like the phone itself though when I first got it I had to do a software update. Also my charger base is already not working and needing to be replaced. It doesn't keep a charge for as long as I would like. It seems to take forever to charge via computer or in my vehicle.,3
I took the phone to Verizon store to transfer the info from my old phone to this new one. They couldn't because they said the phone wouldn't respond. Needless to say I had to return the phone and wait 4 weeks for my refund.,1
"The phone I bought was new but was so slow, the screen was dark even on the highest setting, and random things would pop up for sign in. Apps ran super slow, especially maps, and siri didn't even work.Worst phone I ever bought I returned. LISTEN TO ME don't buy this phone. You will regret.",1
Awesome buy! I appreciate the nice communication between seller and I. Phone is in great condition and also came with a case and phone charger! Thank you,5
"My aunt does not like it. Only the first owner of the phone can unlock it. In addition, it comes with a MEID number instead of IMEID which needs to be verified before using the phone. My aunt informs me that she is thinking of returning the phone.",2
"I purchased this phone in June 2014, and now October of 2014, not even 5 months later I have to have the button that turns it off and on replaced. Not a happy person!",1
"Very disappointed with this phone. The charger base never worked from day one. It has given me constant trouble. It even wiped out all my contacts, pictures, and texts. I will have to bring it to the Apple store to see if they can fix it.",1
"The phone didn't work..the sensor was broken so every time I tried to make a call it would continually dial. The battery was Also broken, the phone wouldn't keep a charge",1
VERY happy with my purchase!!! It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he adores it. Uses it every minute of the day! Thanks for a great product and super speedy delivery!,5
Very disappointed with purchase I'm having problems sending mail with the iPhone and now my iPad as well. The aol.com email doesn't send my email but I'm receiving my email to my email account! When I try to send a message it says that the password or the username is incorrect! Please help? Thank you!,1
I tried to turn it on and it had been rerouted. Ended up having to pay 50 dollars more and Verizon for another phone that had only 8gb so needless to say IM VERY PISSED AND DISAPPOINTED,1
"The phone is in perfect condition, it looked pretty much brand new! No scratches, no dents, no blemishes at all.The phone operates flawlessly. I am so happy with my purchase. Thank you so so much.",5
It's an iPhone- there's not too much more to say. It works great with all our other Apple products and the price was excellent for the large memory. I've been happy with it so far.,4
Everything is great. Phone works good no scratches or anything. All the buttons work ... Doesn't move slow (yet). But honestly I will buy phones like this from now on. 80 bucks you can't beat that.,5
"I ordered two of these phones. On both of them the home buttons do not work correctly, you have to push them multiple times to get them to work, and sometimes you can't get them to work at all. These were a complete waste of money. I would definitely stay away from these!",1
Made in China. Glitchy. Updated Sept 2016: phone wouldn't hold a charge then refused to turn on altogether. Glass is not iPhone glass. I have owned a couple.iphones and this one didn't seem like a legit one. It wasn't worth the $ at all.,1
The phone I bought completely went black and does not work at all. I took it to Apple and they said it was non repairable! I havent had the phone a full 30 days!,1
"I was unable to activate the phone with my provider. They told me that the phone had been reported stolen, and as a result when trying to activate it, Apple locked it down so it cannot be used as anything but a paper weight.",1
"my brother tell me to buy a Iphone i don't to buy it because i don't how to used it. My first time to buy a Iphone and i love to used it, it's awesome. if i have more money i buy the black one too.",5
"did my best to get in touch with you for a change of equipment, since I received the phone is cdma tegnologia, and does not work in Venezuela, my intention was to file a change for gsm team, but I found it impossible to get any type of response, should pay attention to the requirements of its customers.",1
"I like love my new Iphone, had an issue activating it at first cause the Verizob lady told me it was through US Cellular but I got it all taken care of.",5
I bought the phone and ship to Singapore.But I found that the phone cannot be used outside of US.I should take responsibility for the mistake.But the seller almost refund me all the payment.And save me a lot of lost.Thanks very much.,5
The charger didn't even fit into the iPhone has to be something wrong with this picture... And the headphone was not great too.. It was an iPhone 1 headphone while I got the iPhone 4. The iPhone was in great condition and liked it very much.,4
Was disappointed with the phone from day one . I dealt with it as I was due for an upgrade in a few months. I would not recommend buying a refurbished phone from anyone.,1
"I got a great price, and it arrived on time for Christmas. It actually arrived ahead of the promised date. My daughter, who received the phone as a gift is very happy with it.",5
"This phone doesn't pull as many reception bars as my black phone. It does most things except complete calls well. That's the trouble. What good is a phone that doesn't do its main job of completing phone calls well? And even though it was brand new, Apple said, ""It's from an outside vendor, and you're on your own.""Too bad.",2
At first I was almost sure I was going to get scammed because this was such a great deal! It works perfectly and I couldn't be more satisfied with my new iPhone 4. Love it! Thank you!,5
It is great althought my home button only works half the time and so i have to hit it several times to get back to my home screen from anywhere. Not good!,1
"I bought the 'Used - very good' condition. There were some slight scratch marks and some 'dirt' in the speaker slots and other cavities. Other than that, I've had it for almost 2 months now and no issues so far.",4
"I purchased this phone for use overseas, only to learn AFTER I received it that there wasn't a GSM Chip Slot. I currently use an iPhone 4 and it does have the GSM Slot, I had no idea the newer ones or from Verizon did not.I will now have to try and sell this item and get one GSM ready.Gary",3
I bought the phone it looks great no scratches nothing it was a used phone the only problem was the batterie dies in about an hour and sometimes doesn't even turn back on it takes about 30 minutes. I tried contacting amazon and they told me to check with apple but apple didn't do anything.,3
"Mine was listed as ""Used"" and in ""Good"" condition. What arrived was a factory new phone that had the shrink wrap removed the box so it could be sold as ""used"". I can't say that you will receive the same but I am very happy with mine!",5
I received the iphone in good condition. The problem I had was that I could not capitalize any words which was a problem. Other than that the phone was as advertised. I returned the phone without any hassles and received a prompt refund.,2
its like a brand new iphone 4s sans the box. Arrived promptly. There was a sticker on the bubble wrap covering the phone stating it was an 8 GB phone so for a bit I thought I had been duped. But then checked the iphone memory and it is indeed a 32 GB.Very pleased!!!!!,5
"Due to a number of factors I decided to downgrade from an iPhone 5 to an iPhone 4 - wish I wouldn't have done that. The service, delivery and price was good but the phone was certainly a step down.",3
"Not only was this phone everything I expected, it came earlier than projected!! This was a great buying experience and I would use this merchant again for any similar purchase.",5
"I was worried about purchasing this phone due to the other reviews I read, however it came brand new as promised. Everything works well except for the speaker phone. I don't ever really use it so its not a huge deal.",5
Have had it for a year and it is still going strong. I am getting the new Iphone 6 though. Sometimes the home button doesn't work but that never has bothered me.,5
"Thank you so much Amazon, and FedEx without the both of you joining forces I would not have had my day made by receiving my package from coast-to-coast in less than 24 hours. This is beyond exceptionally outstanding work. And I am very pleased, thank you once again very much.",5
It's great! It arrived way before it said it would its brand new (until I dropped it and the back spiderwebbed :( but the front didn't break!) great overall experience :),5
"I was told I was buying a new phone, not a refurbished one. Very upsetting, but it works mostly well. It goes a little crazy when I put the phone in silent mode and the head jack input was dirty (also works mostly well). But I afraid that this phone won't last. I guess if you want new you should buy straight from apple.",1
"I had to return this product as it was not the one I was looking for ! It was ordered accidentally ,I needed GSM instead of CDMA.I face difficulty in returning this product but thanks to Amazon customer service which supported me well.",3
"Ok delivery was very speedy 4-5 days...!! Phone was in great condition physically. The camera was damaged tho. Flash was no good! Overall, i didnt get what i ordered; which was an unlocked sim card enabled device, therfore i had to return it asap.:(",4
"I bought this iPhone 4, It is in new condition. It arrived promptly. Excellent seller. now I am looking for someone to unlock this great phone here in Venezuela!!!!!!",5
This 32gb iphone let's me download what I want I don't have to keep seeing how much space I have left because I know I have more than enough on board and the phone is in good condition! Love it,5
Camera looks like I was standing in a cloud of smoke. I loved the camera on my old phone but this one is completely useless. I wouldn't buy another used phone ever.,1
"While the phone was as described, it was not 'unlocked' as was touted. It was locked to AT&T. I had to pay to get it usable in my part of the globe. I would buy from this seller again.",5
"Yes I Have now. All is perfect, but I made a mistake, that cellphone is CDMA and in my contry does not work, but is may fault. Any way is perfect . I am going to buy something called gmate and with that is going to workl here.",3
"Phone came in great condition, looks brand new! Activated without problems and is the 32gb as ordered. Came in the box with the charger and headphones. Snapchat is acting a little funny and the emoji keyboard but other than that no problems at all. Verizon said I got a great deal!",4
Was brand new in all the apple packaging complete with headphones and a charger. Was exactly as described by the seller. Extremely happy with this purchase. Great price especially now that apple has stopped producing 32 GB iPhone 4 and most cell services don't sell them.,5
"the phone was said to be fully functional, I quote ""The device is tested & 100% fully functional"". but the camera does not work and that is one of the main reasons I bought this phone. the seller should've mentioned that the camera is bogus. Very disappointed!!!!",2
When I order the phone I had mixed reaction when I look at the reviews but when I gotten the iPhone all those fears were put to rest cause it works great,5
i normally get great products from warehouse deals but some reason this time i got the phone and when i stuck the headsets in the phone couldnt hear a thing. got new headsets and it still didnt work,3
This used iphone 4 was in ridiculously great condition. The price was similar or better than other used or refurbished iphones with less GB storage. My teenage son was getting this as a replacement phone until our contract is up for renewal and he can get a new one. Now he's not sure he wants a new one.,5
Wasn't able to activate it the phone is still under someone else contract so it was useless . Had to return . Still waiting on my refund. Please make sure esn is clean before u sell another,1
"This is definitely not a new phone as the original posting had stated. Sure, the phone looked new when I got it, but it only lasted me about 4 months before the battery started draining and dying at 40%. Not to mention the super lag that came with it. Do not buy this! What a scam.",1
"32 gigs is an awful lot for a guy who only sends about twenty or so emails a month and receives back less. Phone works great, but my wife's 8 gig one is just enough",5
I was very impressed with the service and quality of the product I received. The product was shipped immediately and I received it before the expected date. The phone was in perfect (new) condition and I have had no problems with it at all. Activating it was a breeze. I would suggest this seller to anybody!,5
"Arrived early. Exactly as described. One tiny bubble on the edge of the screen, but nothing I would complain about. Overall It's a good phone and new.",4
"Worked very well, no scratches. Only one side of the speakers worked but for the price it was great. It was glitchy here & there but it only happened every so often that it wasn't really a problem. Restarted the phone & it was fine. Overall great product & great price. Would recommend.",5
"This was the best iPhone Apple ever had til the IPhone 6S Plus came out. I had my iPhone 4 for many years and never had a problem with it...easy to learn iOS, clear calling, hundreds of thousand apps to try in the App Store...If this is your first iPhone purchase and don't want anything big then this the best phone.",5
The phone I bought through Amazon was stolen. When I went to have it activated at the Verizon store the sales clerk told me it had been reported stolen. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Amazon. How disappointing! I have not bought one single electronic item from Amazon since and may not in the future due to this experience.,1
"I love this phone I was super excited to get this phone, I lost my ipod touch and didn't and decided to get an iphone instead of replacing the ipod. That was one of my best decisions. I would recommend this product to any and everyone.",5
"Well for one thing i didn't get a new one and when i did get it, it had a very volgure e-mail left on it (rapepornog ) what the rest was i can't remeber, and there was still some chinese writing left on it, i was lucky to get it off, so i really do think ALL THE PHONES SHOOULD BE LOOKED OVER A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THEY ARE??????????",4
Tried to activate this phone and it would not due to the fact that it was a AT & T phone. I would suggest the owner or company of this phone change the title description.,1
"when i ordered I thougth that is going to look used, but when i got it. was wrap it as new and when i open it, was perfect clean like a new i i ordered used, and since i buyed is working perfecly.",5
"This item was exactly as advertised-in perfect condition, no scratches, and works perfectly. I intended to buy a 4S, but the 4 is great and Siri is not really necessary.",5
Very good....no scratches at all. I love it but the only problem I am facing is a message popping up and say your phone can not be activated however I see the Verizon network. That's funny.,4
Phone works really well. I had to take to Verizon store to have activated. However I was expecting a 32gb and only received a16gb so that was disappointing.,3
Great deal on this phone. I took a big chance and had a lot of doubt. The phone arrived on excellent condition and for the price this was a great deal. Thank you',4
"I received the cell phone really quickly and ive been using it since... its a little sluggish at times but its managable but the one thing that pissed me off about it is that the sound only comes out of one of the speakers and at one time, the sound wasn't even working. literally have to slam the phone on the back then the sound came back on.....",3
bluetooth doesnt workits a tad glitchy now and thencharging is a tad spotty and slow at timesit can get really laggybut i can live with all these things; it was a great price!,4
"I purchased this to replace my son's stolen iphone. This phone arrived quickly, brand new in original packaging. It is working very well on our Verizon network. We are well pleased.",5
It's been a year & this phone still runs great with a good battery. The unlocked version is perfect for people who switch plans a lot. A great purchase for anyone deciding on using an iPhone.,5
"I had previously bought an iPhone 4 from a different seller, which had turned out to be defective. This one was cheater and works like a charm! Amazing!",5
"I thought I was buying what was listed. But I received a different GB of phone than I had paid for. She did pay me the difference of the item I got and what I had originally paid for. But I am still upset because that's not what I wanted, and the phone wasn't unlocked.",1
"I was scared i would have gotten an iphone that was cracked with scratches or something, but when it arrived it looked brand new like no one has ever used it. I was very impressed!(: i love the phone, so glad i ordered it, everything came with it. it was a great price too! (:",5
"Add more description to the phone because when i had received mine the home button had some problems and did not want to work sometimes. also with the phone speakers, i am a person of music i like to always listen to music but when the speakers do not work fully it disappointed me. overall the phone was a great buy and i really enjoy it",3
"I'm in Guangzhou, China received Iphone4 32GB, overall is very good. Is the screen and border wear more often, it was a very good deal. Using Chinese telecommunications services.",4
Has decent functions but very slow phone. And there is no option to make it to where when on phone calls the screen closes or locks so your face make you push buttons constantly or you conference in other calls. That's a major disappointment always have to use speaker I you don't want that to happen.,2
"Item came just as expected, and was well packed. I had to return mine, though, because the friend I got it for got a new phone the day after it arrived.",5
"Worked very well, no scratches. Only one side of the speakers worked but for the price it was great. It was glitchy here & there but it only happened every so often that it wasn't really a problem. Restarted the phone & it was fine. Overall great product & great price. Would recommend.",5
"First I want to say that I purchased this new, through Amazon. The phone was as described, new and with all the accessories. Had no trouble activating it with Verizon and I am very happy with the purchase. It is a good basic i phone at a fair price!",5
this iphone was okay but I found out before sending the product back that it doesn't have siri or even facetime. I sent it back right away without opening the box.,5
"this was advertised as New in package. the phone was received with a defect in the screen (shaking icons). after contacting apple, the unit was identified as a ""refurbished"" phone. ""refurbished"" does NOT equal NEW.",1
Perfect! Very pleased! It was listed as like new and was indeed in new condition. The phone is working great (on Net10) and no regrets on this purchase!,5
"This phone doesn't pull as many reception bars as my black phone. It does most things except complete calls well. That's the trouble. What good is a phone that doesn't do its main job of completing phone calls well? And even though it was brand new, Apple said, ""It's from an outside vendor, and you're on your own.""Too bad.",2

The screen went black after 2weeks of use. I have tried everything and it want come on. This is the second phone i have purchased off of here and they never work over 2weeks.,1
"Just like new for a fraction of the price. My daughter loves it, she uses it all day and night. I would recomend an otter box case they pay for them selves in no time.",4
So far no problems as of yet did find local store n in Columbus ohio where I could buy brand new for 150.00 wish I knew before hand to save the extra money will look around next time,1
"I was about to buy this phone same phone for about 70 bucks more for new out of the box. Saw the same phone in the warehouse section with the Amazon guarantee. So glad i got the warehouse deal. Phone came with a charger like new, no i phone box but who cares.",5
"I ordered an iPhone 4 32GB and they sent an 8GB iPhone, was not what i ordered. Let for a trip and had to have someone else send a phone to my address in Florida while trying to work. Total disaster.",1
this product is great so far bought it for Christmas so don't know how long it will last but the price you cant beat and always amazon is great so well pleased,5
My granddaughter is thrilled with the phone which she will use until the family plan is qualified for renewal and then move up to the latest iPhone available at the time!,5
"This phone was a lemon. It looked great when it arrived, but the battery was near death, and after a few days the Home Button stopped working. The screen wouldn't react to tough, either. It was a very frustrating ordeal. I hope they don't turn around and pass it off onto someone else.It's time to through that baby away.",1
My daughter wanted a iPhone for Christmas! Found this one Cyber Monday for a GREAT deal with all the accessories brand new in the box. Phone works great,5
"Phone was delivered promptly. I was worried that phone may be used or wouldn't connect with Verizon. Phone appears to be new and I had no problems connecting with Verizon. I have issues with several apps, but I don't consider that the seller's fault. Phone won't download entire I-tunes library and the maps doesn't have a voice feature. .",4
Works like an absolute charm. The seller got this too me EXTREMELY speedy and was extremely nice. Never ever had any problem with it and I've had it for almost 2 months now. Works beautifully.,5
VERY happy with my purchase!!! It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he adores it. Uses it every minute of the day! Thanks for a great product and super speedy delivery!,5
Very disappointed with purchase I'm having problems sending mail with the iPhone and now my iPad as well. The aol.com email doesn't send my email but I'm receiving my email to my email account! When I try to send a message it says that the password or the username is incorrect! Please help? Thank you!,1
With any used item that you purchase you're taking a chance but with this item it's in really good shape other than the home button is non responsive at times. Overall it's a good purchase..,4
"It was no clear for us whose first language is not English the description of the cell. It is impossible to use it here in Brazil ans mt purychase, mt money was lost. I wrote a message for you, but there wasn't any answer. So, sadly, it was my first and my last purchase.Sibcerely yiurs,Denise Batista da Luz",1
"My only issue is that the volume keys stopped working after a couple weeks. Not necessarily caused by seller, but annoying to have to turn the volume up and down on the screen only.",4

"My aunt does not like it. Only the first owner of the phone can unlock it. In addition, it comes with a MEID number instead of IMEID which needs to be verified before using the phone. My aunt informs me that she is thinking of returning the phone.",2
"I purchased this phone in June 2014, and now October of 2014, not even 5 months later I have to have the button that turns it off and on replaced. Not a happy person!",1
"Very disappointed with this phone. The charger base never worked from day one. It has given me constant trouble. It even wiped out all my contacts, pictures, and texts. I will have to bring it to the Apple store to see if they can fix it.",1
"The phone didn't work..the sensor was broken so every time I tried to make a call it would continually dial. The battery was Also broken, the phone wouldn't keep a charge",1
"Love it - just like the one I drowned. I neethrohded the memory for my music and all and none of the 5's available through Verizon has 32 gig. I could have upgraded with them but I do not like the 5's taller, narrower style so I went with what I had and enjoyed. Happy camper.",5
Very unhappy! It clearly says its a WHITE iPhone and i got a pink one! It was crajed front and back and to top it off the camera didnt work! Ver very unhappy!,1

"When I got I I knew it would be used, that's why I didn't mind the small scratches on the screen. The only thing that pissed my off is that I was not told that one of the speakers wouldn't work. And then the headphones( don't know if they were new or not) just stopes working for me",2
"Shipped quick, great phone, only 3 starts because my microphone did not work unless its on speaker. Kinda stuck on weather to send it back and be without a phone for 2 weeks and go through reactivate or just get a blue tooth device and not even have to use it.",3

"the phone was said to be fully functional, I quote ""The device is tested & 100% fully functional"". but the camera does not work and that is one of the main reasons I bought this phone. the seller should've mentioned that the camera is bogus. Very disappointed!!!!",2
When I order the phone I had mixed reaction when I look at the reviews but when I gotten the iPhone all those fears were put to rest cause it works great,5
i normally get great products from warehouse deals but some reason this time i got the phone and when i stuck the headsets in the phone couldnt hear a thing. got new headsets and it still didnt work,3
On amazon the say that the phone is 32GB and the bring me an iphone 16Gb and the back camera is not good and its not a gsm phone. I work hard to have money...,1
"I purchased this phone after having my iPhone 5S in gold stolen, and it may as well be the same phone (minus the fingerprint accesory). It was used, and you could tell but there was nothing seriously wrong with it. It came with all the accessories like the charger, headphones, etc. It definitely works well and was a huge life saver! Great buy.",4
This is a grest sight.The prouduct comes fast and is in good shape.A great sight.And I love the low prices!!!!!This is a great sight and I reccomend it to everyone.,5
"Great phone, fast and timely shipping. the only downside to this product was that when i got it, the lock button stuck so i have to press really hard to get it to lock and unlock.",3
"this iphone is like having a hand held computer, it is my kindle, my ipod, my ipad, my TV, my camera, my facebook, my everything my notebook-PC has. I can't say enough good about my iphone I will never have a different brand it is forever iphones for me!",5
"Ordered this for my Dad several months ago and he is very happy with the phone. It looked brand new, activated right away, and we have had no problems with it. Thanks Joycells.. Good value!",5
"Has some home button issues that will not be taken care of by Apple...that's a fallacy on refurbished phones. However, it works great, looks great, and does what it is supposed.",3
"My aunt does not like it. Only the first owner of the phone can unlock it. In addition, it comes with a MEID number instead of IMEID which needs to be verified before using the phone. My aunt informs me that she is thinking of returning the phone.",2
"I received the cell phone really quickly and ive been using it since... its a little sluggish at times but its managable but the one thing that pissed me off about it is that the sound only comes out of one of the speakers and at one time, the sound wasn't even working. literally have to slam the phone on the back then the sound came back on.....",3
bluetooth doesnt workits a tad glitchy now and thencharging is a tad spotty and slow at timesit can get really laggybut i can live with all these things; it was a great price!,4
The screen went black after 2weeks of use. I have tried everything and it want come on. This is the second phone i have purchased off of here and they never work over 2weeks.,1
"Just like new for a fraction of the price. My daughter loves it, she uses it all day and night. I would recomend an otter box case they pay for them selves in no time.",4
So far no problems as of yet did find local store n in Columbus ohio where I could buy brand new for 150.00 wish I knew before hand to save the extra money will look around next time,1
"I was about to buy this phone same phone for about 70 bucks more for new out of the box. Saw the same phone in the warehouse section with the Amazon guarantee. So glad i got the warehouse deal. Phone came with a charger like new, no i phone box but who cares.",5
"I ordered an iPhone 4 32GB and they sent an 8GB iPhone, was not what i ordered. Let for a trip and had to have someone else send a phone to my address in Florida while trying to work. Total disaster.",1
"I ordered two of these phones. On both of them the home buttons do not work correctly, you have to push them multiple times to get them to work, and sometimes you can't get them to work at all. These were a complete waste of money. I would definitely stay away from these!",1
Made in China. Glitchy. Updated Sept 2016: phone wouldn't hold a charge then refused to turn on altogether. Glass is not iPhone glass. I have owned a couple.iphones and this one didn't seem like a legit one. It wasn't worth the $ at all.,1
The phone I bought completely went black and does not work at all. I took it to Apple and they said it was non repairable! I havent had the phone a full 30 days!,1
This used iphone 4 was in ridiculously great condition. The price was similar or better than other used or refurbished iphones with less GB storage. My teenage son was getting this as a replacement phone until our contract is up for renewal and he can get a new one. Now he's not sure he wants a new one.,5
Wasn't able to activate it the phone is still under someone else contract so it was useless . Had to return . Still waiting on my refund. Please make sure esn is clean before u sell another,1
"This is definitely not a new phone as the original posting had stated. Sure, the phone looked new when I got it, but it only lasted me about 4 months before the battery started draining and dying at 40%. Not to mention the super lag that came with it. Do not buy this! What a scam.",1
"IT IS A CDMA PHONE THAT DOES WORK HERE IN THE BAHAMAS, I AM SO PISSED AT THIS PURCHASE! NEVER AGAIN WILL I DO THIS EVER! SO THE PHONEIS WORTHLESS HERE!",2
"I thought I was buying what was listed. But I received a different GB of phone than I had paid for. She did pay me the difference of the item I got and what I had originally paid for. But I am still upset because that's not what I wanted, and the phone wasn't unlocked.",1
"I was scared i would have gotten an iphone that was cracked with scratches or something, but when it arrived it looked brand new like no one has ever used it. I was very impressed!(: i love the phone, so glad i ordered it, everything came with it. it was a great price too! (:",5
"Add more description to the phone because when i had received mine the home button had some problems and did not want to work sometimes. also with the phone speakers, i am a person of music i like to always listen to music but when the speakers do not work fully it disappointed me. overall the phone was a great buy and i really enjoy it",3
"I'm in Guangzhou, China received Iphone4 32GB, overall is very good. Is the screen and border wear more often, it was a very good deal. Using Chinese telecommunications services.",4
"First I want to say that I purchased this new, through Amazon. The phone was as described, new and with all the accessories. Had no trouble activating it with Verizon and I am very happy with the purchase. It is a good basic i phone at a fair price!",5
this iphone was okay but I found out before sending the product back that it doesn't have siri or even facetime. I sent it back right away without opening the box.,5
Very good....no scratches at all. I love it but the only problem I am facing is a message popping up and say your phone can not be activated however I see the Verizon network. That's funny.,4
Phone works really well. I had to take to Verizon store to have activated. However I was expecting a 32gb and only received a16gb so that was disappointing.,3
Great deal on this phone. I took a big chance and had a lot of doubt. The phone arrived on excellent condition and for the price this was a great deal. Thank you',4
"Arrived early. Exactly as described. One tiny bubble on the edge of the screen, but nothing I would complain about. Overall It's a good phone and new.",4
"32 gigs is an awful lot for a guy who only sends about twenty or so emails a month and receives back less. Phone works great, but my wife's 8 gig one is just enough",5
I was very impressed with the service and quality of the product I received. The product was shipped immediately and I received it before the expected date. The phone was in perfect (new) condition and I have had no problems with it at all. Activating it was a breeze. I would suggest this seller to anybody!,5
"my brother tell me to buy a Iphone i don't to buy it because i don't how to used it. My first time to buy a Iphone and i love to used it, it's awesome. if i have more money i buy the black one too.",5
VERY happy with my purchase!!! It was a Christmas gift for my husband and he adores it. Uses it every minute of the day! Thanks for a great product and super speedy delivery!,5
Very disappointed with purchase I'm having problems sending mail with the iPhone and now my iPad as well. The aol.com email doesn't send my email but I'm receiving my email to my email account! When I try to send a message it says that the password or the username is incorrect! Please help? Thank you!,1
"Small crack on body of device, not internal problems, software is fine,activated with no problems overall am very happy with my buy thank you so much.",4
I received the iphone in good condition. The problem I had was that I could not capitalize any words which was a problem. Other than that the phone was as advertised. I returned the phone without any hassles and received a prompt refund.,2
its like a brand new iphone 4s sans the box. Arrived promptly. There was a sticker on the bubble wrap covering the phone stating it was an 8 GB phone so for a bit I thought I had been duped. But then checked the iphone memory and it is indeed a 32 GB.Very pleased!!!!!,5
"Due to a number of factors I decided to downgrade from an iPhone 5 to an iPhone 4 - wish I wouldn't have done that. The service, delivery and price was good but the phone was certainly a step down.",3
"Not only was this phone everything I expected, it came earlier than projected!! This was a great buying experience and I would use this merchant again for any similar purchase.",5
"I was worried about purchasing this phone due to the other reviews I read, however it came brand new as promised. Everything works well except for the speaker phone. I don't ever really use it so its not a huge deal.",5
"I purchased this to replace my son's stolen iphone. This phone arrived quickly, brand new in original packaging. It is working very well on our Verizon network. We are well pleased.",5
It's been a year & this phone still runs great with a good battery. The unlocked version is perfect for people who switch plans a lot. A great purchase for anyone deciding on using an iPhone.,5
"I had previously bought an iPhone 4 from a different seller, which had turned out to be defective. This one was cheater and works like a charm! Amazing!",5
"Great experience, I got a brand new iPhone 4 32gb. For verizon in the original sealed box with everything that it comes with(OH DID I MENTION IT CAME 3 DAYS EARLIER THAN EXPECTED) SUPER HAPPY WITH THIS SELLERI will buy my future electronics from just incase",5
phone stopped working after a month.. very disappointed with phone. speakers barely worked from the beginning. cant operate phone unless on speakerphone,1
It' great I just did not realize that I got a 4 i thought it was a 4's but my bad.But the phone has been great the only problem I have with it is the volume is very low and I away mute the phone when I'm talking on it.,5
"Having held out until recently T&P purchase new phone, this model of iPhone has been an outstanding purchase. User friendly as training video clips explain function from name persrectives.",5
"Mine was listed as ""Used"" and in ""Good"" condition. What arrived was a factory new phone that had the shrink wrap removed the box so it could be sold as ""used"". I can't say that you will receive the same but I am very happy with mine!",5
"I had to return this product as it was not the one I was looking for ! It was ordered accidentally ,I needed GSM instead of CDMA.I face difficulty in returning this product but thanks to Amazon customer service which supported me well.",3
"Ok delivery was very speedy 4-5 days...!! Phone was in great condition physically. The camera was damaged tho. Flash was no good! Overall, i didnt get what i ordered; which was an unlocked sim card enabled device, therfore i had to return it asap.:(",4
"I bought this iPhone 4, It is in new condition. It arrived promptly. Excellent seller. now I am looking for someone to unlock this great phone here in Venezuela!!!!!!",5
This 32gb iphone let's me download what I want I don't have to keep seeing how much space I have left because I know I have more than enough on board and the phone is in good condition! Love it,5
Camera looks like I was standing in a cloud of smoke. I loved the camera on my old phone but this one is completely useless. I wouldn't buy another used phone ever.,1
"While the phone was as described, it was not 'unlocked' as was touted. It was locked to AT&T. I had to pay to get it usable in my part of the globe. I would buy from this seller again.",5
This Device works fine on some days but then won't work at all on others. The speaker seems to go out a lot and more frequently now since it has been used for a month now?,3
"An iPhone that was current but inexpensive. Good price, good product, Excellent condition .Super fast shipping.I am very pleased to deal with you.Thanks..",5
I had to send my first phone back after only having it for 2 weeks....the home button stopped working. got my 2nd phone right away but now I am having a problem with the turn on/off button. Whats the deal with these phones?,1
I like the phone itself though when I first got it I had to do a software update. Also my charger base is already not working and needing to be replaced. It doesn't keep a charge for as long as I would like. It seems to take forever to charge via computer or in my vehicle.,3
I took the phone to Verizon store to transfer the info from my old phone to this new one. They couldn't because they said the phone wouldn't respond. Needless to say I had to return the phone and wait 4 weeks for my refund.,1
"The phone I bought was new but was so slow, the screen was dark even on the highest setting, and random things would pop up for sign in. Apps ran super slow, especially maps, and siri didn't even work.Worst phone I ever bought I returned. LISTEN TO ME don't buy this phone. You will regret.",1
"Phone came in great condition, looks brand new! Activated without problems and is the 32gb as ordered. Came in the box with the charger and headphones. Snapchat is acting a little funny and the emoji keyboard but other than that no problems at all. Verizon said I got a great deal!",4
"I was unable to activate the phone with my provider. They told me that the phone had been reported stolen, and as a result when trying to activate it, Apple locked it down so it cannot be used as anything but a paper weight.",1
"i have insurance with my service provider and i still had to cuff up $180 for a replacement phone, no thanks.but this the day before and got it the next day, for only $120 with 4 times the memory!!!!",5
The iphone is really good. it was in great condition it even included earphones and a charger. Everything works fine. It was delivered sooner than what i anticipated.,5
"Everything works but the main button to get thru the many screens doesn't work. Had it checked out by a repair shop and it sticks. For the price, I am satisfied.",3
The phone I bought through Amazon was stolen. When I went to have it activated at the Verizon store the sales clerk told me it had been reported stolen. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Amazon. How disappointing! I have not bought one single electronic item from Amazon since and may not in the future due to this experience.,1
"I love this phone I was super excited to get this phone, I lost my ipod touch and didn't and decided to get an iphone instead of replacing the ipod. That was one of my best decisions. I would recommend this product to any and everyone.",5
"Well for one thing i didn't get a new one and when i did get it, it had a very volgure e-mail left on it (rapepornog ) what the rest was i can't remeber, and there was still some chinese writing left on it, i was lucky to get it off, so i really do think ALL THE PHONES SHOOULD BE LOOKED OVER A WHOLE LOT BETTER THAN THEY ARE??????????",4
Tried to activate this phone and it would not due to the fact that it was a AT & T phone. I would suggest the owner or company of this phone change the title description.,1
"when i ordered I thougth that is going to look used, but when i got it. was wrap it as new and when i open it, was perfect clean like a new i i ordered used, and since i buyed is working perfecly.",5
"This item was exactly as advertised-in perfect condition, no scratches, and works perfectly. I intended to buy a 4S, but the 4 is great and Siri is not really necessary.",5
Was disappointed with the phone from day one . I dealt with it as I was due for an upgrade in a few months. I would not recommend buying a refurbished phone from anyone.,1
It's an iPhone- there's not too much more to say. It works great with all our other Apple products and the price was excellent for the large memory. I've been happy with it so far.,4
Everything is great. Phone works good no scratches or anything. All the buttons work ... Doesn't move slow (yet). But honestly I will buy phones like this from now on. 80 bucks you can't beat that.,5
"this was advertised as New in package. the phone was received with a defect in the screen (shaking icons). after contacting apple, the unit was identified as a ""refurbished"" phone. ""refurbished"" does NOT equal NEW.",1
Perfect! Very pleased! It was listed as like new and was indeed in new condition. The phone is working great (on Net10) and no regrets on this purchase!,5
Awesome buy! I appreciate the nice communication between seller and I. Phone is in great condition and also came with a case and phone charger! Thank you,5
"I purchased this phone in June 2014, and now October of 2014, not even 5 months later I have to have the button that turns it off and on replaced. Not a happy person!",1
"Very disappointed with this phone. The charger base never worked from day one. It has given me constant trouble. It even wiped out all my contacts, pictures, and texts. I will have to bring it to the Apple store to see if they can fix it.",1
"The phone didn't work..the sensor was broken so every time I tried to make a call it would continually dial. The battery was Also broken, the phone wouldn't keep a charge",1
this product is great so far bought it for Christmas so don't know how long it will last but the price you cant beat and always amazon is great so well pleased,5
My granddaughter is thrilled with the phone which she will use until the family plan is qualified for renewal and then move up to the latest iPhone available at the time!,5
"This phone was a lemon. It looked great when it arrived, but the battery was near death, and after a few days the Home Button stopped working. The screen wouldn't react to tough, either. It was a very frustrating ordeal. I hope they don't turn around and pass it off onto someone else.It's time to through that baby away.",1
My daughter wanted a iPhone for Christmas! Found this one Cyber Monday for a GREAT deal with all the accessories brand new in the box. Phone works great,5
"Phone was delivered promptly. I was worried that phone may be used or wouldn't connect with Verizon. Phone appears to be new and I had no problems connecting with Verizon. I have issues with several apps, but I don't consider that the seller's fault. Phone won't download entire I-tunes library and the maps doesn't have a voice feature. .",4
Works like an absolute charm. The seller got this too me EXTREMELY speedy and was extremely nice. Never ever had any problem with it and I've had it for almost 2 months now. Works beautifully.,5
"I was completely happy with my purchase of the iphone 4s, until last week i woke up one morning and it wouldn't turn on. I've taken it to att and bought new apple chargers and adapters, nothing is wrong with it. No water damage, no damage to charger port or entry either.",1
"This iphone is wonderful, and I saved a lot buying from this vendor. Delivered quickly and works fine! I uploaded all my ""stuff"" from iphone 3 in a jiffy with no snags or problems.",5
It's good. Shipping is soon. The customer service is excellent.Prompt delivery. everything came as described and now my phone works and it didn't cost me a fortune or a new phone.,5
"I recieved my Iphone4 in the mail and was so excited to see that it was practically brand new. No scratches, no visible defects just like as the description said. I love it and I would order again from the seller!",5
"I was completely happy with my purchase of the iphone 4s, until last week i woke up one morning and it wouldn't turn on. I've taken it to att and bought new apple chargers and adapters, nothing is wrong with it. No water damage, no damage to charger port or entry either.",1
I asked several questions to the person an he was nice and had manners fully answering any question I had. when I placed the order he instantly sent it. and my iphone is brand new and is exactly as what he said it was. there needs to be more honest sellers like this one.,5
I thought I was going to get a new phone or at least like new. But I received a used phone with scratches all over. and didn't get box and any other accessories.,1
These phones were purchased for someone and his girlfriend.They are happy with the phones.They chose this phone for it`s size and function.They wanted a phone to fit comfortably in the pocket.,5
"good iPhone 4, 8GB - Factory Unlocked. works good and looks great. with complete box and adapter, headphone. no scratches.All in all. worth to buy. With original clear film.",5
"Completely unlockec new phone. Pretty good though seems a bit slow. But if you consider doing only basic phone functions and chats, then shouldnt face troubles.",5
The attention was excellent! The phone had everything I expected and more. What I liked the most were the wishes that the seller dedicated a few minutes to write some Christmas wishes to me. It was an amazing experience.,5
"Purchased this iphone for my youngest son's birthday---it came in a timely manner and came in very good/new condition. Everything worked fine and we are very satisfied with the purchase, especially my teenage son!",5
The iPhone is only unlocked if you're a current or former AT&T customer. I'm not so I now have to return the phone. The product description did not specify.,1
"To make any purchase in Amazon is something very serious. Tha's why I personally trust on this enterprise. The main reason I choose this rate is because I feel satisfied with the item I bought. So that, I recommend to deal with Amazon.Alfredo",5
"I buy this product brand new, but the phone has come up with some stripes , when i take videos the sound doesnt record, its a possible to change the iphone?",2
Very unhappy. Item does not appear to be unlocked and cannot be used with any carrier except Verizon and decription says cannot be used with Verizon no chager for item just disappointed is all. Also was told this perticular Iphone model was made for Verizon only,1
"It is stop working after 40 days of purchase. It was seems very good in the first month, however, stop working after passed the return period. I don't recommend this cell phone for some body else. If you buy this item, consider you put your money(>$200) on the trash can.",1
Do not buy this phone from anyone but Apple themselves. The shipping took longer then expected and only aftter an hour of turning it one it stopped working. I call amazon directly after for a refund.,1
The phone itself was in great condition upon arrival. I bought used but the advertisement was for FACTORY UNLOCKED. It wasn't and I consider it a fraudulent claim. If you are gonna buy anything from these people just realize you are only paying for the price not the actual condition in which they say it will be,2
"Purchased this iphone for my youngest son's birthday---it came in a timely manner and came in very good/new condition. Everything worked fine and we are very satisfied with the purchase, especially my teenage son!",5
I was very pleased with the purchase. The phone was everything that it said and works great. It was clean and not scratched at all. This is how it was advertised and I am very happy.:),5
Hi I really like my iPhone 4 so far it's everything I expected it to be....Great...it does everything that is stated it would ....I have wanted on for awhile...even tried the Galaxy note ...I like this better...but that's just my feelings...,5
I had screws that were missing to the bottom of my phone to hold it and when I ask for then they said they will ship it but never did that was a month ago,1
"This phone was beautiful, worked well. However it did not work with my carrier, simple mobile. And I was disappointed. However, the sellers were understanding and helped me a lot. They shipped fast, and when I had to return it they took it back and gave me my refund quickly. Great people :) thanks and God bless!",4
"Esta en excelentes condiciones como si fuese nuevo, sin ningún detalle. Recomiendo este vendedor, sus artículos llegan en el tiempo estimado y son aún mejor que lo descrito.",5
"This phone was perfect. Exactly as described. In perfect condition, completely unlocked. Added sim card been using it like crazy ever since. Absolutely love having an iPhone.",4
I got this phone within a few days. The item was in great condition looked like it came out of the box! All I had to do is get a sim card. I will definitely buy again and recommend others too.,4
Wasn't sure if I could connect to my family mobile plan. I called them and they took the IMEI number and I inserted my family mobile micro sims card and I was good to go. The phone I received looks new and runs great. Purched form JP Mobile LLC. Many people ask if they can use an iphone 4 unlocked with family mobile and yes you can!!!,5
"Nevertheless the power adapter was European type. Also Facetime is not available in this phone. It works ok for the rest, it was new, wrapped, no scratches.",4
THIS WAS SUCH A GREAT DEAL AND WELL WORTH THE VALUE. I DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH GETTING CONNECTED WITH T-MOBILE MY SERVICE PROVIDER AND I AM JUST LOVING THIS PHONE I NOW WISH I BROUGHT THE IPHONE 5,4
Totally and completely happy about how my new phone works. Definitely met if not exceeded my expectations!! Delivered on time and was in great condition. Wouldn't get my iPhone any other way.,5
"The celphone is perfect. the warranty is for one year and everithing is OK... well almost.The iphone wasn't unlocked, so I had to pay $25 in order to use it-",3
"I wanted a new iPhone, didn't need all the bells and whistles. And I didn't want to pay $650. So I bought this, bought the $99 apple care plus plan directly from Apple and now I'm covered for 2 full years! I love it!",5
I LOve the Iphone I ordered from jemjemcom I have never had a phone that would connect to metro pcs but this one did right away without a problem it got here the day after I ordered it really fast shipping !!! will be buying from them again!!,5
This phone was in perfect condition when received. My mother uses this phone currently. When I had it I used it for Tmobile and ATT and now she uses it on Net10 which im happy that it was actually unlocked- never had a unlocked phone. I was able to activate it easily and use it on my Gophone plans. Great buy!,5
I bought this refurbished cell phone and today when I first open it and swich it on I found out that it is not working at all!!!What can I do??Best regards Cristiana,1
I bought this phone about three months ago. It was beyond expectation. It was like new. No scratch and it works perfectly fine. I am loving it. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy a used iPhone 4.,5
"terrible company, they said the phone was new, it was reburbished, aflter a few months it did not work properly . they didnt do anything..do not buy anythinh from them!!!",1
This unlocked Iphone 4 is exactly what I ordered. So far I am happy with the product. It is brand new as I expected. Shipping took a bit longer than I anticipated. Product was shipped in perfect condition. Amazon was helpful with tracking this order.,5
Got my product fast and in great condition!! Was a little skeptical going into the purchase but it turned out perfect and saved me a couple hundred bucks!,5
"I am totally satisfied with phone and its features, It was unlocked and works properly. Just one thing that is bad about it is battery life that is very short. The rest is just perfect and it met all my expectations about Apple product. Thanks for good item.Siggesting for buying.",5
"Delivery was on time . The phone look good ,product details says excellent physical condition will come with box,manual and USB charger,but when I try to turn the on/off button is not function I was so disappointed and no USB charger, now I don't even know if I get someone fix it would the phone still work . I was so mad .",1
"I had to purchase a second phone since the first phone didn't come unlocked. This was an awesome purchase. It was factory direct, in great condition, packaged well, and with accessories. Great buy! This vendor got it right.",5
This phone works great for the most part. It was unlocked and looked very nice. Only problem is T-Mobile from what they said never had iPhone 4s on their service plans. So it worked a little but glitched a lot. Beware if you buy this for T-Mobile. Otherwise the phone worked well.,5
"Trying to get a refund...everything looks great, but not able to get service...either the cellular antenna is broken or there's something wrong with the SIM card port😣...wish that was in the product description😢",1
i bought this i phone as a gift to my friend and she took to India and it worked for some time and it is not working any ijust want to know what is the solution,1
the product does not meet the published because no supports two GSM networks in my country (Venezuela) and I have not managed to use; I am extremely upset and would appreciate a prompt response to this problem.,1
Do not buy. This IPhone 4 worked for a couple of months and then it wouldn't turn on. Just door knob dead!! You only get one month warranty so after that your screwed. Spend your money somewhere else!!,1
"My purchased was very good, except for the battery...I think that its duration is not good.Just one day standby is not good for a new cell phone. I don't know if this is normal or not. I purchased 2 iphone4 and both of them have the same problem. one minute in internet means 2% less of power.thanks and please I'll waiting for any response...",3
"It was bought for my Mother-in-law, and she loves it! So, thumbs up for you.. I thought no one has it in stock, but you did.. I think I'll buy other one for my Mom..",3
"I don't recommend this product for the following reasons:1. The iPhone came locked to AT&T as opposed to be ""unlocked"".2. The iPhone came out of warranty (purchased by another party in 2011) instead of being ""new""",1
"Product delivered as promised and in very good condition as promised. However, phone functionality is not very good. Drops a lot of call and overall does not work like I thought an iPhone should. Should have stuck with Android.",3
"I buy this product brand new, but the phone has come up with some stripes. No plastic glass and the seller is not specified is refurbished. The phone not working in Latin America, NOT UNLOCKED.",1
"Initially had trouble getting the service provider's SIM card working at the APPLE store. APPLE tech claimed the problem was that the phone was still ""locked"" by AT&T. Phone would not unlock for about 48 hours. Other than that, phone was as advertised.",4
"I bought it to use it in Argentina and it works great, never a problem. You can use it with the company you want because is unlocked. I recommend this iphone and this provider.",5
"This iPhone 4 unlocked came like a brand new phone. Plug, charging cord, ear buds and a car charger in a brand new box.It came before the estimated time and the service was great. Using iPhone already and love it. Thank you so much. Great company to buy from",5
"I was skeptical at first to buy refurbished, but this unit is excellent and I would not hesitate to do business with vendor in the future. It was better quality than described. Like an out of box experience, like New!!",5
I DO love this thing - and this is from someone who held on to his old clam shell phone for ever. My only mistake was being cheap and getting the 8 GB version. I think I would go for more memory next time.,5
"Love this phone. The volume needs to be adjusted but that's a manufacturer issue. It's not a problem with a blue tooth ear piece. I am a happy camper. It came on time, was spanking brand new in the original packaging.",4
This phone was not unlocked it was an ATT phone. After I took it to a cell phone shop to unlock it it now tries to connect to a network in europe. It is useless. They can not figure out how to fix It is still a a phone repair place. these guys are JUNK dealers,1
I was really scared by seeing the review after I bought the item but I got it today and It is brand new came with a sealed original packing and also works perfectly with my carrier :) thank you so much,5
worked great and is still providing good service. This was a gift to a person who did not know how to get a replacement for their broken phone. Saw him yesterday and he loves it. Great price. And it is an iPhone !,5
I like my phone it's really nice comparing to other ones. It works perfectly but the only concern I have is the battery doesn't last for long time don't know why.,5
"Purchased this iphone for my youngest son's birthday---it came in a timely manner and came in very good/new condition. Everything worked fine and we are very satisfied with the purchase, especially my teenage son!",5
This phone works great for the most part. It was unlocked and looked very nice. Only problem is T-Mobile from what they said never had iPhone 4s on their service plans. So it worked a little but glitched a lot. Beware if you buy this for T-Mobile. Otherwise the phone worked well.,5
"Trying to get a refund...everything looks great, but not able to get service...either the cellular antenna is broken or there's something wrong with the SIM card port😣...wish that was in the product description😢",1
"Delivery was on time . The phone look good ,product details says excellent physical condition will come with box,manual and USB charger,but when I try to turn the on/off button is not function I was so disappointed and no USB charger, now I don't even know if I get someone fix it would the phone still work . I was so mad .",1
"I had to purchase a second phone since the first phone didn't come unlocked. This was an awesome purchase. It was factory direct, in great condition, packaged well, and with accessories. Great buy! This vendor got it right.",5
This phone was in perfect condition when received. My mother uses this phone currently. When I had it I used it for Tmobile and ATT and now she uses it on Net10 which im happy that it was actually unlocked- never had a unlocked phone. I was able to activate it easily and use it on my Gophone plans. Great buy!,5
I bought this refurbished cell phone and today when I first open it and swich it on I found out that it is not working at all!!!What can I do??Best regards Cristiana,1
I bought this phone about three months ago. It was beyond expectation. It was like new. No scratch and it works perfectly fine. I am loving it. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy a used iPhone 4.,5
"terrible company, they said the phone was new, it was reburbished, aflter a few months it did not work properly . they didnt do anything..do not buy anythinh from them!!!",1
The ear piece doesn't work the only way i can use it is on speaker. Also if i had known that this was not the 4S as advertized but only a four when i received it i would have never let you rip me off!,1
"Worked for me on t-mobile. I did have to contact the seller as I couldn't get the phone to work with a t-mobile sim. Seller walked me through how to finish the unlocking process (connect to itunes, reset). Very happy with the purchase.",5
Okay when I got the phone it was 50% charged and it seemed to work fine until I used the speakers one of the speakers where broke. I still use the phone and its a great phone other then the speaker but I still recommend this phone. but you might want it to buy white cause my grandmother did and her was brand new.,3
"good evening on Monday October 12 this year, I made my claim with amazon regarding the phone to buy him in March as never lit me and accessories came in white and the phone is black, I wonder if comes the guarantee that I can do about it thank you very much.",1
Words can't describe how unsatisfied I am. The product I order was an iPhone 4 the phone was stolen. I could not connect it with sprint. Thanks for nothing.,1
First of all the Iphone receive was in great condition. Rival most brand new ones. Clean product. Unfortunately the phone has BAD ESN marked at stolen/lost by Sprint. Current unable to activate.,2
Should of been black color but only had white took the white color and they sent a free case it is my daughters phone she like it but I wish they had black,4
"Futures buying clients this company or person or as he calls himself, the only thing I can recommend not to buy, and to buy a new phone, no surprise to me that grabbed and proceeded to check it signal and observe the lack of several screws and especially that held the antenna so no",1
It works good. I already have one iPad. The phone works similar with iPad. It is different from iPad that I take iPhone to where I would go. The wifi seems better than iPad which I am not sure if setting different between the two.,4
"Excellent phone, It was a gift for my niece, and she really like it. She told me that this smart phone is excellent to have everything she needs everyday and also gets a lot of app, there are lots of free apps too. The reception is good, the sound, video, and pictures are excellent too.",5
"Worked for me on t-mobile. I did have to contact the seller as I couldn't get the phone to work with a t-mobile sim. Seller walked me through how to finish the unlocking process (connect to itunes, reset). Very happy with the purchase.",5
Purchased this phone thinking it was unlocked and it wasn't. And that it was a apple iphone from att. Upon receiving ut found out it eas sprint and that it wasn't able to use the phone. Requested a return label 48 hours ago for a refund and seller HSS yet to reply.,1
"I ordered on 16 and got it by 24 sep..its very good.. thought it was a second hand but still it looks like a new unlocked phone. I am happy to receive it as it plays very well. camera is good,. only on the back panel there are some scratches which is not so visible..I would rate it 5 out of 5 awesome phone.",5
"man i order this on December 29, 2015 and it said it will be arriving Janurary 5-8 but it came Janurary 2,2016 and it works came with charger only think wrong with it is that it comes dead i made sure to plug in and see if it works but i recommend it to anyone trying to buy this",5
"worst phone I ever gotten. I got this phone last year for 250 dollars, now its 150? recently I traded this phone in to verizon.I had an old iPhone 4 when I came in and now I came out with an iPhone 6s for cheap!",1
Very satisfied with my purchase! I ordered the refurbished version from a seller New York it arrived in less than a week and all I had to do was call straight talk and pay 8$ to get my number transferred with my minutes and in less than 5 minutes I was using my IPhone... I love this phone,5
For being a refurbished phone I say this phone is great. I haven't put minutes on it yet but will be soon. Wanted to get to know the phone 1st since it is my 1st iPhone. So far no problems with it expect when I use certain apps it drains my battery.,3
I received the phone and it wasn't straighttalk. I had to sit on the phone with straighttalk for an hour to pay a network fee of 6.99. Now. Two hours later. I am still sitting here waiting for it to be activated. And when I call the number it tell me it's unable to do it. I am severely irritated with this product n,1
"Got here fast, nice, new, and very helpful directions on how to set up with straight talk included. REALLY WORKS WITH STRAIGHT TALK. No problems getting it going. Love the phone. Very satisfied, even with it being a 6 yr old phone. Very much worth the small price you pay!",5
Shopping was very quick. Everything came with it in box and all. Brand new phone and had no problem with setting it up with Straight Talk. I love it. The only thing is that I didn't know so that's my fault is you have to pay $6.99 for the access code basically to activate it unless you buy your own activation set up kit.,5
"this is good phone, and good merchant the phone came in perfect condition ,, and the delivered was quick.. I like it a lot... I am a satisfied costumer,,,,,..good thanks",5
The phone itself was dusty inside the box. The phone was unscratched and we were able to get it activated after buying an activation package. It runs a but slower than expected which is why I gave 4 out of 5 stars.,4
"Came unopened,brand new. Which is something I was kinda worried about. Works wonderfully. Has a glitche,but what phone doesn't? Nothing that's unmanageable. Other than that great buy!",4
"We are very satisfied with the phone, it has worked better than expected. We were told it would work in some area codes in our area, but so far it has worked for us. Would recommend this phone and the no contract plan.",5
So I never had an iPhone wanted to try I say to try it out was wonderful and I love iPhone I got a iPhone 6 now and I love mine but the iPhone 4 is still great good see if u like it,3
Thank you!! phone was in beautiful shape!! everything worked perfectly and shipping was super fast!! will buy from seller again!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! A +++,5
"I Ordered this phone last week, I got it yesterday, and on the Box that it came in said it is a straight talk phone, even gave me the meid number but I am having a very hard time activating it, stayed on phone with straight talk all day yesterday and its still not activated.",2
"I can't lie the phone came fast. The condition of the phone was in great condition. Also it was easy to activate, took me about 10 mins. So I'll give it 5 stars and will recommend it to anybody",5
I bought this for my 15 years olds birthday. This was exactly as described! No scratches...perfect condition...beautiful!! It came within a timely manner and works perfectly on straight talk! I will definitely use them again with my next phone purchase. Extremely happy!!,5
"i m so satisfied with this phone and the seller was extremely nice and even put a little letter in with the device to help me set my phone up with straight talk carrier. With her help, it was so easy to set up the phone. if i ever need to buy another in the future, i know were to go to! :D",5
The first rating I gave on this phone was given because I hadn't received the phone yet. Now that I have received it my rating on it is excellent. Other than the fact it didn't come with charger when it was shown in the picture next to the phone. Never the less the phone is in very good condition. Was a good buy. I would recommend buying it.,5
"Was a bit difficult to set up with phone carrier, but great phone after that. Charger broke after a month, but all apple chargers are expected to do that. No problems with speakers/charging port/ buttons",5
"In an otter box, fell off the bed and screen went dead and was completely unusable. Stay away from I-anything.I gave it 5 stars because the seller got it to me quick and its no their fault the iphone sucks.",5
Received the phone early which is a definite plus since I'm impatient. Looks brand new and got it all set up with no issues. The only issue I had was I was not aware that it didn't come with a charger before I bought it. No biggy since I can get one at any gas station.,4
I love my phone it came way earlier than it was supposed to. It did not come with headphones but it came with everything else mentioned. My sisters are even buying phones from here I recommend it !,5
Just what we were looking for.Reasonably priced good condition.Fast service.Would recommend to anyone.Was a gift granddaughter loves it.Thinking of finding one for myself.,5
I greatly appreciated the fact that it DID INDEED come before christmas. I didnt recieve any texts or emails of where the package was at any given time. You should work on that. But it was a good feeling to see my little brothers face when he opened his present and saw a new iphone. Thnxs :3,4
"When I received the phone, it came in a ziplock bag with a sticker on it, plus the straight talk card. In order to get the phone to work I had to update the phone and spend over an hour on the phone with tech support (in India) and the WiFi still will not work. I expected more.",2
"Bought this very inexpensive phone for a teenager who loves it. Had a difficult time getting it activated following instructions from seller. Happy with product, but very disappointed with seller. Would not buy from this seller again.",4
This was advertised as a phone to use for straight talk wireless...I only wanted that and to get away from Verizon wireless..instead the straight talk ready to activate phone is in fact a Verizon only phone. Totally lied and misled me. I am irate to say the LEAST!!!,1
Love this phone - got here quicker than stated. I did have an issue with first phone but the company stuck with me and made sure I got a replacement - I highly recommend this product.,5
Had to resell the phone because it wasn't strait talk it was Verizon. wasted a month trying to get it fixed but just broke down and bought one that was actually a strait talk phone instead of haveing to deal with Verizon and strait talk.😠😠😠😠,1
"Phone did not match description, It had no place for a sim card like a regular iphone should, I tried to activate it and found out it was NOT a straight talk phone, right from the straight talk people. It took a long time to get my refund after a lot of unnecessary communications. Very disappointed and frustrated.",1
"Awesome for being a refurbished 4. Came within a week (though my order tracker says the delivery date is in April lol)Getting myself a 5 to try to catch up technologically, but this is exactly as described and works perfectly.",4
"Arrived quickly. Bought this a while back, and my experience with this phone it okay, kind of weird didn't have a sim card slot even though it said it would, but whatever. A good small phone that'll do the job, and a good price.",4
"It did not work, I could not get it to connect to wifi, and numerous other issues. After over 50 trys , I gave up and sent it back. I had to pay 20$ for restock fee ( which was taken from my purchase).",1
I like the phone but I'm limited on a lot of things with this phone compared to my old android. Couldn't Bluetooth my photos over and it doesn't let me download pictures.,4
"So worth every penny spent!! The phone looks very new and I didn't have any trouble at all switching my number to the phone or putting service on the phone! Plus if I had any question regarding the phone, they were all answered right away! Very happy with with everything :)",5
this is a great phone! its comes new! I only have one reason to give this 4 stars instead of five bc I had a tiny problem that im sure the seller will fix! buy this phone its great!:),4
Bought this for my hubby for Christmas. I ordered a bit too late and he didn't get it for Christmas day but he was just happy to get his own phone. And he is very pleasantly surprised at how much he loves his iPhone.,5
I love this phone but I haven't had it but a few months and the off button is broken and that's a lot of money to pay for something and it break in a few months,1
"Three days after I got the ohone, the display sdreen went put. the phne still worked, but you could not see the screen. After I tried many ways to get it to work with no sucess, I slamed the back of the phone with my hand. behold, the screen came on. I'm crossing my fingers!!!!",1
"I would highly recommend this purchase, becasue the phone is really affordable and cheap for an iPhone and my phone came in a great condition ! It also came in a VERY short amount of time. Love my new phone and I am extremely satisfied. Thank you Reza !",5
Ordered this iPhone as a replacement phone for samsung captivate. Although there were a few mistakes made I am enjoying my new phone (day 1). The seller was very helpful and very courteous and helped solve any issues I had! Good customer service! Completely recommend.,4
Phone will not charge properly with charger that came with it. Tried a new one and still won't charge correctly. Sent company a message and they never responded!,2
"I received this phone august 12, 2015. I have it till this day janurary 19, 2016. I have dropped it 6 times on concrete and hasn't broken! I got the 5c now, but boy would I recommend this. buying one for my little 13 yr old cousin. she will love it!",5
"Was not for straight talk. It was for Verizon so I had to call straight talk and buy a kit to transfer it to straight talk. The kit was only 6.99 but it wasn't something I expected to spend the extra money on. Please check your phones before saying they are with a company. Overall though, I love the phone and the shipping was fast!",1
i was so excited for this but straight talk is saying its NOT compatible with them so now im stuck with phone and the $45 card.. help? i don't know what to do,1
"I thought the phone was in excellent condition when I purchased it, I didn't have any problems getting it setup. It was totally easy from start to finish. My son loves his new iphone.",4
"Wanted it for use with Straight Talk, but it wasn't compatible. I was unable to get it to work at all. This one at least was unlocked so even though I can't use it as a phone, I can use it as a backup Ipod.",3
Really nice phone. Should have checked if it could be used in area first. Said it was for straight talk but couldn't use it for any of the companies in the area.,2
I had the iphone 4 a few years ago and loved it so i bought it again but i didnt know it could not update to ios 8 so i couldnt download some popular apps like instagram and twitter and some others. I should have bought the iphone 4s,3
"product was posted as being for straight talk but when i tried to activate it. i was informed by straight talk. that it was a ""locked"" verizon phone, i resold it on E bay for half what i paid for it and then ordered a phone through straight talk to avoid anymore hassle",1
"A few reviews said getting this product was a disappointing risk, but I disagree. I love this phone and it charges great! I'm a little upset I can't update the phone past 7.1.2 because some apps need 8.0 or newer, but for texting, calling, web and some apps, it's great! My first apple phone, and definitely not my last!!!",5
Didnt like it the lock button was sticky when i first got it cant return it because i droped it an screen cracked.it wont lock the button dont work anymore.,1
"iPhone came in good condition, had problems connecting it with straight talk, but contacted customer service and was able to connect in min, but it cost about 5 dollars with bring your phone through straight talk. It came with really cheap headphones, do not recommend them, overall it was a good deal.",4

"I love the phone, It was a great buy. It came really fast in the mail, way sooner than expected. There was only one problem with the purchase of my items. The problem was that the charger that came with the phone easily came unravled at the end of it. It still works but its barely hanging on and i doubt it will last much longer.",4
Omg this phone has exceeded my expectations and I'm actually using it right now to write this review. Beautiful and works perfectly. Battery life is incredible. I love my new phone!!!!,5
Ordered this for my sons birthday thinking it would work on straight Talk but it don't was really disappointed . The advertising was false don't recommend this for a gd buy,1
This iPhone is amazing! I love it! It does I'm fact work with straight talk. You juts have to go on the straight talk website and type in the code that's found under about in your settings. It works! Thank you guys! Five Stars!,5
"I was so happy and excited when I got this phone as a gift from my wife, but I was so disappointed because there was something wrong with the microphone. People couldn't hear me and I had to use the speaker which was awkward because people didn't know why they were on speaker! I eventually returned it and luckily got a refund.",1

"they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used iphones when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described",5
The phone had been opened. 3 Screws missing along with wifi connector clip and antenna clip under battery connector miss placed. Result little wifi connect ability. Hidden damage.,2
"I bought because It said that It was unlocked but It wasn't. Now I am in my country, Ecuador and It doesn't work so it is not open to use it worldwide.DON'T BELIEVE THIS GUY !",1
Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - VerizonI feel really stupid. I should have read all the reviews about Wireovia. Like so many others the home button is locked and the only way I can move from app to app is to turn the phone off and on. I am surprised that Amazon is still allowing them to sell on their site.,1
I sent back the iPHONE 4 one month ago because it does not respond when you push the bottom button to cancel or go back some of the time. I haven't received refund yet. What's going on? Please issue refund as soon as possible. Thank you.,1
I am so pleased with this purchase! Phone is in excellent condition as described and shipping was fast! This was one of the best purchases i've made and I'm so glad it was with bestDeals!! Thank you so much....absolutely no regrets and I will continue to buy merchandise from them!,5
"soon u will be in prison i already contacted general attorney just remember where ever you hide we can always find you ,, i hope u scared of what your doing i think ur not believing of bad karma just remember bad karma its always back to you",1
This was a used item but was in excellent condition. It was factory unlocked as promised. Just had to insert a micro sim card and we were up and running with our Tmobile account. The charger included did not work but we had an extra charger so it wasn't a problem.,5
The phone seems to be working very well no problems it had the storage capacity that was in the description looked felt and worked like a brand new phone so I will repost in a few months letting you know if the status remains the same.,4
"This phone is a total piece of crap! When I got it, the home button and one of the speakers didn't work. I've dropped another $100 fixing it. Too overpriced for the condition it was in. Never again will I buy from this seller.",1
"This phone is Described as NEW but obviously is not, phone appeared new in factory box. The first phone died after 2 hours, the screen when blank and could not be restarted. The second one worked okay except that the microphone was bad and callers could not hear you, nor could you do a voice recording.",1
Decided to upgrade my phone and found this phone available. Works fine and arrived without a problem. Price was acceptable and thee were no issues in the purchase or delivery of the phone.,5
"This phone didn't last 2 months. When I checked to view the return policy, it was only for 30 days. That's not fair. The speaker isn't working and the phone shuts down unexpectedly. I believe this phone was never a new phone!. Buyers beware!",1
"One of the speakers is broken from water damage, i learned cause i got it with a broken screen also and when i went to get it fixed they told me why complete waste.",1
This iPhone has exceeded my expectations. It is so reliable and I have already recommended it to my friends. The voice and other added features are just incredible,5
"This phone broke after 5 weeks the microphone quit working and I needed a working phone that day, I had to bring it to Apple, they gave me a new phone for $150, so add this to the $300 I paid for this phone so I got a brand new factory unlocked 32 GB iPhone 4 for $450 which is ok.",1
"I received yesterday, when I installed the simm (wich is working on other unlocked iphone 4 32gb), I realized that it is not unlocked, because the simm is invalid. I need as urgent to solve this problem. Please help me !!!!!",1
"Each day I become more and more satisfied with the Apple iPhone. Amazing performance, incredible graphics, very very functional, a great camera, great touch-screen response, thousand of useful and funny apps, excellent operating system. Apple shows why she's the market leader with this product.",5
"0 complainsthe iphone came to me brand new....and im using it in Caracas Venezuela, without any trouble!!!!!I think, these models come from europe, cause the battery charger, but these people incorporates an adaptor plug!!!",5
"I bought this Iphone form SJohnson236, and they send me locked Iphone with Gevey Adapter and ATT Software, I returned it the same day, and I got the refund, Thanks to Amazon",1
"Bought the iPhone for my female mate, but I do not use iPhone. A few months after the purchase, the iPhone is still working properly as like new. What a great purchase here!",5
Been using this phone for like six months now. Best cell buy I've made in years. I have watched its price on Amazon and the price keeps going up from when I made my purchase... If it goes back down I may consider purchasing an extra on one day,5
"As all Apple products, it's my number one choice. It's very convenient, easy to use, and works great. It has everything I need in a phone, a personal planner device, entertainment, and anything else you can think of, it's got it all.",5
"I was a little disappointed at the beginning, thinking I was getting a 4S. But when I checked back on the item description, I realized that it was a 4 the whole time- I just didn't read it well.Either way, I have enjoyed the 32gb of space, enabling me to put more music on my phone.I was able to unlock this phone easily with At&t.",5
"Looks great and is easy to use and update the software, but you have to be careful how you hold it or you attenuate the antenna and don't get much signal.",4
"I got this for my husband fr our anniversary and he absolutely loves it, did have alittle issue with the ring volume but had shut the phone off and turned it back on and it fixed the issue now it's been great.",5
"I received my order a couple days ago. To be honest, its not what I hoped. Most of the time when I make or receive a call, I hear nothing on the other end. Sometimes the whole thing just goes black, despite having an adequate amount of battery life on it. I am seriously considering sending this back for a refund. I am quite disappointed.",1
"here in guam , works perfect ,not any problems to activated, , able to work with any sms card and any region, able to download anything , this works fine!! love it",5
Had a bit of an issue at first. Apparently i had to connect it to itunes before using my new sim. Seller was very responsive. I am very happy with my product..Excellent condition with everything in place. will do business with this seller over and over again.Thumbs up!,5
I ordered for Apple iPhone 4 32GB (factory unlocked)- refurbished. The piece looks good to see. But the home is not functioning. I am totally disappointed with the seller. I dont know what to do now.,1
"this is used and is in great condition, came with earphone and wall charger and cord. now its the test of putting the sim (micro) {didnt check it would be a problem}in and seeing that it works great. there are very minor scratches on the side but it can be covered by a case.",5
"They sold it as a new phone but at day 40 it stopped working. The official Apple service confirmed that the iphone was not new, but rearmed with parts from other phones and that several of them were defective.It is a shame that mislead buyers this way. Do not buy this kind of phone.",1
"llego en excelentes condiciones a venezuela, es liberado, funciona con digitel movistar y movilnet, tal cual lo describian en la paginaarrived in excellent condition Venezuela, is released, works with movistar and movilnet digitel, described it as such on page",5
This Iphone is on IOS 7.02 I tried so many time to update to current IOS but it won't work. Also iphone 4 camera is pretty bad I can't video call or record videos clear nor can I take selfies clear its blurry. I was expecting better quality iphone for What I have paid but this is so bad iphone. Very disappointed,1
"I had to return it, because it would not work with Tracfone. It did not have cdma protocol required by Tracfone. The phone itself was in perfect condition, and I hated to part with it.",5
It came out really good like how it was shown in the images and in the details and what comes with the only one thing was that wen I got it didn't look clean it had some dirt but that wasn't a problem it was easy to take off but other than that 👏,5
The phone shuts itself off even when the battery isn't dead. The battery dies in less than two days even with NO use! It's supposedly new in the box and that appeared to be true but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all.,1
"I have been using the cell phone for 1 month and it is working very good, i would definetely recomend it , just you need to know that this kind of apple cell phone doesnt work with sprint, verizon and METROPCS but with T Mobile and AT & T works good.",5
"Very Amazing Phone. I can't believe the phone was 32GB and Factory Unlicked and I paid less than a Brand New locked 8Gb phone. This is a much better deal and I returned the new iPhone I ordered previously, Thank You Very Much For This Amazing Deal I Love Amazon And Bayshine Inc.!!! :D heck ya!",5
I have had I phones 4s before and feel one of the best models Apple had made. This phone was in great shape while looking so slick. The seller had described the phone exactly the way it is and I'm very happy with my purchase,5
"Bought two of them. The first one you have to push the middle button a few times to get it to work. The second one was ok, but the volume seems to mess up on it a lot.",3

This phone is working great right out of the box. All I had to do is pop in a SIM card and I was off and running. I ordered for Universal Cell Services. I recommend them.,5
The phone had already some repair done to it. The on and off device was broken and I had to bring it to a repair shop to make it again. It costs me 50$. The repairman discovered it was repaired before. Since I was abroad it was to hard to sent the phone back. Very bad business. I was conned. Severina Kolloffel,1
"Apple makes an excellent product, so I have no complaints about the phone itself. However, it came with no accessories: not even a charger?!? That was disappointing.",3
I read the review for the seller before I ordered the phone. He was very helpful and understanding. He even went as far as putting addition money out of his pocket to expedite my shipment. I would recommend him for anybody. My wife is extremely pleased with the phone....no issue whatsoever. Thank you.,5
The phone screen broke and took it to a repair shop. There I was told that the screen had been replaced before.I bought the phone for new and got a used one.Avoid Cali Wholesale,1

The phone shuts itself off even when the battery isn't dead. The battery dies in less than two days even with NO use! It's supposedly new in the box and that appeared to be true but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all.,1
"I have been using the cell phone for 1 month and it is working very good, i would definetely recomend it , just you need to know that this kind of apple cell phone doesnt work with sprint, verizon and METROPCS but with T Mobile and AT & T works good.",5
"As all Apple products, it's my number one choice. It's very convenient, easy to use, and works great. It has everything I need in a phone, a personal planner device, entertainment, and anything else you can think of, it's got it all.",5
"I was a little disappointed at the beginning, thinking I was getting a 4S. But when I checked back on the item description, I realized that it was a 4 the whole time- I just didn't read it well.Either way, I have enjoyed the 32gb of space, enabling me to put more music on my phone.I was able to unlock this phone easily with At&t.",5

"I received my order a couple days ago. To be honest, its not what I hoped. Most of the time when I make or receive a call, I hear nothing on the other end. Sometimes the whole thing just goes black, despite having an adequate amount of battery life on it. I am seriously considering sending this back for a refund. I am quite disappointed.",1

I ordered for Apple iPhone 4 32GB (factory unlocked)- refurbished. The piece looks good to see. But the home is not functioning. I am totally disappointed with the seller. I dont know what to do now.,1
"this is used and is in great condition, came with earphone and wall charger and cord. now its the test of putting the sim (micro) {didnt check it would be a problem}in and seeing that it works great. there are very minor scratches on the side but it can be covered by a case.",5
"I had to return it, because it would not work with Tracfone. It did not have cdma protocol required by Tracfone. The phone itself was in perfect condition, and I hated to part with it.",5
It came out really good like how it was shown in the images and in the details and what comes with the only one thing was that wen I got it didn't look clean it had some dirt but that wasn't a problem it was easy to take off but other than that 👏,5
I have had I phones 4s before and feel one of the best models Apple had made. This phone was in great shape while looking so slick. The seller had described the phone exactly the way it is and I'm very happy with my purchase,5
"Bought two of them. The first one you have to push the middle button a few times to get it to work. The second one was ok, but the volume seems to mess up on it a lot.",3
"Very Amazing Phone. I can't believe the phone was 32GB and Factory Unlicked and I paid less than a Brand New locked 8Gb phone. This is a much better deal and I returned the new iPhone I ordered previously, Thank You Very Much For This Amazing Deal I Love Amazon And Bayshine Inc.!!! :D heck ya!",5

"the iPhone was in excellente conditions, it was everything that they described at the iPhone's Description, it was delivered at the time that they told me that was going to be, and it was in perfect conditions",5
"I bought this product about three weeks ago and it was well worth the money. It's convenient, stylish, reliable, utilitarian, user friendly and multifunctional. I could never go back to not having a smart phone. Just do it.",5
It's a shame that apple restreindre some of their amazing products so users have to use methods like jailbrake an unlocking that some times limits the usage of the products worldwide.,4
"the services is great, the product is like its been described just that i didnt get my earphones but apart from that great job,i got my product before the time scheduled, thanks",5
"this is a great upgrade from the 3gs it has mainly 3 features i love the 32gb hard drive that allows me to get more apps, the better camera with flashh i love it and the front camera it makes it fun to take photos highly recommended",5
"The phone That Was selected in the section of unlocked phones, so It was like I was looking, for When I Get My Hands I Noticed That the equipment is locked and in my country I can not unlock. I am not Satisfied with the purchase and request that I change it so we can make use of the phone you buy. Apple iPhone 4 Black Smartphone 32GB (AT&T)",1
"BE CAREFUL! This phone is under the unlocked phone category but it is NOT UNLOCKED. True, it does not come with a service contract, but it only works with AT&T in the USA. BE CAREFUL!",1

"This is my first smartphone.Have been using the phone for about three weeks.Since I already had a Ipod touch it was just a matter of learning the phone function.The phone is lighter than I expected.I signed up for a straight talk plan.I only make phone calls,text,send e-mail and browse the web so this plan is perfect for me.",5
"Purchase new iPhone 4 32GB according advertisement, but once open, missing headset and media book.If new item, it must have adepter, USB charger, headset, and media book kit.",3
"I purchased this iPhone 4 and there was nothing saying that it's lock to AT&T and can't be used out side USA (I wonder where is the customer rights to select a carrier), once i received it i notes that it will not work on Qatar, i am waiting for the unlock solution for OS 4.2.1 BB 3.10.01",1
"I bought this product, and I sold to my friend in Brazil and he told me that this product is not unlocked, I lost money because I bought as unlocked. Probably is my last time buying by amazon or from the person that sold to me. Take care with information about unlocked cell phones!",1
I was ordered an iPhone 4 unlocked and I have received one locked on AT&T. I unlocked it with gevey and now is working fine. I spent to much money for a locked iPhone. Shame.,1
"Now there's the 5s, I can't go back to the 4. It hits my cheek and I either beep the numbers at the other person, or I'll put it on mute accidentally. Some street kids stole it the other day, so I'm going to get a 5 tomorrow. You can't beat Apple.",4
I received my product before I expected in perfect condition and operating status. The seller answer all my questions and exceded my expectations at all times.,5
"This phone was advertised as unlocked when that was not the case. I am with provider AT&T and they stated it was a locked phone and it couldn't be activated. Now I am stuck with a phone that will never be activated, and I'm afraid to purchase a phone through amazon again.",1
"Great purchase. Works just fine and US Cellular figured out how to get it working with my account. The clerks didn't know how to activate, not the seller's fault. Excellent phone, highly recommend doing business with this merchant.",5
"When I ordered it I was scared that it wouldn't come in. which, the phone came in. It is in PERFECT condtion. it's been a month. and I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!",5
Not upto the mark..as they mentioned in portal....phone is not that good....so next time please give correct information about the products so that customers will no confuse....anyway its ok. my fault..:),2
"After I received this phone, I give it to my daughter for use and surprise, the phone was locked. I contacted the vendor to resolve the problem but I've never got a positive reply or resolution. We ended by paying more money to unlock the phone.",2
The phone Came in time and was able to go to the sprint store and he was able to get ever thing working on the phone and be able to use it right off the bay the phone come with ever thing and it looked like it was brand new !,5
The phone was as described it was kept in very good conditions all its functions work properly and the best thing about it is it came super early so thanks man,5
"I ASK FOR A UNLOCKED IPHONE 4S WHITE, BUT I RECEIVE A LOCKED IPHONE 4S BY SPRINT LOCKED, WHEN THE ADD SAID FABRIC UNLOCKED, IT WAS A UNLOCKED IPHONE PRICE BUT IT WAS NOT UNLOCKED, SO I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED. AFTER ALL THAT HAD HAPPEN TO GET IT, IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED.",2
The amount of gigs advertised is a lie. Don't quote me.. but i'm pretty sure mine might have had some sort of malware or virus pre installed on it.p.s. I could be wrong.But from now on i'm going directly to the nearest apple store.,2
"I lost my good phone while on vacation and needed a temporary one until I hit my upgrade period. This phone was in good condition and works. It is obviously and old model, but I had no issues activating it on my own. The battery life is OK, maybe a day with light usage, but this must be expected when buying an old phone.",4
"Not a bad phone at all, except it stops vibrating for texts or other notifications every now and then. I even made sure the vibration was activated for the phone. But other than that it's alright.",3
"Great phone ,however , it's not connected with Sprint as advertised. Therefore ,its not sprint ! So the best option in buying a expensive Apple iPhone u must make sure that it can advertised as a sprint phone .",3
So far it seems to be a great phone for that generation. It came to us with the tiniest of tiny scratches on the face so that is awesome for a recycled phone. It works great.,5
First phone didn't recognize at times during the day that it had a battery at all. The second phone's ear speaker didn't work. Tired of paying $35 to have phone number moved to the next phone,1
Worst cell phone ever. It has all kinds of problems including all the basics. It drops calls all the time by just turning itself of. It can't be turned of at all. And the seller won't communicate with me about these problems. Don't buy anything here!,1
"Great price, and great condition. The only problem, and nothing to do with the product, is that the 4S doesn't work too well with the current Apple OS, so it was super sluggish. But besides that, loved the purchase, and served as the perfect backup phone for when my main phone takes an unexpected vacation into the toilet.",4
"Love my new Apple iPhone 4S. The phone came as almost brand new and I was able to go to the local Sprint store to get it activated within five minutes with no problems! Also, the accessories such as the headphones and charger are working brand new as well. Definitely got my money's worth. Thank you Amazon!",4
Delivery took six days. That was as expected and described. The phone is new and sealed in the box. Be sure to get and use a gel case because it inhibits dents and cracks. We do love it.,5
"This phone did not hold a charge and when I did charge it, it was very hot to the touch and I could not hold it to my ear. I have returned it and waiting for a refund.",1
i placed the order and two days later i received it. kind of sketchy though because it was wrapped in three plastic bags and put into a box. the phone however is in great condition. i hope it wasnt stolen lol,4
Great product. Replaced my android eve which I grew to not being able to stand. The iPhone has no problems other than it being a little more user friendly.,5
"Product is good, works fine, but I decided to stay with AT&T and this is a Sprint. I asked for an exchange or to return it and no one replied to me. So just make sure its exactly what you need and hope nothing changes because you're stuck with it, reguardless of what policy is stated",3
"the iphone is great. the only problem i had was the fact that the charger wasnt working. luckily, i had my ipods charger and that worked for it. overall i highly recommend it",4
"i have bought a IPHONE 4S and cheeped to Angola, but unfortunatly i cannot use it because its locked and came with a sprint sim nº ICC ID8901010 / 018633051660F card, according to Sprint assistant this a stolen IPHONE and cannot be unlocked.Please revert ASAP",2
"I lost my money by buying this phone!!!!!I did not understand it was a locked phone!!!I live in Brazil and here there dont have SPRINT!It was the worst purchase of my life!!Is standing there in the drawer, serves no!!",1
Our first smart phones. New as advertised. They arrived in sealed original packages. Activated them on our Ting account online in just a few minutes. We like them very much. A bit of a learning curve for a couple of 65 year olds used to flip phones. But we are learning and best of all our kids have quit bugging us about our old flips.,5
The phone worked fine. It shall be used as an Itouch and not an Iphone. There was a small blemish on it. It was the best value for what I was looking for.,4
"Got the item, and this one was not reported stolen. It was stated as being new on the ad, but it is not. It works, and I am happy, but considering it is used, I feel the price was a little high. Overall, I like the phone, it arrived early, it was not stolen, and it works.",4
"Despite that the phone was in quality condition, this phone was unable to be activated on my account because it was reported as lost/stolen and can never be activated. I AM OUTRAGED! I have waited for days for this phone to get here only to realize that this was a scam. Poor choice.",1
"Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - sprint, mobile phones labeled as very really true, should be good, after the receipt of the goods found the phone glass front panel corners of serious bump sneer temporarily, over a period of time to prepare for the Apple 5now with no problems.",1
The phone was logged into sprint with no problems and is working great! This company was a pleasure to work with and their products are above expectations! Very pleased with this purchase.,5
"hello.good afternoon, estimated at the time of purchase for iphone 4s I appeared at the time of purchase unlocked iphone and now appeared locket, please tell me what should I do.thack yuo",1
"First time user of the I-Phone, really enjoying the product, took a little time getting use to the difference between Android and the Apple. I was happy with the fast delivery time of the product and item was in good condition.",5
"Very satisfied with the 4s - I use it on TING and my bill is 55 a month for two of us who use plenty of data, texts and minutes.Easy to setup on ting.",5
"I recently purchased this to replace my fiance's LG G2 (screen cracked 2 times on the darn thing). The order was fulfilled by Avid Cell, and came in perfect working condition. It holds a charge, has full functionality, and looks as though it was never even used. My fiance and I are both very pleased with the purchase.",5
I HAD INTENDED TO USE THIS PHONE WITH BOOST MOBILE SERVICE BUT WAS TOLD THATI COULD NOT USE IT FOR ANYBODY BUT SPRINT! SO NOW I'M STUCK WITH A SPRINT PHONE AND DONT WANT A SPRINT SERVICE PLAN...,1
this iphone saved my life and money as well. phone was brand new and I still have this phone. Was very pleased with this purchase and was so glad to find a new IPHONE on AMAZON for an affordabe price,5
"The product is not what you wanted, try to connect several times to the seller, without any success, the product had a flaw in the letter ""a"" does not work and I asked for an unlocked phone and sent me a locked phone",1
"I am bowled over by my phone! Not what I expected, for it arrived early, and there was not a scratch on the phone, like brand new! A pleasant surprise, thank you so much!",5
Over all a very nice phone for the price. The only sign of it being used was a tiny scratch on the screen. My only issue with the phone is that the power button on the top broke within 2 weeks of me using it. I have been able to use assisted touch to still use the phone but it is rather annoying.,4
"And the home button is crooked!!!!!!!!!!!! Are you kidding me?! The phone works just fine otherwise, but whoever refurbished this didn't bother to clean it OR put the home button back in properly. The speakers, headphone jack hole, and the charging slot are all absolutely filthy and so clogged with dust, I am surprised they even WORK.",3
This phone was exactly as described. It has a small chip on the top corner but you couldn't tell especially if you had a case on the phone. I had no problems contacting sprint and setting it up. Had the phone for about a year before I moved over to T-Mobile,5
False advertisement Don't purchase. Ordered white Sprint iPhone 4s and received black Verizon IPhone 4s. Couldn't use the phone at all. Purchased for my daughters 11th birthday however had to disappoint her. Read the reviews because they are true. Now have to wait to receive my money back.,1
This phone is horrible it does not charge and when it is fully charged it only stays on for 15 mins plus when the phone charges it overheats....i needed this phone for work and one of my customers with a dying 5% iphone stayed charged longer than this phone on 30%,1
"It was exactly the model I wanted. But It was my mistake when I did not realize that it was not ""unlocked"" and my son could not use it where he is now living. The ""Sprint"" company does not work in the area he lives. So I returned the Iphone just for that issue. But delivery time, return was also ok. Sorry for my mistake.",4
"The power cord was a little damaged, however, it was shipped right away and the phone condition was accurately advertised. There were no problems with getting Sprint to activate the phone for me. Overall, very pleased. I was reluctant as this was my first used phone purchase but relieved that everything turned out well.",4
"Has worked out perfectly.. since its an older model, we were worried that it might be missing some essential tasks such as a good camera.. it has been more than we expected.",5
"Perfect phone... Hooked this up to my Ring+ account, no issues whatsoever. Now I have a cheap phone with a free monthly plan that works for me! Couldn't be happier. If you need a cheap plan, take a look at Ring+ and see what you think, uses the Sprint network for service.",5
"Great customer service. Packaged professionally, was checked for quality control. Was clear for easy Sprint set -up just as implied. Great communication when I emailed concern about it arriving when I was out of town- they hustled and got it out to me same day and I got it 3 days earlier. Awesome!",5
It was a replacement phone. I had lost my original iphone 4s and replaced it with the same model.I loved it then and I love it now. The seller delivered quickly and I am very satisfied with his service.,5
"I bought this phone considereing i could UNLOCK IT since i live in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, and there is no SPRINT here.very sad, the phone does not activate, unless i have a sprint account.",1
"did not work upon opening it. blamed me for it not working. had to pay for shipping back and a ""restock fee"". so I basically paid 100 for a phone that I shipped back that never worked.",1
"the order arrived on time, the phone was in great condition, it was with the right carrier, it came in the original box with all parts included, and it had a clean esn, perfect.",5
The description of the phone said it was new but the box was open and the charger was used.. The phone it self looked new and it word greate!! Can complain over all..,3
I bought this used for less than 300 bucks and it came with the box and accessories and was in mint condition. It was a Christmas gift so I was worried what it would look like but it looks brand new. The ESN was clean and we activated it just fine.,5
"Has worked perfectly but did not totally seem to be ""brand new."" Appeared to be refurbished, but I have no proof of that. The phone looks great, works great. I am enjoying it immensely!",4
Knock off product I think. Screen seal failed shortly after purchasing and the screen protector was definitely not like past ones I bought had dots all over it,1
"After 6 months having to this iPhone 4s I have had to change the battery twice which was 40 dollars each time. Also have had to many over heating , speakers didn't work and had to change twice as well",1
I don't really care for the Apple products because they are so hard to get your account set up for the app store but my daughter thought she needed a iphone and I guess they work pretty well,4
"Other than the fact that Sprint service is almost nonexistent where I live, the main feature that was wrong with the phone was the volume. You had to be very close to the phone in order to hear it and inerdz still made me pay to ship it back.",1
"Great phone! Worked without issue for quite a while, eventually the screen stopped adjusting when I turn it on its side but whatever, it's an old phone at this point. Highly recommended!",4
"Sprint would not activate the phone they said it was lost or stolen. The phone was in great shape when I received it, but could not be activated I looked for a phone # to call to see if I was doing something wrong but could not find one. I hope the return process goes well.",1
"I ordered these phones for my brother and niece, and didn't realize that they have to be 'unlocked' for the particular phone service you use. I have since returned them for a refund and my brother bought the correct ones locally.",1
I give to you 5 starts because you deserve it. that experience with you was really great I am very happy to have business with you once again thank you and keep doing like that.,5
Received this phone in a timely manner and the customer service rep really answered my query. Didn't use yet with a SIM card but wifi use is very good. Planning to use abroad .,5
"Sometimes the touch screen doesn't respond to my touch, but it's probably nothing major. I really needed an Iphone 4s and quick after my old one broke beyond repair, so I bought this product. It had everything I needed, and it came to me quicker than expected.",5
Phone had no MEID number so you CAN'T activate it with Sprint...Completely bogus! Bought two identical phones from JemJem. The other one had a blown earpiece in the phone. Certified refurbished?!? Probably not. Very shady.,1
"I've had no issues with this phone. This is my third iPhone. My original one from Apple had a button that stopped working while it was under warranty, so they replaced it with a refurbished one. That didn't last as long unfortunately. So we had to buy out of pocket. So far no complaints with this product.",5
Bought a phone supposedly BRAND NEW and 3 months later had to take it to the apple store because internet wouldn't work and find out they cant even work on it because the phone had been tampered with and the front screen wasn't even an apple product!! Now I cant even contact seller because # is disconnected! BE WARNED,1
I bought this iphone because the one i had broke but the phone is okay it cam package pretty well but after about a month the speakerphone feature stopped working. Other than that I guess the phone is okay if i keep my head phones on all day and just talk through that.,3
"My wife lost her phone and I sure as hell wasn't going to pay the phonr company price or do an upgrade with them. So I found this place. It was highly rated and its on amazon, so I gave it a shot.The phone has been working well, no problems that I can tell.I would do this again with this company with no hesitation.",5
I love this phone. I had an ipod that died and my android phone broke. I bought this as a used phone but it was in new condition. I love the iphone because I can sync it with my ipad and use it in place of my ipod that died. I just hope the battery holds up well.,5
"Exceeds expectations, battery last all day, and rarely force closes any apps. It's my first experience with apple software and I haven't had any problems using it.",5
"This phone was purchased to update from the Iphone 4, I know there isn't a really big difference between the iphone4 and iphone 4s but to me I can tell a difference. I love the iphone 4s",5
"This is NOT a UNLOCKED phone, there is a debt against the phone or it is STOLEN. It was cracked on the front and back!! from top to bottom!!! I do not like to be lied to. This was my daughters birthday present and we are both upset and will never go to this company again!!!",1
My phone is perfect. No problems whatsoever. I am completely happy with it. It was much cheaper this way than buying a new phone from the company without an upgrade. Thank you very much.,5
"the phone was on sprint with a sprint sim card, i think it is already unlocked, perfect condition, no problems, just like a regular iphone would work, if your looking for a cheap iphone 4s or in a budget, get this, and if you are looking for a five star or great reviews, get this.",5
"The phone only work for 1 day and I return it and still don't get a new phone or my money back and I am very ,very disappointed because I purchase the phone for my son birthday and to find out the is no good! Yes I am upset .",1
"I bought my 4s I Phone don't knowing that was locked for Sprint use only. And I don't know how to deal with that problem now. And to pay u$s 50 a month (the Sprint Fee), seems too much to use only a Month per year in USA.",1
The phone was in great condition. It had no scratches and it works perfectly. None of the buttons were stuck or broken and the phone was just perfect.,5
"Absolutely love this product... I've been wanting one forever and if far exceeds my expectations :)If u are obsessed w apple like me or want a very user friendly phone u need to get this. I got my mom an iPod touch for xMas and she loves it then I showed her that my phone is exactly the same , she was sold and it will b her next phone too!",5
The phone works awesome and I had no problems activating it...shipped on time also. Great buy! Everything the advertisement said was true and I'm really happy with this product.,5
"dont buy it from this person, they are stolen. whoever it is will send it to you with no esn on it, so that means it's stolen. plus they are pretty much jipping you about 200 dollars.",1
"Amazing condition when it was received, works very well. When I left my last company, I had to leave their iPhone 5S behind as well...so I found a this older 4s on Amazon and it has surpassed my expectations! Nice job! A vendor you can trust.",5
I purchased a iPhone 4S and it had hardware failures within two months. They replaced it and I had similar issues a month later. They will not doing anything else for me. I like Apple products just not this seller.,1
"Honest seller, packaged well, I still have it, great phone..it sure would work better if I didn't smash the screen myself.. Time for a new one. I like buying used Iphones. I don't have to treat it as if it's a newborn child. They last.Don't need to say much about the phone. Even in used condition, Apple is now my brand of choice.",5
This is not a sprint phone it is aTT phone ! Can not be used. This was a complete waste of money for me. Its useless to me. I purchased this phone as a backup phone in case mine or my husband broke. There's no way to unlock it and use it with sprint. I would not recommend anyone to purchase a phone this way.,1
I purchased a phone about 6 weeks ago and had nothing but issues. It was setup for sprint service but couldn't be added to the network. The phone was listed as 'lost or stolen'. I have since returned it and hope no one has to go through a similar experience.,1
I really love this iPhone it looks brand new its was well packedand i have no problem with it so far. I will be buying another one from this seller in the future i recommend this to anyone,5
"The popper replaces one we've had for many years. It was just what we needed.The iPhone is good, no problems. I'm still getting used to it because I haven't had a smart phone before.",4
"I'm not satisfied, the iPhone was supposed to be in good condition but it dies all the time, regardless of what battery percentage it is at. I have to carry around a portable charger because I never know when it will die.",1
"Took phone to Sprint store and as soon as the clerk opened the back, he saw the serial number (or whatever number identifier they look at) and right away new it was not a Sprint phone. Also there was something wrong with the SIM card, or it didn't come with a SIM card. Anyway, I had to return the phone and got a refund. So buyer beware . . .",1
"I've had to replace my cell phone twice in the last month. Don't ask. Suffice it to say it involved a toilet and a bad fall. This phone arrived in perfect condition and I was able to transfer my number, data, etc. via Sprint online. Thank you!",5
"This phone did not hold a charge and when I did charge it, it was very hot to the touch and I could not hold it to my ear. I have returned it and waiting for a refund.",1
"Has worked out perfectly.. since its an older model, we were worried that it might be missing some essential tasks such as a good camera.. it has been more than we expected.",5
"Perfect phone... Hooked this up to my Ring+ account, no issues whatsoever. Now I have a cheap phone with a free monthly plan that works for me! Couldn't be happier. If you need a cheap plan, take a look at Ring+ and see what you think, uses the Sprint network for service.",5
"I bought this as a gift for my great nephew who lives in Australia, I did not read the detail about the phone being locked to sprint. I cannot unlock it from Australia. One very disappointed little boy.",1
"The phone was as described, and the delivery was accurate. My grandson says the phone was like new, and we didn't not have any problems with the activation at Sprint.",4
"I try to activate the iphone 4s in front of the Verizon wireless, but the service told me that the iphone 4s I just bought from Werehouse Deal is a stolen one!!!!",1
"My phone was exactly as described, in great condition. It was wrapped securely in bubble wrap and came with everything it was supposed to. And it got to me very quickly. I love my phone and am glad I found one here in such perfect condition and for a great price",5
"I bought this phone for my wife, and she loves it. The Siri voice command feature is great. I have had one for 6 months and we both would highly recommend the iPhone 4S.",5
"I have buy 4 4s, two of them are in white and others black, all marked used-good, the white is ok but the black really have poor quality, the steel outside if full of scratch and the edge of black glass is broken, i don't think it can make used-good. much more difference like the same grade white I received.",2
"Love the phone; not, the battery life so much! Battery life is something apple needs to dramatically improve in all of it's phones. It is super cool you can text other iphones for free! I also activated it with tracfone and it was a breeze!",4
The iphone5 was supposed to be neww. Well it define try wasn't. The phone can't hold a charge. Had trouble connecting with the Internet. Paid a lot of for a worthless phone.,1
This phone was not originally Verizon aand for the money that was paid I can't get on the internet unless I am somewhere where someone has WiFi. Very disappointing .,1
You can't hear from ear piece and the call screen disappears and every once in a while letters and numbers flicker while in a call phone had issues when shipped,2
"Product was defective, not charging properly. Battery drains immediately even while on standby. Something that shouldn't have been sold to us. People just like to sell you anything even if they are aware of it being defective.",1
"Phone works great and just as promised on the discription, the only problem was I paid extra for 2 day shipping and it actually took a week but other then the wait everything came as expected",5
"I bought this phone for my daughter's 15th birthday. She loves it! It arrived in pristine condition, we easily activated it at our local Verizon store, and it has been working perfectly ever since. The seller provided great follow up to our order. I would absolutely purchase from this seller again. :)",5
"The truth is, they are both fabulous pieces of equipment that we are all very lucky to have in our lives. I actually remember having a 4 digit phone number and 5 people sharing the same line!! But, for reasons subtle which I am not even totally conscious of, I love my iPhone and I didn't love my Android.",5
"the product was not required because I'm blocked with the telephony company verizon, I try to unlock it but it is very expensive and keep him. now the battery does not work and not to do, I lost my money, please tell me that I can do, if I can still return it. thanks",2
"I bought this to use on my Tracfone account. Works perfectly, and I save a lot of bucks. This iPhone looks like new, includes charger and cable, plain box. Very pleased with the purchase.",5
"After grandson's 5C phone got left in his baseball pants and went through the wash, we got him the 4S phone. The phone arrived in 2 days and he is very happy with it.",5
I spent a long time researching phones online because a lot of these deals seemed like scams. This one was not and I'm glad I made the right choice. Phone was brand new and had zero problems. I used it as a temporary for a month and it worked perfectly!,5
Just put the screen in today myself. Seems to be working the way it's supposed to. It was really easy to install just watch a YouTube video and follow the steps to a T... Would recommend and buy again at this point.,5
The phone has no sound except through the headphone jack. We tried everything to get it to work. I am one for honesty and am VERY upset that they tried to lie about a hardware problem. (Yes that is what the problem is),1
"The phone worked fine for a few weeks, then started glitching. I asked to send it back and get a refund the seller pretty much said no that it was the software for Apple.",1
"fuckyou！SB cnm Mobile 100% refurbished assembly machine. The seller may be a chinese. Mobile phones may come from Shenzhen, china. Packaging, manual, charger, data cable, earphone. All false. Check the warranty period. The back cover of the phone actually chinese. Battery fever, power down fast. We don't buy it. He's got a complaint.",1
"The first phone I received was a turned in gov't. phone with a bad battery, the second phone was an a.t.t. phone. I sent them both back and went back to my ravine flip phone that always works. So much for upgrades!",1
"Battery dies ASAP, have to purchase new battery, iPhones aren't like other cell phones do you have to pay someone to install battery or purchase special tools and hope you do it right.",3
Seller was helpful fast delivery great phone. Have had it almost year still works great . Was just like described 2 small scratches on glass I barely saw,5
"This phone was sold to me by Amazon Warehouse Deals, Inc. Nowhere in the description did it state that this was a LOCKED phone! I am beyond disgusted with Amazon right now!",1
This is exactly what I expected. I recommend purchasing from XOMADIC . There are little to no scratches/scufs no cracks at all. When I first got I thought I had a new Phone. Also it came 5 days early which is also a plus. I highly recommend purchasing from him. Very satisfied.,5
"The description clearly stated that it was a Verizon phone, but when I called to activate the phone, Verizon assured me otherwise. I essentially bought a $210 paper weight.",1
"I buy it unlock the phone to find it, but when it is not received Unlocked, I need to pay an additional $ 56 to unlock it.Although it looks very good.",3
Thanks so much for a smooth purchase and A+ service. Will be giving this phone to my sister for christmas and am very stoked to have gotten such a great product at such a reasonable price. Cheers!,5
"It is great, Brand new phone as I expected. Arrive in time. The transaction was flawless! The seller even contact me during the shipment. Now it is on my hand, I will say it is a quite literally very good product and customer-service I could ever hope for. Will deal business with the seller next time. Hope you have good business! """,5
Very happy with the iphone. Other than a small chip on the corner of the phone it works PERFECTLY!It arrived in great timing (4 days) and was able to activate the phone with no problems. I am very pleased with this product and would recommend buying from this user again.,5
"I am very busy and use my phone a lot for business. I am always hesitant to get a new phone because I hate to ""figure it out"".This Iphone 4s has been the easiest phone that I have EVER owned and it's FUN!",5
I had an issue with Verizon getting the phone activated. These guys were incredibly responsive and helpful getting something resolved that in the end actually had nothing to do with the phone they sold me.As for the phone itself. It came in great condition.Rob,5
Phone is in excellent shape physically. Screen has some lighting/image burn issues and battery life is not like new...but then again the phone isn't new so that's to be expected I suppose.,4
I will never shop at amazon again to this date I still cannot use the phone I purchased because there was no user name and pass word to unlocked the device and to make things worst the website that was provided to unlocked the phone was not able to do so,1
"I have enough to buy a 4S product performance is perfect, the Internet phone messages are very good. Very grateful to the U.S. Amazon warehouse to give me such a perfect product.",5
"The phone is received was more than excessively scratched up, it took Verizon 2 hours to activate it, and it's overheating as we speak in my hand. I've literally had it activated for all of 5 hours fully charged it and it's battery is already dead. The description is nothing like what I received this morning. I'm beyond pissed.",1
These phone keeps on turning it self off and the battery life last on like 3 hours or less. So if there is any one who knows what up let me know it a it's a hassle to return it.,1
"I needed a replacement phone as I ruined my iPhone 5 last October. The phone arrived in a timely fashion, great appearance, but better yet it has been working flawlessly. Plan to get one for my husband.",4
They did such an incredible time. The phone got here before it was scheduled and is in tip top shape. Runs perfect and they are very efficient.Highly recommended!,5
"Going from an android to and iPhone there's much of a difference. I like the iPhone more, the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the screen cracks quickly. I've had the phone for 2 months and my screen is already cracked.",4
"You bought a phone that was supposed to be new and was refurbished, you send it me on a napkin whitout charger or accesories and when i return it rather than returning me 300 dollars that i pay for it, you only give me 200 dollar, abusive. Get unable to retur 80 percent at least.",1
"My iPhone purchase was easy to search & find what I was looking for. The process was secure and best of all, my phone was exactly what was stated in the description. It also arrived four days before the suggested arrival date. Awesome!",5
"I was very pleased at first with the iPhone 4s! After about two weeks the screen quit working but then a few days later it started working again. Now, so far so good. Working great! It may have been something I did, who knows? Thanks",4
Does everything that I want. I'm sure there are more sophisticated phones on the market but this phone is beyond my capacity to use all its functions. Well worth the price.,4
I chose this to replace a lost phone because of its comprehensive description which proved to be accurate. I had no trouble activating it and it seems to be functioning as expected. It came well packaged within the expected time frame.,5
"Phone looked great when it arrived, but when we went to activate it at the Verizon store, they said it couldn't connect to anything cellular. Completely defective, need to return now.",1
"The VERY best. Thanks Steve Wozniak for what YOU began and YOUR creative genius - Apple. Steve Jobs was a marketing genius so do not credit him with the genius behind Apple engineering. This is a FABULOUS phone! Thanks for ALL of the H-A-R-D work 1000 employees of ""Project Purple.""",4
"I am here to buy second-hand mobile phones, obviously open, repair, cell phone charge can only use continuously for an hour, most efficiency is 35, the inner problem still don't know how many goods, praise is so much, at the time said looks very new, bought, the screen is definitely not original factory and the screen has a small hole in the middle",1
"I got my phone even sooner than expected! I was very scared to buy something like this used. The only reason I didn't give it 5, was the charger. It came with a short and actually started smoking on the first night I used it. Kinda scary. Just replaced it and everything else works beautifully!",4
i ordered a brand new Iphone 4S but instead i was supplyed a very badly refurbished one. There are signs that this has been used before. The metallic side strip is damaged in more than two places.The authorized apple store says it has Chinese parts and it is badly refurbished,1
"I bought this phone as an unlocked phone but later found upon revving it found out that it was locked with Verizon . I felt cheated because I was not expecting this from Amazon , seller of the phones .",3
"Straight forward and good purchase. Only complaint is that the charger that was included with the phone is fragile and doesn't work. Needed to get a new charger, but overall I was happy with the purchase.",5
"i got an amazon gift card when i did my taxes...that was my first mistake. once i got the card, i had to spend it...i looked at phones and ordered a cheap iphone...but after i month i realised it was not coming...i have asked for my money back...",1
I purchased this item as a xmas gift. I must say the item arrived way begore schedule. I checked out the authenticity and all was good. Im very happy.,4
"On the phone while appearance a scratch and deficiency did not provide the directions, but does not affect the normal use, the price is very affordable.",5
"I was very nervous about ordering this phone USED and ONLINE. Unseen. But I received it, and it is in great condition. Came with an old case, but I had already ordered an otterbox, so I replaced it quickly. I also downloaded the new IOS. So happy with this phone. Happy with the delivery. I've had an iphone before, so it feels good to be back.",5
"I bought a iphone 4s for verizon,off mbc mobile,it didn't really say if it was new or used,but It came,very quickly,brand new in the box! Everything included. I was worried because of some of the reviews,because I was just using it for tracfone,and so far everything is great! Thanks! Definitely recommend!",5
"i ordered a ""refurbished"" phone... the phone i received is ""used""... it has scratches on the screen and noticeable imperfections on the case... i do not expect it to be perfect, but this product is not as described... please contact me for return or swap options...",1
I have tried contacting the seller numerous times about the phone echoing with incoming calls--we have tried re-setting the phone several times and it does not help.,1
I sold something bad did not come as the public did not come here in Venezuela released as he had written on their website so I really do not recommend it for anything other team was saying came back and used,1
"The mobile phone bought by me can not work in China no matter what method used. My friend is afraid of this phone is not a new one, but I bought it because it is a new one.",1
The phone works great I was scared at first for buying a phone on the internet but its great even when I thought it was the wrong phone and I messed up the were very polite and fast about my concern/ return request.,5
Great Phone! My iPhone 5 started dropping calls / not receiving calls / everything going to voicemail before my 2 years were up and Verizon couldn't do anything about it. So this is my replacement and I love it. Little slower than the 5 but better size and works.,5
I bouhgt one unit and after install the sink card... THIS PHONE IS REPORTED AS STONLEDDIAMOND WIRELESS did not responde to phone calls and no responsable...Unfotunatilly as it's a not PRIME product Amazone do not responded for neither.,1
"I received exactly what was promised, and in a timely manner. Recommend amazon to anyone. Will actually be purchasing another in the next couple of months.",5
We got an iPhone 4S and are very happy with the product. It came in an unopened package as advertised. We took it to Verizon and had no trouble getting our number transferred to it. Would definitely buy from these guys again.,5
I got this iPhone right on time but there were many problems with that. Camera didn't work. All information from previous owner was their. Basically seller didn't clean up the phone and everything such as email contact numbers and etc we're there. I return the item and got my money back.,2
"I've had this phone for a few months now and I'm sop glad I made the swatch its pretty reliably and i don't have a lot of problems with it, Plus I was able to keep my current number which was a added bonus and it was cheaper than going though the Verizon store.",4
"I was seriously expecting a stolen phone because of the price, or at least an extremely abused phone. I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived in great condition and worked like a champ. The phone arrived with a new charging cable and a wall adapter.",5
I have a 5S for work so I wanted to pick this one up for personal use. I was surprised how quickly it linked with my iPad. The seller had it at my door in 3 days!,5
"The phone I received is in great shape, but it is a GSM phone and will not work on Verizon. I am hoping this review will lead Amazon to change the product description.",3
"I was disappointed with the size of the damage on the top of the screen. A large part of the screen is missing. It had said there was a crack, but it's more like a chunck of the screen fell out.",2
I received the Apple iPhone on time and the phone arrived as it was described. There were no visible scratches or anything. Dan was very helpful when it came to answering questions about the phone. Thanks!,5
"Product came as described, in excellent condition. Standard shipping was very fast. Ordered on the 12th and got the 15th. Got email same day I ordered saying it already shipped. Set up with Verizon already, and working great! Came set back to factor settings ready to go. Very pleased.",5
"This phone would not completely charge....ever! If it was as much as 50% charged and I used it to take a picture or send a message, the charge would drop to zero. I returned it and the seller gave me a full refund. Just a lemon, I guess!",1
I purchased this for my neice because the one I bought for my son at Christmas from this same seller was great! It arrived just like new in case with charger and shrink wrapped- presented like new. I was so impressed. I will purchase from this seller again if needed!,5
"I was very unsatisfied with this product when I received it. It was not a 4S at all, as advertised. I was purchasing this from a private party though. I was however very pleased with Amazon with their rapid response to my complaint. I notified Amazon as soon I received this product and they refunded my money.",1
This company was truly on the roll. The phone looked brand new. The order was at my door in about 3 days. They also responded to my questions right away before I made the purchase and that made me fill even better about ordering from this company. I up the phone will function as well as this companies service. :),5
This purchase exceeded my expectations. I was a little afraid of buying a phone other than new but this phone was in great shape and I had no problems with the hook up.,5
"good, buy iphone 4s which line the place you do not take'm from Venezuela, the same as when you bought it told me that it was released for all the online right now as I have my iphone paperweight ..... I hope your reply as soon as possible.",1
"Very happy with this purchase. Works with all my iPod equipments, plugs and chargers. The 5s as I understand it has different plugs so this was better for me.",5
this turned out to be counterfeit. after multiple problems took it to Apple Store to be fixed and they showed me all the fake Chinese parts with red writing on them... was still registered to some other woman in another state. Super sketchy and a pain in the butt experience. oh and i phones suck. I dropped it and the screen cracked after 2 weeks.,1
Product arrived on time and as advertised. Purchased this as a back up phone for my wife. This was purchased from there Amazon Warehouse clearance returns and it worked perfectly. Got a great deal too!,4
"Phone is not unlocked as sold. Unfortunately as I left for the UK shortly after buying it, I have misssed my return window. Next time I'll set fire to $200 instead. BUYER BEWARE.",1
Phone came in excellent condition. Shipping was quicker than posted. I got this phone for my son who broke his old one.....as of now he seems pleased with his replacement. Also came with the usb cable.,5
"Phone works fine with everything, just the battery issue, it dies too quickly. I dont know if its all 4s or just this one. Over all the phone is fine. Thanks.",4
"After not having good luck with the first phone I ordered, I was very happy with this phone. The phone's condition is just as expected. Used but in very good condition.",5
"The phone arrived with all of the original packaging and materials. The earbuds and charger appeared to be brand new. The phone itself had no marks whatsoever and appeared to be barely ""used"". It was as described.I am still getting used to an iPhone after being a Droid user, but the phone itself and the seller were just as advertised.",5
"You'll need to carefully inspect items from this seller as soon as they arrive. One of the iPhones I bought definitely had a defective battery, and I caught that early on and sent I back for repair. Now I see that the black phone's battery won't even last through the day, and will need to be replaced, also.",3
"My hubby is an old dinosaur who didn't want to give up his Blackberry, my sons and I purchased the refurbished iPhone 4 and now he's in love with the phone which arrived promptly and in excellent condition.",5
"The phone came so fast, like within a week. It was shipped right after the holidays. It has the same description like stated. Clean, co scratches. It was so frustrating when my phone got stolen on Christmas week. So I was looking and searching to buy a phone with an affordable price. The price was good and I needed a phone.",5
"Came just as advertised brand new! Was a Xmas present to my daughter. Got it set up and works just great , I already have 2 others so I knew what to expect and seller was very quick on delivery. Would buy again!",5
"I received it and after a day of use it immediately start freezing and having ""command delays"" like I'll press ""safari"" and it'll take a min or 2 to come up and I'll get contacts instead so yeah.",1
"The phone shipped fast, and was in just out of the box condition. 100% worth the $100, and saved quite a bit as oppose to buying a 5s or 6 in like condition.",5
This listing is deceiving. I just got off the phone with Apple to find out the device was purchased back in October not June as my purchase order was made. This makes a difference in the warranty as the device you are purchasing may not be under standard warranty or may be previously used.,1
"When I tried to activate the phone, I was told the phone had been reported lost or stolen, so obviously could not be used. The only positive thing I can say is that the seller did refund the purchase with minimal hassle.",1
"I previously had an iPhone 4, but the device had a ""Mind of it's own"": the screen would go ""black"" then come back on at will. I tried all software resets, but, I bought this used iPhone 4S for less than having the the older model repaired.",5
"Got to me in great timing, was hekoed quickly and efficiently when a problem arose with activting it. It's like brand new, I could recommend the store to anyone, great quality in everthing! Thank You!",5
"Bought this to replace a stolen phone.Hoping to fill my contact, and longer, with this replacement phone.Bad luck with a bad replacement phone.Ripped off twice.",2
"I received my iphone 4s within 3 days and in very good condition as it was described in the ad. It was almost brand new and no cosmetic blemishes whatsoever. When I went to activate the phone on my existing Verizon account there were no issues at all, everything worked out wonderfully!. I'm very satisfied",5
"Although purchased through a company that stated that they ensure the phone worked... there was still a number attached to it and therefore could not be activated. I had to return the phone. Still waiting on credit, but it has only been a little more than a week.",1
I have had this phone for 6 months now and it is still great. Considering an upgrade to the 6 but I am only holding off because i LOVE this one so much :),5
Box ID numbers belonged to a phone owned & active under another persons account. Plus somebody's personal info was not cleared or phone not reset . Verizon customer service helped find the true ID in the phone itself & got it activated.,3
"DO NOT DO BUY. This company is operated by thieves. Like many others, the phone I received did not meet the description. It was NOT a Verizon phone, nor was it unlocked. It was a sprint locked phone with previous users data! Spend a few more dollars and get something that works. Stay far away, learn from my mistake.",1
It worked for a couple weeks and then one of the speakers went out on it. No one can hear me talk on the phone unless I have it on speaker phone. Pain. In. The. Butt. I went from one broken phone to another. Not exactly pleased with that.,3
"After going from an iPhone 4 to a Samsung Galaxy 4, I decided within 6 months to go back to an iPhone. Apple really knows how to do it right and I will continue to be an iPhone fan.",4
The phone arrived as expected but the phone could not work on the Verizon network. I had to return the phone. The seller processed the return with no problem,1
"Without adding any apps, battery life lasted for maybe three quarters of a day. Had to use speaker or headphones to place or receive voice calls as normal ear speaker did not work.",2
"Sadly I had three of these phones that were marketed as brand new but when I had trouble with them and took them to verizon, Because it didn't work right, I was told I was the third person that had activated the phone.",1
"Rec'd what was sold as a brand new iPhone 4s, looks real. Verizon was unable to connect to the phone they said it must be ""locked by a 3rd party"". Apple was unable to connect to the phone, said it must be ""locked by a 3rd party"". I am afraid it is a bootlegged iPhone. I sent it back for a refund.",1
The phone was in good condition as described by the seller. The only problem I experienced was that I had difficulty with it the Wi-Fi and the screws to open the phone were stripped.,4
Product arrived quickly in box wrapped in original packaging from the factory. Works well so far. The price was wonderful. A great way to take my non tech savvy mother over to the world of a smart phone. I am pleased.,5
"please do not buy from this seller, the phone was not a new phone, it actually had been activated in Hong Kong years ago per Apple consultant. The box and phone had different MEID numbers. Neither Verizon nor Apple could activate the phone after 5 hours of trying everything they could.",1
I received the iPhone quickly and in GREAT shape. I could not even tell it was used. I would recommend buying a phone here to anyone and would do it again if I need/want too.,5
"I love my iPhone. I would recommend it to anyone. My only complaint is that Siri is not very intuitive and can be difficult, or sometimes impossible, to work correctly.",4
Worked really hard to find a price that would fit my budget and found this 16GB; which has enough space for my day to day activities. I would buy a second one if i could.,5
The phone was supposed to be new but it clearly wasn't. The battery is shot and drains itself completely in about an hour. And when I plugged it into the computer there was already someone's name associated with it.,2
"As it says, Verizon 4s ... I just went to verizon wireless to get my number transferred over, turns out I cant because it says in the general info that it is a sprint phone. So much for my excitement when I saw the package on my door step...",1
"Well, I ordered an iPhone 4s, but I got a plain iPhone 4. They look similar but, now I can't update to IOS 9 (stuck with IOS 7). I double checked and sure enough, I ordered a 4s, the delivery box said 4s, but the reseller packaged iPhone 4!",1
The giftee LOVE's this phone more than her friends 5S. She had no problem getting this phone activated with Verizon once she took it to a corporate store. Activation could not be done online and the one Verizon reseller she went to wouldn't touch it.,5
"When i received the phone I found that the top button did not click and now i have to use the accessibility feature to turn it off. Also the battery life, even when all apps are closed and screen is shut off, is horrible.",1
Great phone....exactly what I was looking for. Seller was spot on on what phone offered. More of a beginner iPhone but as an experienced user I like the simple ness.,5
"The phone arrived faster than the estimated delivery date..Great. Man lOl the phone was wrapped with paper towel, that was funny. Guess the person couldnt afford bubble wrap or whatever smh. I had to clean the iPhone, s*** was dirty as hell not Great. Other than that, the phone works fine for now. Battery dies fast to me though..",3
"I bought this to use on verizon and it is not activated for verizon so i have to send it back and get another phone. pain in the neck, i do not recommend this company.",1
"Everything we expect in a phone. The only issue is short battery life because it doesn't last a full day of use, we had to purchase a mobile charging station.",4
"This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. There are some things I wish came right on the phone and other things I wish I could just take off of the phone, but over all the phone works great and I love it nonetheless.",5
My iphone was stolen and I needed to replace it. This was a great price. Came in earlier than estimated. And the scratch that was on the back I couldn't even find. It looks brand new.,5
"just so so！What I bought is an used like new iphone 4s on the warehouse deals. The condition of the item is just so so, not very good or bad. But I used it well. It has not any problems.",3
"Simply put, the phone didn't work. I brought it to Apple who said it wasn't new (as advertised) but rather it was an old phone made to look new. They looked up the details and said they had dealings with this seller before. Don't buy from Vantage Cellular.",1
"I was pleasantly surprised my 13yr old lost his cell. Verizon wasn't able to provide another 4s at the time. I searched around and found a new phone never used before here on Amazon. It worked out very well, I was able to activate with Verizon no problems at all. I kept waiting for something to go wrong or fail with the phone but it didn't.",5
"4 plus year old model works as expected. Good solid feel. Replacing same era Windows phone that no longer plays all CNN and YouTube videos. There are also 10 apps on iPhone I use that are not available for Windows phone.Office ,Onenote, and Onedrive are all available on iPhone.",4
Great phone and a really good price. my husband is very pleased with this purchase and this is good because the 4s is our first iphone and we weren't sure if we would like it. Seller gave a product that met expectations and the shipping time was also great. Thank you,5
"Simply put, the phone didn't work. I brought it to Apple who said it wasn't new (as advertised) but rather it was an old phone made to look new. They looked up the details and said they had dealings with this seller before. Don't buy from Vantage Cellular.",1
"Wasnt sure what to expect when it said condition was acceptable. Very pleasantly surprised with a product that looks and performs like new! Worked out great, and would purchase again if the situation called for replacing the phone. Thanks!",5
"man i need to say you something about a telephone that i bought you, i was trying to unlocked my iphone 4 and when i tried they told me that the iphone 4 is stolen and i'm really disappointed with your services, you're a cheater!",1
"It works great I thought I was gonna get ripped off but I got what I wanted, no scratches perfectly good condition like new, I haven't activated it yet but I'm sure it'll go through.",5
"My son purchased this phone. we verified that it was not stolen.. however after it arrived and we went to Verizon to turn it on and it was reported stolen.. we received a full refund, but what a hassle",1
"Absolutely love my iPhone 4S!! I am so impressed with how accurate it was to the dealer's add, it is like brand new and I love Amazon's dependable service!",5
"My son shattered the screen on his iPhone 4, and we were able to purchase this 4S at a bargain price. It came in perfect condition, you would think it was brand new, and it continues to perform flawlessly. Amazon has done it again!",5
"The IPhone I ordered has proven to be just as good as the other I had prior to this purchase. It does sometimes get a little glitchy when navigating, but it's nothing that impacts performance.",4
"Phone works great and just as promised on the discription, the only problem was I paid extra for 2 day shipping and it actually took a week but other then the wait everything came as expected",5
"Although the description doesn't say it's a new phone, it doesn't say it's a used one either, the one I got had all kinds of information from the previous owner. I don't have a problem buying a refurb, but I'd like to pay the price of one, not a slightly lower price than brand new one. So beware, you may be looking to buy a used phone.",1
Happybook1 is a trustworthy company .I have bought two iPhone 4S from happybook 1 and I have never had a problem with the phones . What ever Happybook1 sells it will work like it is brand new . Happybook 1 is a outstanding company .,5
"I try to activate the iphone 4s in front of the Verizon wireless, but the service told me that the iphone 4s I just bought from Werehouse Deal is a stolen one!!!!",1
Exactly as published! I utilize the speech option for texting and it functions flawlessly 80% of the time. I am comfortable with older technology for the savings aspect and hate the idea that we need to discard manufactured products on a habitual basis. I hope to get many many years service out of a phone.,5
"About 2 weeks after receiving this phone it stopped working, wouldn't shut off, froze,wouldn't take pictures. I am extremely unhappy with this product. When I asked for a refund within the 30 day guarantee I never got a response.",1
"Phone came as described, have faith that Amazon always provides quality products. Phone came with new ear buds and charging cables / brick. Phone was near flawless and made a 12 Yo a very happy camper on his birthday.",5
"""I bought TWO of these phones which CLEARLY states Verizon. I received them and it is for VIRGIN mobile. Reading through the other reviews it looks like there are about 5 of us in recent days. Not only will I be returning it I'm letting Amazon know how wrong and misleading your advertising.",1
This was a gift for my son and he LOVES it. He said he was surprised what great shape it was in. The shipping materials could have been better but the phone came through in just the padded envelope without a scratch.,5
"This iPhone was exactly as depicted. At first I was skeptical buying an iPhone off Amazon but it worked and at a great price. When I went to charge the iPhone it didn't turn on so I contacted the seller and they agreed to take it back. Luckily I tried a different charging cable, the one they provided didn't work.the phone works great",5
"Fantastic phone. Perfect size,fits in pocket. Like the location of charging port. Easy to navigate,and don't need fingerprint to log on. Wish I phone 5 was built like this",5
"There wasn't anything in the description that I saw that said the power button was sticking so I had to spend another $65 dollars to get it fixed, had I known that before I bought it I wouldn't have bought it.",1
"A month ago I bought them to you a cell phone, but I requested a new Iphone and you sent me a used Iphone. It seems to me that you are swindlers. I need you to solve the situation and send me back to my new phone.",1
"There is an issue with the wifi chip not working which is common with a lot of 4S's. Unfortunately, there is no way of fixing it so you'd going to end up with a phone that will only be able to use data.",1
"Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (Black) - Verizon ...I Recieved my iPhone on time and It looked like it was brand new. The phone was still in the original box factory sealed, but the battery life sucks! It won't hardly hold a charge at all. Other then that it is exactly what I expected.",4
"Shipped on time, in great condition. Note that with Verizon, you cannot change carriers after you activate it, so if you weren't planning on going with Verizon choose a different phone with the carrier you want to stick with. Otherwise great option if your looking into iPhones!",4
"I got the 16g black iPhone 4S, and it is amazing. It arrived super fast, and in brand new condition. I was able to take it to Verizon and activate it no problem. They did a fantastic job, and I would recommend them to anyone.",5
Product was not cleaned well. Phone speaker doesn't work well (cannot hear people when making phone calls; you have to use an external earpiece. and AUX outlet is testy.,2
I have a 5S for work so I wanted to pick this one up for personal use. I was surprised how quickly it linked with my iPad. The seller had it at my door in 3 days!,5
"I bought this as a replacement iPhone, passing one to my daughter. It's different to the iPhone 5, but was in great condition and has worked flawlessly since.I'll be interested to see how it looks one iOS 8 is installed.",5
Phone was what I expected. It came with ios 6.1.3 and battery life was kind of short. After updating to 7.1.2 battery life has improved by at least 50%.,5
"good, buy iphone 4s which line the place you do not take'm from Venezuela, the same as when you bought it told me that it was released for all the online right now as I have my iphone paperweight ..... I hope your reply as soon as possible.",1

I purchased this item as a xmas gift. I must say the item arrived way begore schedule. I checked out the authenticity and all was good. Im very happy.,4
"I buy it unlock the phone to find it, but when it is not received Unlocked, I need to pay an additional $ 56 to unlock it.Although it looks very good.",3
Thanks so much for a smooth purchase and A+ service. Will be giving this phone to my sister for christmas and am very stoked to have gotten such a great product at such a reasonable price. Cheers!,5

"I needed a replacement phone as I ruined my iPhone 5 last October. The phone arrived in a timely fashion, great appearance, but better yet it has been working flawlessly. Plan to get one for my husband.",4
They did such an incredible time. The phone got here before it was scheduled and is in tip top shape. Runs perfect and they are very efficient.Highly recommended!,5
"Going from an android to and iPhone there's much of a difference. I like the iPhone more, the only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the screen cracks quickly. I've had the phone for 2 months and my screen is already cracked.",4
"You bought a phone that was supposed to be new and was refurbished, you send it me on a napkin whitout charger or accesories and when i return it rather than returning me 300 dollars that i pay for it, you only give me 200 dollar, abusive. Get unable to retur 80 percent at least.",1
"just so so！What I bought is an used like new iphone 4s on the warehouse deals. The condition of the item is just so so, not very good or bad. But I used it well. It has not any problems.",3
"The phone is received was more than excessively scratched up, it took Verizon 2 hours to activate it, and it's overheating as we speak in my hand. I've literally had it activated for all of 5 hours fully charged it and it's battery is already dead. The description is nothing like what I received this morning. I'm beyond pissed.",1
These phone keeps on turning it self off and the battery life last on like 3 hours or less. So if there is any one who knows what up let me know it a it's a hassle to return it.,1
I will never shop at amazon again to this date I still cannot use the phone I purchased because there was no user name and pass word to unlocked the device and to make things worst the website that was provided to unlocked the phone was not able to do so,1
"I have enough to buy a 4S product performance is perfect, the Internet phone messages are very good. Very grateful to the U.S. Amazon warehouse to give me such a perfect product.",5
Everything is good and as expected. Nothing wrong with the phone just switched it recently and having a blast downloading new apps with new and improved phone and software that comes with it.,4
"The first phone I received was a turned in gov't. phone with a bad battery, the second phone was an a.t.t. phone. I sent them both back and went back to my ravine flip phone that always works. So much for upgrades!",1
"I bought this phone for my daughter's 15th birthday. She loves it! It arrived in pristine condition, we easily activated it at our local Verizon store, and it has been working perfectly ever since. The seller provided great follow up to our order. I would absolutely purchase from this seller again. :)",5
"The truth is, they are both fabulous pieces of equipment that we are all very lucky to have in our lives. I actually remember having a 4 digit phone number and 5 people sharing the same line!! But, for reasons subtle which I am not even totally conscious of, I love my iPhone and I didn't love my Android.",5
"the product was not required because I'm blocked with the telephony company verizon, I try to unlock it but it is very expensive and keep him. now the battery does not work and not to do, I lost my money, please tell me that I can do, if I can still return it. thanks",2
"I had a droid phone and had lots of problems. Verizon swapped it out 3 times and the problems never ceased. Got this phone and love it. No problems, no glitches and have signal. Love it!!",5
"Apple makes a great phone there is no doubt. I bought this for my daughter. It works flawlessly and smoothly. The big problem with Apple products are they are proprietary locked down. Even a charger costs $20.00, and the number of free apps is much smaller than android products.",4
"When I tried to activate the phone, I was told the phone had been reported lost or stolen, so obviously could not be used. The only positive thing I can say is that the seller did refund the purchase with minimal hassle.",1
"Apple is very proprietary. If you can deal with the mass limitations, even between other Apple products, it's a decent smartphone. It is hugely over priced though.",1
"When I received the iphone there was a crack on the back of the phone across the camera eye. It was mentioned in the description before I purchased the phone, it had no scratches or cracks. That statement is misleading. I would not use the vendor again. Thank you, pw",3
Very helpful when I had the issue and then phone started working on its own. When I originally contacted them I was not happy with the response but as soon as I wrote the review they were more than happy to help me with my issue and it was corrected quickly.,4
"The phone is in like new condition. Has a small scratch on the screen that's barely noticeable, but other than that the phone has been very good to me.",5
"Its a pretty nice phone, but in my case I couldn't stand it. I bought this iPhone to be a 'backup' if you will. I have the Galaxy S 3, and switching to the iPhone (which isn't even 4G) is a major downgrade.",3
"I sent a msg to the place that i purchased the iphone saying that the phone is an iphone 4 and not an iphone 4s as i puchased for, i didnt get any answer from it. I am really upset about it. i want my money of the difference back!!! I am from Argentina and i cant exchange the phone but i want the money of the difference in my credit card back.",1
I liked the iphone but after one month I found that its one speaker is not working. I was thinking that everything would be fine because when I was shopping on Amazon there was written that we have tested this item and every thing is working fine. There was a scratch on the body also.,3
"The iphone cycled upon purchase, so I upgraded to the latest iOS. After that, the Wifi was grayed out so we couldn't actually turn it on or off. Turns out, tons of people have this problem. Returned it.",1
"Second IPhone I've ordered from Planet Mobile. Both were gifts for others and they both loved their phones. No issues activating. Shipped and received pretty quickly, less than 5 business days in each case.",5
"Phone is not unlocked as sold. Unfortunately as I left for the UK shortly after buying it, I have misssed my return window. Next time I'll set fire to $200 instead. BUYER BEWARE.",1
Phone came in excellent condition. Shipping was quicker than posted. I got this phone for my son who broke his old one.....as of now he seems pleased with his replacement. Also came with the usb cable.,5
"Phone looked great when it arrived, but when we went to activate it at the Verizon store, they said it couldn't connect to anything cellular. Completely defective, need to return now.",1
"The VERY best. Thanks Steve Wozniak for what YOU began and YOUR creative genius - Apple. Steve Jobs was a marketing genius so do not credit him with the genius behind Apple engineering. This is a FABULOUS phone! Thanks for ALL of the H-A-R-D work 1000 employees of ""Project Purple.""",4
"I am here to buy second-hand mobile phones, obviously open, repair, cell phone charge can only use continuously for an hour, most efficiency is 35, the inner problem still don't know how many goods, praise is so much, at the time said looks very new, bought, the screen is definitely not original factory and the screen has a small hole in the middle",1
I sold something bad did not come as the public did not come here in Venezuela released as he had written on their website so I really do not recommend it for anything other team was saying came back and used,1
"The mobile phone bought by me can not work in China no matter what method used. My friend is afraid of this phone is not a new one, but I bought it because it is a new one.",1
"Perfect condition. Came in a different phone box, but that didn't matter to me. Was able to bring to Verizon, and get info transferred without a hitch. And was able to skip the added on monthly fees if I would have bought the same phone from Verizon saving us hundreds of dollars each year for the next two years.",5
"I'm glad I got it at a cheap price and its a working phone, but, both sides of my camera does it focus and it's really hard for me knowing that I take photos for a living and would like to use my phone once in a while.",2
"I was disappointed with the size of the damage on the top of the screen. A large part of the screen is missing. It had said there was a crack, but it's more like a chunck of the screen fell out.",2
I received the Apple iPhone on time and the phone arrived as it was described. There were no visible scratches or anything. Dan was very helpful when it came to answering questions about the phone. Thanks!,5
"Product came as described, in excellent condition. Standard shipping was very fast. Ordered on the 12th and got the 15th. Got email same day I ordered saying it already shipped. Set up with Verizon already, and working great! Came set back to factor settings ready to go. Very pleased.",5
"This phone would not completely charge....ever! If it was as much as 50% charged and I used it to take a picture or send a message, the charge would drop to zero. I returned it and the seller gave me a full refund. Just a lemon, I guess!",1
The phone works great I was scared at first for buying a phone on the internet but its great even when I thought it was the wrong phone and I messed up the were very polite and fast about my concern/ return request.,5
Great Phone! My iPhone 5 started dropping calls / not receiving calls / everything going to voicemail before my 2 years were up and Verizon couldn't do anything about it. So this is my replacement and I love it. Little slower than the 5 but better size and works.,5
"I love this phone easy to use,don't like the Calendar layout as much as on my IPhone 3 but found another Planner app that works fine.The only downside is that the battery needs to be charged everyday,I was told by others later that this is a problem with this phone",4
"I was pleasantly surprised my 13yr old lost his cell. Verizon wasn't able to provide another 4s at the time. I searched around and found a new phone never used before here on Amazon. It worked out very well, I was able to activate with Verizon no problems at all. I kept waiting for something to go wrong or fail with the phone but it didn't.",5
"4 plus year old model works as expected. Good solid feel. Replacing same era Windows phone that no longer plays all CNN and YouTube videos. There are also 10 apps on iPhone I use that are not available for Windows phone.Office ,Onenote, and Onedrive are all available on iPhone.",4
"After grandson's 5C phone got left in his baseball pants and went through the wash, we got him the 4S phone. The phone arrived in 2 days and he is very happy with it.",5
This phone was not originally Verizon aand for the money that was paid I can't get on the internet unless I am somewhere where someone has WiFi. Very disappointing .,1
You can't hear from ear piece and the call screen disappears and every once in a while letters and numbers flicker while in a call phone had issues when shipped,2
"Product was defective, not charging properly. Battery drains immediately even while on standby. Something that shouldn't have been sold to us. People just like to sell you anything even if they are aware of it being defective.",1
Within 2 weeks the charger stopped working....Seems like it has a bad battery or something....cuts off at 40%....you can charge for hours will not fully charge...not what I expected....,1
the product itself was good however the battery is not holding a charge and I found out from Apple that the phone from the seller was not new as advertised but previously owned by someone else so therefore out of the warranty.,4
Extremely Disappointed since when in the phone the person I was talking to couldn't understand what I was saying. The connection was not clear constantly.,1
"Always been an apple person, 👍🏽 bought this iphone because I broke my old iPhone 6. 😔 shipping was fast ! Phone works great! Brand new! I was hesitant about purchasing this phone but I'm glad I did!",5
I bought a iPhone4s from the amazon in last month.however I'm terriblly disappointed with the item. becaus the IMEI of this iphone indicate that：013189006597997 is a serial number for a product that has been replaced .It means this iphone4s is not a new one，and there is no any product information about this iphone4s in the apple official website.,1
"Great phone everything worked when I got it, idk if it was worn out or my husband just was hard on it but the speaker only worked for about 2 months And now it has to be on speaker to hear, but when we got it, it was in perfect working order, I would buy again",4
"This phone is VERIZON. It is very upsetting to wait for an iphone and then when you receive item, it is the incorrect phone. Paying this much for a phone and getting the wrong phone that you paid for is beyond upsetting.",1
"Until now this has been the best purchase I have made because the phone greatly exceeded my expectations. I want the brand continues, and it rests in innovate and offer a fair price the best phone.",5
"The iphone had small damage,but Amazon said the phone was like news.I don't know if they will not give me compensation, but I can only say that I didn't like their products",2
"Its a very nice phone. It's got a very small and light scratch on the top screen, but not very noticeable especially when the phone is turned on it looks perfect.",4
"I really hesitated ordering the phone used and on line. I was AMAZED and very fortunate to have gotten such a GREAT phone in perfect condition!!! I would definitely buy from this seller again! I was truly very surprised and oh, SO happy with my new iPhone 4S! Thank you very much for the honest description that was REALLY true.",5
"I am very happy with my iPhone 4s but you must know that in order for Siri to work you need to have WiFi available, other wise it will just be like the iPhone 4.I was disappointed about that!",5
If I could I wouldn't even give this one star. A few weeks after getting the phone the screen started glitching & eventually was one big blue screen with flashing lines through it.. I am leaving a review now bc amazon requested me to update my reviews on things I have purchased.I am majorly displeased with this transaction.,1
I bought from the little section that says new and used I paid 80.00 and paid extra for one day shipping it said it was in good condition but there is no scratches or any marks or scuffs it is in perfect condition I am very pleased with my order and it works great for AT&T,5
"The phone came with defects also get blocked, now the phone does not work and I want to know how to do to fix it since it is under warranty since it was bought with the intention to be a great phone and good for no waiting for your comments thanks.",1
"After a month of using it, it broke and won't turn on. I asked the Apple if they can fix it and they said NO because it's already been open. I suggest for those people who are thinking about not to buy it. Just wasted my money on this one but i can not return it anymore.",1
Perfect condition the description was may have small scratches... No scratches I immediately put it into a case to protect it. Works fine I may have to get a battery though. Not at big deal.,5
"I bought this for my mother to use when we switched carriers. It was new, as advertised, and a year later, still in perfect working order. For a lot less in a smaller package, the 4S is still a darn good iPhone.",5
it cracked when it just slipped from my hand ( not even 5 mtr distance fall ) . I have been using Iphones for years and several I products which are being used by kids heavily on a daily basis . This 4S does not seems to be the original iPhone product .,1
"I don't think the phone I received was refurbished, the battery life is terrible. I feel I wasted my money. Also, the earbuds the phone came with are a cheap copy of apple earbuds. Not great.",1
"I added another 4S to my cellphone collection. I like the small size, the features and it does everything that I need in a phone! Some like other brands, but I pick Apple every time! The ease in connectivity between my iPad, and MacAir is amazing.",5
"i have had an IPhone 4 previously and wanted to have it again.I knew what I was purchasing and it is exactly what i wanted.It accomplishes everything I need.,with simplicity to use.",4
"Excellent condition and exactly as described. Excellent seller. Phone was, clean, exactly like new, well taken care of and wrapped efficiently. Was not listed to be in an original box, but was, with charger and ear plugs. Very pleased.",5
"Much faster than the 3gs (but then what isn't )waited to the end to upgrade, put IOS 7.1 on it,and it's great. FAST, with allot of capabilites I didn't have before.Great battery life, and really happy at the upgrade....",5
Yeah just make sure you buy or have an AT&T Sim card...you can get one from Amazon for like a buck and it will activate the iPhone just fine...and then you could even do what I did and get the GoPhone Sim and have unlimited texting a 250 min voice for $25/month. Really cheap bro.,5
I'm very satisfied with the product since it's a great phone and I havent had any problem with it. The service was excellent since the phone arrive earlier than expected in its sealed package exactly as it said in the product description. I strongly reccommend buying it!,5
I myself is a HUGE apple fan and when i purchased the 4S i was so excited. I ordered the product with overnight shipping and it came a day early it came in its box and it had no marks on it. it was the best phone ever i highly recommend it.,5
Fast and reliable. Shipped quickly and the product was exactly as described by seller. works great and is in perfect condition. I have had no problems with the cell phone and my sim card slipped right in and worked! Highly recommend for someone looking for a great smartphone.,5
"I ordered this iphone 4s on September 9th, 2014. I got it on the day of September 10th,2014. This came in PERFECT CONDITION. Brand new. I would recommend it to all Apple users!~Elizabeth A. *College Student*",5
After only one month of owning this phone I am having trouble getting it to charge. It will only charge on my docking station at home which is very inconvenient. I am worried that it is going to stop charging all together. Very disappointed as it claimed to be new and is now not returnable.,1
"This has been the BEST PHONE!!! I did buy the Griffin case for my daughter but it has survived my teenage daughter's abuse and keeps on a ticking! She won't give this phone up no matter how I try, offered to trade her my kindle fire phone, with a larger screen, still won't budge!!!",5
Absolutely great product amazon never fails!we bought two one black one white and the both look brand new and work great these are a steal thanks again amazon!!!,5
"Phone came with a charger with a pair of headphones. The phone was in VERY GOOD condition. Very, very small and few scratches on the back and none on the front of the phone. This phone was faster than my other friend's iPhone 4S, which I found strange. It had no lag on iOS 7. I upgraded to a 5C recently and I love it also.",5
"We bought this Iphone because it was much cheaper than a new one. The phone is in great shape, and appears to be working great! So far, happy with it!",5
"The phone works great and came before the delivery date but.... It didn't come in its original box, it didn't come with a manual which makes me think it was used when I ordered a new phone and the card part to the charger was broke overall I will never buy electronics on amazon again but the phone is okay it works.",3
"This phone came with a scratch on the front screen, something is loose and when you shake the phone gently back and forth, you can actually hear something rattling inside. Also, the internal speaker cuts in and out quite often. Would not buy from this seller again. :(",2
After only one month of owning this phone I am having trouble getting it to charge. It will only charge on my docking station at home which is very inconvenient. I am worried that it is going to stop charging all together. Very disappointed as it claimed to be new and is now not returnable.,1
Just as they said I love this is my first iphone and I am very very happy that I made this choice this phone is in perfect condition nothing negative to say o bout it Thank you very much.,5
"I ordered an Apple iPhone 4S 16GB (White) - AT&T from Warehouse Deals @amazon. But, I received a verizon one and the cellphone has been sent to China. I can't use it! I think Warehouse Deals cheating me! I hate it! I will return it, Amazon must explain the reason and compensate for the posting fee and tax!",1
"I bought this phone and since it cost above U$D 500, did not expect to be locked .I am out the USA and can not use in any other carrier .Do not buy any Iphone for this price if it is locked, since you can get for the same price unlocked.",1
"Simply Superb :) The cameera,apps and features are really good and liked it. I was using other brand phone but after this really its amazing with superb quality. Nice experience.",5
"I purchased an I phone 4s, it was advertise as new, I paid for the price of new, but instead I received a used phone. It works fine but the ad is very misleading or call it fraud.",1
just had to have it even though my upgrade was not for another 6 months got it early worked great and then when my upgread came up got me the samsung and gave this one to my hubby he was happy too,5
This rating goes to the seller. i loved the phone it came in good condition and almost new. the reason why it took me so long to do a review is because i wanted to use the phone for a while. so far the phone is still in good shape and looks like it will stay like this for a longer period of time.,5
"The iPhone I got was at my door in two days! I was very impressed, until I opened the box and popped out the Sim Card. Verizon iPhone, not AT&T like the description would suggest. Phone was in amazing condition, and I'm so mad to have to send it back!!",2
"I selected product in unlocked category and selected this model.... When i recived this product i try to use in another country and no worked beacause is block to at&t.... I pay $400,00 to buy a iphone 4 blocked ? You are crazy ?",1
"Surprised that this phone supposed to be bought as used come locked to the AT & T network. Yet to figure out what to do with them now, but I need you guys to help out to unlock them..",1
"The phone gave an error 29 during a software update, after talking to an apple Tech he informed me it was because the battery was not apple certified.",1
"He wouldn't willing to help us with the phone. The phone ended up being iCloud locked, so it wasn't able to a citrate. Don't buy things from him. He's not reliable.",1
I was nervous to buy a refurb phone online but this one came exactly as described and shipping was very fast. The phone is on great shape. It needs to be charged daily but what phone doesn't?,5
"This is one of the best purchases I've ever made. I don't watch videos or play many games on my phone so this is just perfect for keeping my time and information organized and at my fingertips. It came in excellent condition and my carrier, Consumer Cellular, provided a no charge sim card and it worked right off the bat!",5
The price was right... Arrived when they said it would (5-7 days) Received prior to Christmas - My Daughter is VERY HAPPY with her new iPhone 4S 16GB. Would recommend to anyone that needs a new phone,5
"I'll be honset, I was a little sceptical when i first ordered this phone ( i figured it was going to be broken or a piece of crap or even never show up) but it works perfectly. And i got it for a good price too. ATT wanted 500 for the same phone and i paid about half of that! I love it!",5
Yeah just make sure you buy or have an AT&T Sim card...you can get one from Amazon for like a buck and it will activate the iPhone just fine...and then you could even do what I did and get the GoPhone Sim and have unlimited texting a 250 min voice for $25/month. Really cheap bro.,5

"For the most part this phone works fine except it doesn't hold a charge that long and needs to be plugged in frequently. Also, the person who sold never took his name off it so when my daughter calls his name pops up and AT&T had to do some work to switch it over to her. This is my teenage daughters first phone and she is happy with it.",4
The phone is great and exaclty as the description said. Would recommend this seller. I bought 2 for my parents they are happy and the phones are really new. Thanks again I am so happy.,5
Very happy with my iphone 4s...i ordered on the 16 and got it today...I haven't try the service yet cuz I want to used it in C.V hopefully it will work with no problems... it is totally unlocked brand new just love it...RECOMMENDED!!,5
"I bought 2 phones as gifts and they were returned, embarrassing!The phone looks new and has all the accessories, but Its not GSM unlocked. It shows that its Verizon only unable to unlock it, trying to return now.",1
This Iphone was great... it was new and I love it...it came on time..I reccomend all of you guys to buy a phone like this one.. there are no words to describe how good it was,5
"Ive had this phone for about 7 months now, so I can honestly say its pretty good! There are some speaker problems I got with mine, but it DID come unlocked as advertised. I have MetroPCS so the sim I got was put in with ease and within five minutes the iPhone was hooked up into the network. Would definitely buy again!",4
"This is an international purchase, the phone arrived one day ago and this does not meet my expectations , because the charger and battery not work, the battery lasts on the average of 2-3 hours. I thought I would be happy with it.Apple iPhone 4s 16GB Factory Unlocked GSM World Smartphone w/ Siri and iCloud - White",1
"I bought a used iphone 4s and arrived in very good condition, i am very happy, I've used these days and I have not had any problems, i hope it stays that way.",5
"Not happy at all, I am returning the phone. It's not compatible with Verizon ! Waited a week for the phone to go to my store to activate and use and it's only compatible with ATT",1
"Originally, I was unsure about this phone as the reviews aren't great. However, my phone came in great condition and so far am not having problems with it.",5
Problem of battery or phone ??? Obligate to charge it 4 or 5 time a day and the battery indicate 80% one minute later it 30% and when you plug it one second indicate charge 60%,1
Bought the phone but I need the previous owner itune login in order to use the iphone. Who can I contact to get this information or request a new one.,1
"The iPhone itself appeared to be near new. However, the sim tool and ear buds were missing, even though the copy clear states that all original accessories were included. Vendor will not provide.",2
Well this phone is breaking everyday like charger just broke left speaker don't work and when u talk on the phone I have to put it on speaker to hear something,2
"Phone works ok but, i received a broken charger? it was completely disconnected from the piece and my home button kinda sticks but other then that it is ok find out tomorrow if cricket accepts it.",3
To my relief my phone worked fine. Ironically I could not activate on Verizon as a prepaid phone but it worked fine with Tracfone. I do not have any battery issues. This is just a backup phone anyway. It is not being used as a primary phone. I use it while I travel so I don't risk losing the more expensive version of this phone,5
The phone looks brand new! There are no scratches anywhere. The charger was even wrapped as the new ones! I've tried it with my at&t unlocked sim card and with an international sim card and it works perfectly so far.,5
"In the publication you say the cellphone have all the originals accessories, you only send me the cellphone with a not original charger, you don't send me headphones. I need comunicate with the you.",2
"This phone worked great....until I went to purchase service from a no contract company, and they informed me that this phone was not on their list of unlocked phones. It's stuck on a Verizon Pre-Paid plan. My advice, keep looking.",1
The phone looks great and was well packaged. At first I was concerned that the phone was not fully unlocked because it was a verizon phone but everything works great. I dont know why some customers had issues with this phone being an old verizon phone unless they just never tried putting a sim card in it but im satisfied with everything,5
"On the amazon site, it listed it as a new phone rather than refurbished. Although I wouldn't expect a new phone that is so dated, it should have been listed as refurbished. The phone itself is fine and works well.",4
Came on time loved it looks even bigger than expected...having turned it on as yet but I'm blown over thought it would have looked bad....only thing I wish it came with the headphone and manual that wud a have been a plus buuuuttttt love love love my new iPhone thanks amazon love yah.......,5
The iphone 4S was in pristine condition even though the description may not claim so. Also it was unlocked and I checked to see that it worked in AT&T. I sent the phone to India for use on the GSM network over there. I am very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended for the price. I paid $85 in July 2016.,5
Doesn't have enough space. I only have about 30 pictures and it won't let me take anymore. Also have to delete texts constantly. I haven't downloaded any apps.,2
Is in perfect condition and is unlocked. all ports work well. It is just as fast as my other iPhone 4s was and can download the current iSO. only problem is that the phone gets really hot really quickly and the battery seems to run out a little faster than normal. comes in a fancy box with a clear top and a charger.,4
It came on time was happy about it but the charger was not the right one sad can't use it. The surface looks good no scratches but the speaker is not working well when making a call .,3
The telephone is in exquisite condition. Also everything is wonderful in regards to the performance of the telephone. Should the need occur in the future...there will not be any hesitation for me to purchase another telephone by using Amazon.com.,5
"Though the product is good but the battery worked pathetic. I had to charge the phone three times a day. If a phone is factory refurbished, then don't they check the battery quality? Anyway, I returned the product in a week.",1
Sometimes one can be a little skeptical when purchasing a refurbished iphone. I had 2 positive experience with iphone I bought from this company. The iphone has been working flawlessly.,5
"I love this phone. I think that, besides the functionality, I really like how this sturdy this phone is---with just the right amount of weight to it. If something happens to my phone, I will buy this model again.",5
I love it a lot! The iPhone 4/4S is my favorite designed Apple phone yet. I love everything about it despite not being able to upgrade passed IOS 9.3.,4
"It came exactly when they said it would and the phone looks brand new. So far, the only problem I've had with it is that it froze on me once, but other than that I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.",4
"Phone came in awesome condition with no scratches or dents in it. Battery life was amazing as well! I highly recommend you get this phone! This phone comes already with ios 9. Includes with- Refurbished Unlocked iPhone 4S with built in iCloud, Charging cable with plugThis was a good deal and no other price can beat this!",5
DO NOT BUY THIS IPHONE !I've had it for two weeks and is a piece of junk:-The audio does not work most of the time (especially when using headphones).-It does not connect to Wi-Fi at times.-Safari app crashes constantly.-Battery runs out quickly once it reaches 50 %. Do not buy it. Be smart and buy a new one. I am returning this piece of junk.,1
"Was supposed to be gsm unlocked phone, turns out it was for sprint. So it doesn't work for what i need, eventhough it stated it was for those networks in the description!!!!",1
"Hello! I am not fully satisfied with this items. one of the phone Home button is difficult to operate. In addition to this any of these phone not complete set.I didn't get earphone(ear plug) for any of them. Do you think , it is acceptable?",3
Llego well but with the default screen calls chokes and reheated too when charging the battery would give me warranty then could not make the claim before because just a week ago I get the product because I am from Venezuela and slow as I can solve this problem?,1
Phones appear to be in good condition. Not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap. The USB cable came apart while charging the first time. Reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so I just went to find my own replacement Hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger....,3
"not buying! It does not work: does not play audio from videos or ring when they call, no charge! and I am now in Colombia and I can not return it! And Amazon is not responding!",1
"Phone was not unlocked.I was referred to Apple. Apple said, 2 service techs, the phone was still locked to the Cloud. The prices quoted to have device unlocked in the $50 to $200 range. With no guarantee of success.Due to circumstances, the phone was a gift to someone out of the country, I am out the money.",1
Such a worst experience with this buy. This phone is not unlocked and battery is draining out like anything. Keep away from this dealer.I bought another 4s unlocked from lukki_lukki dealer and it's unlocked and in perfect shape.Returning this! !,1
Lasted for around 27 days now it won't hold a charge. I loved it when it first game updated it to ios 9.1.2 and it screwed me over not even a month what it. I don't even know what to do.EDIT: Product works. It was just the power brick that came with it. It no longer works. I do have another power brick and the phone does hold a charge.,5
"Although this did not come with original accessories as stated, knock off charger and no headphones which were include in the original accessories of the iphone 4, the phone seems to work fine for my teenager, the exterior is in excellent shape. Will update when I take it to our carrier.",3
Good evening I'm just receiving this iPhone and it's a Verizon iPhone and it's locked.. I need your help to return this item and buy the unlocked cell...,1
When I received this phone I was very impressed by how well the outside of the phone looked. It looked new. Unfortunately when I turned it on there were a few very faint but noticible yellow lines going down the screen. I returned it because I was nervous that this could become a major issue in the future.,2
"I actually am very happy with it, I got it for my little sister, who really wanted it.I was iffy at first but it works well and it looks great. Will be adding pictures later.",5
Phone was in amazing condition!! is unlocked but WILL NOT work with Verizon. It is a GSM phone which means only services like T-Mobile and AT&T will be able to activate it,3
"Genuine new iphone 4s- packaging, charger , earphone not sure but the phone is absolutely new and works great. Great audio clarity, battery performance so far(10-15 days usage only so far). Is unlocked and work like charm with unlocked gsm sim. Great purchase very happy",5
"I bought 2 iphones..one was ok..the other was not unlocked, i sended it to my country and it doesn't work..so now what?i lost my 💰?..because i can't see any option to return the phone",1
"The phone was, contrary to my fears, actually unlocked! I was able to put in my SIM card immediately. The charger, however, was not made by Apple, and the end of the rubber cable was frayed and already disconnected.",4
This is not as advertised. Tried to buy and load a SIM card at a cell phone service provider in Vietnam. Could not get it to work . Do not buy this phone,1
"iPhone arrived within 2 days in Excellent condition. I couldn't find the minor scratches mentioned in the description. Unlocked, as promised. Connected to T-Mobile as soon as I inserted my sim card. Activated phone and synced iTunes. I am very pleased with this purchase!",5
"My first review on Amazon after being a customer for over a decade. This is a total fraud, the charger is cheap off the street, as for apple packaging see the picture of attached box and the plastic sleeve it came in.",1
"It works! It doesn't hold a charge all day but it is ok for now. Not sure I would buy a refurbished again, especially from this seller due to the under charging.",3
"Aside from relatively quickly dying battery, phone is very good. Please be sure to understand your ""carrier/service provider's"" cellular phone requirements before buying this.",4
"It's a good quality phone had a problem updating it, but after that works fine, but someone changed the password to my account so might be something but overall okay buy",3
"Battery life is pretty short... I'd say 3 hours when using the internet the whole time. If I don't use it much it will last through the day. Other than that, it was unlocked and everything seems to work",3
The phone stopped working after less than 30 days. I'm in Argentina and it's impossible to ship items from other countries in here. I guess it's a waste of time and money. Extremely dissapointed of my purchase and don't have any plans to shop again here.,1
"I bought this for my husband because his 5 yr old phone finally gave up the ghost. This works well enough. It is a little slow, but that is probably because it is older and refurbished.",4
Came sooner than expected. First one stopped coming on (wouldn't load) after a year. Liked the phone so much bought another one. This one looks and works fine.,5
We ordered this factory refurbished phone! We missed the return date otherwise we would have returned it! It really never worked properly! We will never buy a refurbished phone again! It is a scam!,1
Not happy at all... I bought this phone that is Supposed to be unlocked But it's not at all. So know I have to figure out how to unlock it since it's my daughter birthday gift that she can't even use now...grrr,1
"So it's been a month since I bought this product for my mom. So far so good, I mean it is an iPhone 4S, you can't really set your expectations too high. Yes, when I received the phone there was a sticker in the back that said that the carrier was Verizon. However, I took it to my Metro store and there was NO PROBLEM connecting it to this carrier.",5
"The Battery goes out in 10 minute with a full charge and the processor doesn't function right, it freezes and stuff. It worked okay for about 1 month.",1
"OK..Did not come with SIM card slot pin.Did not come with ""includes all original accessories"" as stated in the product description.The included charger is cheaply made.Has some scratches.",3
"iPhone looks new ,it works in my countryIt does not comes with complete accessories and original boxCharger adapter US standard not EUROPE, I have to buy Europe standard charger adapter",4
A month after getting this phone the wifi just shut off and can not be turned back on...therefore anything I want to do on this phone has to run off my data plan.. It's terrible and I'm very unsatisfied with this product!!,1
"I bought this iPhone 4S white, certified refurbished by BuySPRY and Fulfilled by Amazon, and a week after I started to use it, the screen became wrong, stripped and then turn black. I am in Argentina, so I don't know what to do, because it doesn't work, but I have no where to claim for a change. I would like an answer for this. Thank you.",1
"Tried to activate with Verizon, they said it could not be activated on their network. I have to conclude it is not an unlocked phone, notwithstanding the product description.",1
"It completely failed. When I inserted the new SIM card, it did not work. I had specifically asked for an unblocked phone that I could use during my trip to Tabzania,and I had to buy a phone there instead. A total waste of money.",1
Phone delivered on time and in excellent condition. I was able to activate it completely on my own and it is working fine. A fifth star would have been merited except somewhat degraded battery performance. Overall I consider it a very good purchase.,4
The phone did not switch on even after charging it for one hour...None of the buttons work....I don't understand how can a seller sell such kind of product....Must be really desperate for bad reviews...,1
I bought 3 iphone 4s 16 gb ... 2 are works great ... but one of them doesnt charge well and the problem is not from the charger ... the problem from the phone entry slot . i deal with amazon and gave me 20 USD as a refund and im happy for it ... now I will fix my phone ... thanks,4
"All things a go! I love it, it's just what I expected. Thanks! I upgraded from iPhone 3 to iPhone 4s. The iPhone 4s is way more advanced then my iPhone 3. I feel like I've moved up in technology phase. Can't wait to advance to the iPhone 5 or even the iPhone 6s.👍🏽📱📲",4
"Fast delivery, though one week of use battery not holding charge and now just completely DIED. Didn't come with all accessories as stated and cheap replacement charger. Returning",2
I bought this for my friend it's very goood and the price very nice to meCome with white box .. charge wall and USBAnd the shipping time 👌🏻 In the timeThank you ❤️,5
Product not working at all 45 days after purchase. This it the third refurbished product I have purchased and the third time I've been burned. No more.,1
"AS my first iPhone this is fantastic. Easy to use, exactly as described. It's smaller than my previous phones which I failed to research properly.HOWEVER I adore it. I would recommend BluTek to anyone. I bought 2 of these phones and they arrived promptly, in fabulous condition and I was very impressed.",5
"The appearance of the phone is excellent , like new. The battery life is good. It had a Verizon related sticker on the back but it is indeed unlocked. It is a GSM phone. I took it to Mexico to use there and got a SIM and number from Telcel without any problems. It works very well.",5
"I set the phone up with AT&T and the first call I made found that I cannot hear the call, the earphone portion is defective, after all that trouble now I have to return the phone for credit.",1
The phone has a small scratch on the screen upon delivery. It isn't terrible and it is a refurbished phone. Worked great out of the box. Satisfied with the purchase overall.,4
"Great condition, great phone. Normal battery. Once I was shocked by the 1 star reviews, finally I divided to give it a shot. I'm sure that I love this one. Only two cons:1, The OS is IOS 9, which is very difficult to be downgraded and kind of slow for iphone 4s. 2, The battery is not so good. I will replace the battery with a bigger capacity one.",5
"Yeah, so don't buy this phone. It's not unlocked. These dudes are either incompetent, scamma-lamma-ding-donging us, or unable to articulate exactly what they think ""unlocked"" means.",1
"This was a gift for my wife and she is happy with it but. Everything works fine except for wi-fi, that is greyed out and not usable. Just google wi-fi issues on iPhone 4s and you will see what I mean. You make your own mind on this one",2
I purchased this phone for my son on July 7 and on August 9 the phone conveniently died. It wouldn't charge at all and sits here as a tribute to my stupidity for listening to my teenage son who told me about purchasing a refurbished phone-- I know betterTHIS IS A SCAM! Do not buy this phone!,1
"There is definitely something wrong with the battery. When you charge it to full battery, in about 1 hour it says low battery. And. I think there is also a problem with the microphone. The most disappointing is that I ordered it as a gift, and it did not work properly.",2
The condition of the phone was near mint but there was something wrong with the battery. I would charge it to full battery and 1 hr later it will say low batt. So basically I need to have a outlet near me at all times..,2
"the iphone does not work, its not been 2 or 3 months I bought it and it does not work at all now.. gets switched off even with full battery, and screen shows loading sign with no other display...",1
"Wish I could leave negative stars, slow shipping despite having prime and phone won't even charge or stay powered on. My poor son was so disappointed. Horrible experience.",1
I took the phone to the Verizon Store in Lexington SC. They told me they could not activate the phone because it is not one of thier's. what do you suggest I do with this phone?,2
"Iphone arrived in perfect condition, looks absolutely brand new. Battery life is great and it seems that the phone has never been used. We activated on Tracfone using their BYOP sim card and had no issues.",5
Its was not unlocked I tried to put cricket wireless for it and it keep telling me the sim was invalid so I called Cricket Wireless and they told me to call Sprint and they told me it was not unlocked,1
"Just received my order for 2 unlocked GSM iPhone 4s & 2 Gorilla glass heavy duty cases. Both phones are Verizon CDMA carrier unlocked which is NOT AT&T or Team Mobile GSM unlocked! Also, 1 of the 2 Gorilla glass case came shattered inside the bubble wrap! Rrrrrrrr😡 Only good thing was package arrived in 24 hours only for me to have to return!",1
I love the phone it works great. But one slight problem. You sent the wrong kind of charger for it. I needed one for an iPhone 4s and you sent Ike for a 5s or newer,5
Never again. Bought this phone went to go activate it to find out I purchased a stolen phone and my carrier wouldn't activate it. I had to bribe the kid $40 to finally activate it. I tried to get a credit . I got nothing but a headache. Very disappointed.,1
"Even though the description says this refurbed phone was unlocked, we wasted an hour in the Verizon store trying to get it activated. What a waste of time.",1
It's was somewhat okay being that it's refurbished. But I had expected be neater than it was.And I didn't expect the accessories to more than a charger. At least an earpiece added would not be bad.,3
"After 5 full discharge and 5 full charge, I get just over 48 hours of stand-by time of battery life. According to the specifications I found on line, the stand-by time should be closer to 200 hours. This is the last time I purchase any refurbished product.",1
The good news is that it was an unlocked phone. And I was able to go to any carrier to start it up.The bad news is that it does not have a good battery life. The phone loses its charge very quickly!,2
"Was a ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" item. I wanted to use it on T-Mobile which is on the GSM network. Phone is described as working on T-Mobile and ATT. It is also described to NOT work on Verizon. The label on the back of the phone indicates it is a Verizon Wireless phone.I'm not taking the chance of having compatibility issue so it will be returned.",1
"The battery cells must be dead or dying because it can't hold a charge for longer than an hour is being used moderately, or even for more than a few hours is left totally alone.",2
We bought this so we could use the TruLink for hearing aids. The iphone will not sync to the Starkey aid as it should. I expected better from Amazon. This lick was why we bought the phone.,1
The product was like brand new and has worked great since I first activated. I am very pleased with the product and it arrived ahead of schedule which makes it even better. Very pleased with my purchase.,5
"The mobile is Ok but in the description said that it is able to work with 4G, that is wrong. I'll kindly suggest to delete this point form the page description",3
"Very disappointed, couldn't be used for Internet at all. Took it to local phone store and they said it was useless. A bad purchase. I won't make that mistake again",1
I am very unhappy with this purchase. I've had to charge this phone at minimum twice a day and if you like to use apps than much more charging would be required.,2
I thought I was going to receive an UNLOCKED cell phone. It appears that it's not because I have been to 2 different phone stores and they can't get it working.,1
My iPhone 4S Unlocked was received on time and was packaged like a brand new phone. It was unlocked as advertised. I was able to activate it with my new SIM chip without any problems. It had to be setup like a new phone. We are very pleased and would recommend this phone.,5
"The phone works ..not sure if its unlocked to work with any carrier , but its unlocked i currently have metro pcs and my sim card did not work in phone..i did not get headphones with the phone but overall the phone is in mint condition",3
Was surprised that the volume on the phone is 1/2 as loud as my original phone purchased new 4 years ago. Bought this one as a gift and the ring is not very loud. Exterior had only a couple of minor scratches which was expected for a refurbished.,3
"Worst!!!Worst!!!Worst...this is not a new phone and it's unlocked AT&T, phone comes with improper packing normal cartron box,After 15 days usage phone charge has defected, now charger is not working, waste of money, do not recommended this seller, since the item is not what they described.",1
The product arrived with no blemishes. I activated it on Tracfone and the sound quality was excellent. I would highly recommend this seller. No complaints with the product.,5
My auxiliary cord and headphones will not plug into my phone. Very bummed out. Can't workout with my phone or listen to good music with it. After a few days the microphone no longer works so people cannot hear me. Avoid this company at all costs.,1
"The phone didn't have any scratches and looked like a brand new. The phone arrived nicely packed in the box with screen protector installed, charging cable, and an apple charger. The phone recognized the SIM card from the foreign provider without any problems.",5
"At the moment I have to say its ok,because I have not used it yet. I will activate it in Germany, and hope all goes well, if it is usable and works well,I will re post my review.M.St.",3
"This phone would not hold a charge. The phone's battery was partially melted and immediately had to buy a new battery. Apparently ""refurbished"" doesn't include a new battery. Very disappointed.",1
Hello! Acquire thisApple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished) product and the same presentaa problem with the handset (not olle ) what is the procedure to enforce the guarantee,3
The battery life is horrible. I changed it fully before leaving home. Within few hours the battery was close to 10 %. It was hardly used for 10 mins of call. This seems to useless. Hope to return the device.,1
"buy two phones refurbished and have received USED micas screen with marks and scratches from use of protective liners or cases , the metal bezel with many brands use too. that just hurts the just received in Venezuela if not immediately returned .",1
The phone itself seemed fine. I wasn't able to tell if it was network-unlocked or not because the phone had an activation lock...definitely not something you expect from a certified refurbished phone.,2
I receive my phone on time and it really awesome!!!! I also like how it work but sometime it take time like 2 minute to wait for loading a program like Facebook and some other app....but I like it anyway,3
"Cosmetically really nice phone... My ringer stopped working, the signal through MetroPCS on the phone sucked. Plus had to buy an extra charger after 2weeks of using it because the charger started falling apart.",1
"OMG what a great buy! This phone is in perfect condition. We were able to set it up without even contacting the carrier, just switched over the sim card. For a teenager wanting an iphone, this was a great investment/starter.",5
Phone is not unlocked as described. It is a Verizon phone. Waited a long time for this phone as I live in Central America and can't return it. What a waste of time and money.,1
"The phone was the correct color and in perfect condition. I had to return it because after taking it to multiple carriers...TMobile, Verizon, and Sprint no one would support it on their network. Evidently unlocked 4s's have this issue.",3
"Many people said ""why are you buying 4s now?"", but I just had this need for an iPhone and purchased this. As the result, I am pretty happy about it. It works fine and the phone is brand new. It's delivered very quickly. 5 stars!",5
"Phone was in good shape and working order. With a bit of help from T-mobile to remove previous user information all was well. However, after about 6 months it is completely unreliable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Battery life is atrocious. Total waste of money.",1
In pristine condition. I went to the Apple Store and they confirmed that it was unblocked. We leave for South Africa and the Maldives for 7 weeks and I will buy a local SIM card. Then I will know for sure if it works.,5
"Well,...my iPhone came like new.....unlocked...on time and i am a happy customer...I would buy again from this company...thank you and good job...P.S...it was fairly priced too...",5
The iphone 4S is good for what it is! Its slow works kinda of shakey meaning I could be trying to do one thing and it will go to a screen that I wasn't trying to get to. Extra hot when talking and definitely holds no charge if I talk on for 20-30 mins.,1
I don't know why everyone is dissing this phone mine came perfect and unlocked. It didn't have a single scratch. The only thing is when you buy older phones like this they're a little slow but besides that perfect.,5
Not the newest phone but we put it in a case for our toddler and load it with kid games so its perfect (not SIM). Note didn't come in the original packing and had a non-OEM charger but all worked as promised.,5
"I am not satisfied. The product fall short of expectation. During telephone conversation the screen is scrambling. Also,sometimes I am unable to answer incoming calls because the ""slide to unlock"" feature is not working.",2
"I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE, THE PHONE MET ALL MY NEEDS. IT WAS DELIVERED QUICKLY AND WORKED AS PROMISED, I'M GOING TO BUY ANOTHER FOR MY WIFE.",5
"Good afternoon amazon, the iphone was received in good physical conditions but with some marks, however the phone is desactivated and the screen indicates to conect it to a pc by using itunes, I tried to activate it through iTunes without success. The iphone is inoperative. Plase i hope you can help me so i can use the article i bought.",1
Product was a gift for someone. Once they received the phone and attempted to use it the return window was over:( we charged the phone for first time use and determined the battery will not hold a charge and drained within a few hours with minimal use.,1
I write pretty good worried because last week received the cell phone to buy him but it does not work because it does not connect to the wireless network as hacerpara that we could change me,1
"Arrived quickly, had to buy it because my phone din't work on the Us networks, now this iPhone works both in the USA and in Holland, so definitely unlocked. Battery was my initial concern with buying a used phone but lasts a whole day with a lot of use and 2-3 days with less use so really happy. Definitely can recommend.",5
The title says it is unlocked. But acctually it is locked to verizon. What happened to Amazon? There are more and more liers now. I am really disappointed.,1
The phone looks great and was well packaged. At first I was concerned that the phone was not fully unlocked because it was a verizon phone but everything works great. I dont know why some customers had issues with this phone being an old verizon phone unless they just never tried putting a sim card in it but im satisfied with everything,5
"After about three weeks of use, I noticed the battery running out very quickly. Now, sometimes it goes from 68% to dead instantaneously, and sometimes it will stay on 1% for hours.I know it was refurbished, but I didn't expect the battery to fail that quickly. I'm disappointed, to say the least, and the phone is no longer eligible for return.",2
Battery dies too prematurely compared to my store-bought iPhone 4 yrs ago. And one of the audio speakers does not work - it arrived this way. Would not buy from this dealer again.,2
"The Betry of this phone is almost dead, I mean it gives maxi 3 hours similarly they said factory unlocked but it is not factory unlock it is At&t phone so I am don't need it I am gona send it back...",1
"I bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it. The phone came in perfect condition. The sim card slot is regular size not micro, which is what I needed. Otherwise I would have had to buy a micro sim kit. Very happy with my purchase.",5
i boutght two of this... one came in OK condition... The other one comes with scratches and with a battery that wont last 1 hour... i am very dissapointed.,1
Never buy this item in TECHarvard. Received 4 used iPhones in absolutely awful condition. Some of them with used batteries and not original low quality parts.,1
"I'm trying to activate the phone and it's asking for a passcode? I bought as a gift for a first time phone for my nephew and apparently wasted my money. It didn't do this the first time I turned it on and now that I want to activate it, I can't do anything.",1
"the phone did not work, I took it to the apple store and it could not be repaired. I ended up trading it in on another 4s that did work .The phone would not pick up my wi fi or any wi fi. It still cost me another $199.00 but it made my little girl happy. It cost me $102.00 for your phone and 199.00 for the new one. No more refurbished for me.",1
It is awesome! I have been wanting an iPhone 4s for a while now and finally got the money to buy it. The phone works 100%. You can add a carrier to it. It works just like any other iPhone too,5
Llego well but with the default screen calls chokes and reheated too when charging the battery would give me warranty then could not make the claim before because just a week ago I get the product because I am from Venezuela and slow as I can solve this problem?,1
The phone works fine with my T-mobile sim card and looks new. However it is quite slow (and I'm not sure if I've just grown used to the speed of the newer versions) and sometimes the screen freezes.,3
"I am very angry.This phone is not Refurbished phone.The iphone's back has many hairline scratchesand Battery life is very short. Is only one-fifth of the normal.Setup iOS version is 9.0, so iphone speed is very slow.OMG purchase.",1
"This product is sold as being unlocked and compatible with T Mobile. After going through the long process of resetting the phone using itunes, it will not work with the T Mobile SIM card. Useless!",1
Received the phone quickly. Everything worked very well except screen has a rattle noise when phone vibrates possibly from loose screen when refurbished. But works perfectly and not a big deal.,4
This phone will not stay connected to Wi-Fi. It is unusable and continually says no service. Very disappointing! We have tried rebooting the phone multiple times to no avail. We kept trying new things to make it work and we are now past the return date. What a waste! So frustrating.,1
"I love this phone. I think that, besides the functionality, I really like how this sturdy this phone is---with just the right amount of weight to it. If something happens to my phone, I will buy this model again.",5
"Got here a day early, however the battery would constantly act up, the phone would shut off and say it was dead, it over heated and lastly--it just stopped sending texts. Returning asap.",1
Won't stay charged and screen had a nice scratch in to plus chips off the bottom of the phone where it's been dropped a few times.. Supposed to be refurbished but all that was done was factory reset...,1
The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it was in good physical condition. The phone would not activate or even recognize a AT&T signal. Not unlocked and not useful. Sent back and gave up after reading endless other negative reviews. These used phone peddlers are definitely the bad apples in Amazons barrel.,2
The phone has issues with the text part it deletes texts after a bit and won't put up notifications when I do get texts its a big pos sorry I bought I don't recommend buying anything from the seller,1
"hi, i would like to contact you about the Apple iPhone 4S. I bought 2 iPhone and one of the two came damaged. The cell phone turns off evens with full battery. Please contact as soon as possible to solve the problem. Thank to you.Apple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked GSM - White (Certified Refurbished)",2
"Yeah, I still own an older iphone 4s, but it's a great deal for a quality product. Unfortunately, the camera cannot be silenced because this is an import model from Japan, but that info was not shared in the description. Also, the volume down button will not function; I have to use the CC menu.",3
Phone died and won't turn on after 92 days (90 day warranty). Very dissapointed! I contacted the seller and hoping they will still honor the warranty although I am 2 days over...I will post and update...,1
Came sooner than expected. First one stopped coming on (wouldn't load) after a year. Liked the phone so much bought another one. This one looks and works fine.,5
We ordered this factory refurbished phone! We missed the return date otherwise we would have returned it! It really never worked properly! We will never buy a refurbished phone again! It is a scam!,1
Its was not unlocked I tried to put cricket wireless for it and it keep telling me the sim was invalid so I called Cricket Wireless and they told me to call Sprint and they told me it was not unlocked,1
Phones appear to be in good condition. Not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap. The USB cable came apart while charging the first time. Reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so I just went to find my own replacement Hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger....,3
"not buying! It does not work: does not play audio from videos or ring when they call, no charge! and I am now in Colombia and I can not return it! And Amazon is not responding!",1
Was surprised that the volume on the phone is 1/2 as loud as my original phone purchased new 4 years ago. Bought this one as a gift and the ring is not very loud. Exterior had only a couple of minor scratches which was expected for a refurbished.,3
Not happy at all... I bought this phone that is Supposed to be unlocked But it's not at all. So know I have to figure out how to unlock it since it's my daughter birthday gift that she can't even use now...grrr,1
"Hello! I am not fully satisfied with this items. one of the phone Home button is difficult to operate. In addition to this any of these phone not complete set.I didn't get earphone(ear plug) for any of them. Do you think , it is acceptable?",3
"OMG what a great buy! This phone is in perfect condition. We were able to set it up without even contacting the carrier, just switched over the sim card. For a teenager wanting an iphone, this was a great investment/starter.",5
Phone is not unlocked as described. It is a Verizon phone. Waited a long time for this phone as I live in Central America and can't return it. What a waste of time and money.,1
"The phone was the correct color and in perfect condition. I had to return it because after taking it to multiple carriers...TMobile, Verizon, and Sprint no one would support it on their network. Evidently unlocked 4s's have this issue.",3
"It came exactly when they said it would and the phone looks brand new. So far, the only problem I've had with it is that it froze on me once, but other than that I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.",4
"I bought this for my husband because his 5 yr old phone finally gave up the ghost. This works well enough. It is a little slow, but that is probably because it is older and refurbished.",4
The iphone 4S is good for what it is! Its slow works kinda of shakey meaning I could be trying to do one thing and it will go to a screen that I wasn't trying to get to. Extra hot when talking and definitely holds no charge if I talk on for 20-30 mins.,1
I don't know why everyone is dissing this phone mine came perfect and unlocked. It didn't have a single scratch. The only thing is when you buy older phones like this they're a little slow but besides that perfect.,5
"Even though the description says this refurbed phone was unlocked, we wasted an hour in the Verizon store trying to get it activated. What a waste of time.",1
"At the moment I have to say its ok,because I have not used it yet. I will activate it in Germany, and hope all goes well, if it is usable and works well,I will re post my review.M.St.",3
"This phone would not hold a charge. The phone's battery was partially melted and immediately had to buy a new battery. Apparently ""refurbished"" doesn't include a new battery. Very disappointed.",1
"The battery cells must be dead or dying because it can't hold a charge for longer than an hour is being used moderately, or even for more than a few hours is left totally alone.",2
Lasted for around 27 days now it won't hold a charge. I loved it when it first game updated it to ios 9.1.2 and it screwed me over not even a month what it. I don't even know what to do.EDIT: Product works. It was just the power brick that came with it. It no longer works. I do have another power brick and the phone does hold a charge.,5
"Although this did not come with original accessories as stated, knock off charger and no headphones which were include in the original accessories of the iphone 4, the phone seems to work fine for my teenager, the exterior is in excellent shape. Will update when I take it to our carrier.",3
Highly satisfied for the quality of the product. It forks perfectly and I can frankly recommend to people who are willing to buy cell phone not to go any place else,4
"The volume on the phone is turned completely up and it is still difficult to hear at times. I thought I was getting the iphone 5, but that was my fault.",3
"The iPhone is good as was written. It is unlocked, new and with all equipment. I'm happy with it and I'm going to buy other things from thas seller for sure. Thanks",5
The phone had some clear marks of wearing on the front and back of the phone even thought it was marked as used like new. It also was missing the wall plug when it stated that it had all the accesories.,3
"The phone is good just that when i received it, the flashlight wasn't working but i got a partial refund back. Other than that he phone is hundred percent good.",4
Perfect!!!!! Thank you for the fast delivery. Beautiful condition. I lost my iPhone and bought this one. Felt weird about buying it online but it exceeded expectations. Thanks!,5
Excellent product that does not need much descriptions. Properly unlocked. Works excellent with Colombian Phone service providers. Apple is the best choice in smartphones for me.,5
For the first month it operated like new and then the product became defective. I sent it to apple to get it fixed and They could not do anything for it. It is a complete and utter waste of my $399. I am highly upset but there is nothing i can do about it.,1
"Late response: this seller offered me a fantastic deal on a great device. The benefit to my review is 2 years later and its still an awesome value. I'm using it to write the review- the device arrived as said, in better condition then was listed (great-listed as good) and everything works as well as lasted. Throughly satisfied. Thank you!",5
"The phone i bought and receive was stolen. When i was going to activate the phone, the phone was reported stolen therefore i couldn't activate the phone",1
"Overall pretty good.The iphone 4s looks very new, but the battery is not durable and Packaging unsealed.The factory date is October 2011.My iPhone headset can not answer or hang up a call, only to play or pause music. It has no volume control. I think it's not an iphone headset, but an ipod headphones.",5
In the description it stated that it was like new almost flawless and that it didnt have any problems. When i got it and went to activate it with AT&T they said it had water damage.,1
"I was very well satisfied by this product. Not only did it arrive days before it was expected, but it came with THIRTEEN different screen protectors. The iphone was only very minimally scratched, little enough to be mistaken for new. I was very impressed",5
THE SELLER AND I ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS PHONE. THE PHONE'S BATTERY WON'T HOLD A CHARGE TO BE A BRAND NEW PHONE. THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING TO WORK WITH ME TO GET IT FIXED. WE BELIEVE IT'S A DEFECTIVE BATTERY FROM APPLE.,3
"When I bought this phone i noticed how the phone didnt quite match the description. When i got the phone and went to get it activated it came up stolen. I am extremely disappointed because the phone looked super clean with no scatches, basically it was new.",1
What I was looking for was a phone with a few scratches and/or scuffs... What I received was a brand new iphone 4s no scratches no scuffs everything in working order...Thank you!!!!!,5
Arrived with more wear and tear than described. Definitely had been used and not protected well. Power button working after repeated attempts. Volume button sticks.,2
"according to the model number, I recieved and Iphone 4 and not 4s. The model number is A1332, not A1387 as specified. I am not satisfied with this purchase.",2
"I've had this phone for about a year and a half at this point, and there are no problems with the phone itself. Obviously older generations of the iPhone run a little slower with the new OS, but that is certainly not the seller's fault. I'll probably keep this phone for at least another 6 months.",5
Got it for the memory. intended to use as a i pod replacement for auto sound system. couldn't get it to cooperate the playback of music was not good quality either,2
Awesome. I've never bought a phone on Amazon and I was very skeptical. I broke my phone and needed a back up phone until I was eligible for an upgrade. I received the phone and it was just as the description said. I would definitely recommend this seller. Fast shipment too!!!,5
very nice iphone .very good quality as write in description ..came early then expected..very good coustmer services .i suggest this dealer(greensqd) to everyone ..nice job . thank you very much .,5
"something was clearly wrong with the phone, it would not hold a charge. after buying a new battery and installing the next day the phone the screen went blank and has not worked since. I have since had to purchase another phone. Not Happy!",1
Works great. Only reason I bought it was I love the iPhone 4s and my first one just didn't have enough memory for all of my music so I bought this one with double the GB of memory. Still use my old one for music when I just want to listen to music and am using my other one in rooms on bluetooth when I want this one nearby and handy to answer.,5
You gave me the wrong goods.You give me an iphone4 no the iphone4s that i need .And all mobile phone accessories not genuine.I also found that Mobile Charger is bad.,1
"I bought iphone 4s like new at&t for $370, but when I got the item it's only iphone 4 and there's lots of scracth in the back and side metal.It's not worth for the price.",1
I bought this for my daughter and she is very pleased with it and all the different things it does. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Would do business with these people again.,5
Ordered it Monday its now Wednesday and i received my phone fast. It looks and feel great the description was not a lie it was brand new not even opened came in the original box :) definitely impress with this seller will definitely order in the future :),5
Phone came quickly and I was able to transfer all my content and service over to it without a problem. This was an upgrade for me from a 3g and the difference is fantastic.,5
"everything said about the phone was right, but the battery is damage and need replace, base on the diagnostic made to the phone by Apple store I went to..",3
"I rejected getting an iPhone for years, and if you're reading this, you probably have too. I had 3 Blackberries over the course of 4 years, and all of the minor flaws I found with those phones are non-existent with this phone.Really, it hasn't changed my life or anything, but I do wish I'd done this sooner. Especially for the camera.",5
"I've been impressed with processing speed, quality build and ease of use. Screen is small by today's standards but very clear. Touch screen is very precise. Runs OS 8 without problems.",5
This phone was exactly what I wanted and it worked well. I dropped it and shattered the face shortly after owning it but was able to pick up an IPhone 5.,5
"Absolute amazing transaction, got the phone with not a single scratch on it, in fact it looked brand new to me. Thanks for the phone and thanks so much for the smooth transaction.",5

Gross!!",1
"The phone works great! However, I had trouble getting service accepted on Tracfone because of the IMEI. Finally I talked with someone who accepted the receipt from the vendor working through Amazon.com and got the service. I have no idea why it was questioned. The phone works exactly as expected and everything was precisely as described.",4
"Worked well, but battery life is very low. Would hope refurbishing would include replacing the battery. I am considering having a new battery installed.",3
"very disappointed in Apple products....had nothing but issues with it out of the box, none of which were the seller's fault...it was just an outdated product that needed multiple updates, and the updates rendered it unusable...will never make that mistake again and will stick with what I know, with Android products",1
Worst thing I ever did was to buy this phone can't pull up videos or any kind of we site on Facebook everyone complains about the coming and going of me talking people hear their echo waste of money will never buy a phone from the Amazon site 235.00 down the drain,1

"The item came in a small white box with the charger and nothing else, it was boxed well, the item was used and had a small chip in the lower left corner glass but nothing to be upset about, the home buttons works fine and battery life is still very good",4
"SCAM ALERT!!! NOT A NEW PHONE!!! This was originally a BLACK phone. They repaired it and are selling it as new!! Ear piece does not even work! Can only use speaker phone!! BUYER BE WARE!! AND, The restrictions are set so the phone CANNOT be wiped/reset without the pass code!",1
"Works like a charm. I appreciate the increased space. It does get hot. I did have to replace the screen since the phone ""jumped off my desk "" j/k. I have not figured out how not to wear down my battery so I just carry an extra dual powered battery with me.",4
"Tried to rate this yesterday with no star, not sure if it worked. I was sold what was advertised as a Verizon network phone, paid for it (250 ish) waited more than a month for it, it is an apple 4s, it is not a Verizon network phone, and Verizon cannot activate it. The transaction was a fraud and I was left with a useless, paid for phone.",1
"Disregard 1st review..The company I bought the phone from, Tonkin, call me back about the phone issue and resolved it.. It wasn't their phone..it was Verizon.. Phone works great and thumbs up with the seller...Thank you..",5
I only give 4 stars because the first phone sent didn't work but they were very helpful and kind about getting it replaced and the new phone works great!,4

AVOID THIS SELLER",1
"Once the phone gets to 30% or less of battery, it just shuts off randomly. Sometimes I can get it back on, but usually it's just gone until it's charged again. Use a different seller.",2
"It looksbrand new, and works perfectly. I live in a very rural area and my Galaxy SII got poor reception, but this iPhone is great. People can hear me just fine, and I do not experience dropped calls. I highly recommend it.",5
"Amazon allowed an individual to list their gently used model. It was so well timed, and exactly what I needed at the time. Fortuitous and smart placement for the right reasons.Bravo to internet and the principle used.",4
"Okay phone. Ios8 eats up phone battery, but upgrade fix came on it to help with this issue. Did not come with charger but no notice that it would lack charger.",3
"The phone came just in time, as my husband's old phone had been dying, and it finally gave up the ghost the day the iphone 4s arrived. So, thank you for timely delivery and a great product as advertized.",5
"Although my shipping address had problems, seller made sure to re-ship to an alternate address at no extra cost. The product was exactly as I'd expected. Thank you!",5
"Unfortunately, this was not a good purchase....I've only h ad trouble with this phone. It continuously says 'Roaming', phone calls and text won't go through, and it's just got other faulty features. Also, I'm not one to complain, but this was not a good purchase. Especially the amount I paid for this.",1
"I ordered this phone as a ""new"" phone. After only 3 months the screen went dead, so I brought the phone in to the Apple store . They opened the phone and told me that the hardware inside was not apple hardware.PLEASE be aware, this is not what it is advertised as!!!",1
My iphone 4s screen scrambles / gets garbled almost EVERY time I make a phone call longer than a couple minutes. Not exactly worth what I paid for it.,2
The phone will shut off when it's still at 80+ percent battery life and not turn back on until I hook up the charger. Also neither charging cable worked that came with the phones.,2
"Fake. The serial # didn't exist according to Apple, the bezel was damaged, the front and rear face felt like plastic and not glass. Do yourself a favour and just buy a new one from BestBuy.",1
I am so happy with this phone. I accidentally washed his phone in the washer and didn't think I could replace it for a reasonable price. This phone is perfect with a clean body and screen with no scratches or blemishes. I would love to buy from this seller again.,5
After having this item for only 2.5 mos. The OS is crashing and I reset the iphone every 10 minutes. I have restore this iphone 3 times and lost my pictures. It works sometimes. You get what you pay for.,1
Ordered as a replacement for a 16GB 4S that was nearing the end of it's service life. It is functionally identical to my previous phone and I am happy with it.,5
I am very pleased with this phone. It was shipped nicely and quickly. It has given me zero problems and was as described with some slight scratches on front and back glass. Thank you!,5

"The price was right, the packaging was amazing (literally 4 packages inside each other for protection) and the phone works perfectly. Could not have asked for anything better!",5
"Works perfect, wife destroyed her first iPhone and we did not have insurance on it. So bought a used iPhone and it is working great and this time I got insurance for this one.",5
I was a little hesitant to order a refurbished phone. But the price was just too good for me to pass up. I have not found any problems with this phone and I am on it ALOT!!!! It arrived on time and looks brand new. It only came with a getting started book and a charger cord.,5
"After using a Samsung Android smartphone for the past two years, it took a little getting use to the iPhone.Most of the apps I used before come in either the same or nearly the same format for the iPhone. Camera and video are way better than my old Samsung.",4
"I've been exposed to the process of monument, I've bought this phone to be open to my network, and it turns out he closed, I wish I could bring him back and retrieve financial",1
I originally had a 16 GB that quickly ran out of memory because of my favorite songs I have stored. I have to say I absolutely love the 32 GB I have plenty a room left I can save tons of pictures and music. Overall became is expected was in perfect condition and I am actually writing this review with it.,5
"Worst fear realized. You buy an expensive used phone online and it doesn't work. After spending an entire day on the phone with Verizon and apple, the issue was found to be from faulty hardware. Don't fall for the same trap I did.",1
"I bought my first iPhone off of Amazon back in January and I still have it- NO problems with it- Good as brand new! I traded it out for my old phone on my Verizon plan way before my 2-year-upgrade was due (because really, who can wait that long?!). Worked like a charm. Highly recommend.",5
This phone was in great condition. I bought this phone for a friend and it came with all of its original packaging and accessories. I'd buy from this person again.,5
This is a very good item! We ordered it used looked brand new! But they got our order wrong the first time that's the only thing wrong but other than that great!,4
This phone was listed as a 4s. It is only a 4. Got totally swindled as the only reason I would of paid that kind of money was fr a 4s. Not happy at all Bought as a Christmas present for my daughter away at college.,1
Received my phone that I was in desperate need of today. I order it less than three days ago and it already made it here. I am very happy with it so far. Thanks!,4
"The phone has some kinks but overall it works fine, I kept it & will make the best of it. I hate sounding so uninspired, but my experience was somewhat disappointing.",1
Got this for my BFF because I lost hers at cedar point. The battery says 45% and then you can watch it you don't even have to touch the phone it will drop to 1% and die. It's a piece of crap and it freezes all the time don't waste your money,1
The phone works well but I found that there is a spot on the screen where someone put too much pressure and it is permanently a blue color rather than white. The only other issue I have is the volume changing and some of the speaker areas are very dirty but I feel like that is expected for a used phone. All in all I love my iPhone.,4
Got this iPhone use threw amazons warehouse deals and there wasn't a scratch or finger print on it! Looked and operates brand new. Got $60 a month Verizon prepaid service on it which is unlimited talk and text with 2 gigs of data!! This was a awesome choice cause I have no contract and can cancel any time thanks amazon,5
I was very satisfied with the iPhone 4S! The phone was in excellent condition and described correctly. I would definitely purchase an item again withou any hesitation. Thank you for your honesty and great reputation on satisfied reviews.,5
"Awesome phone! Even better than expected. Very sleak, clean and it had a great screen. Huge upgrade from my previous flip phone. Still learning how to use the phone but already downloaded approximately 15 apps and all downloaded extremely fast and had no issues. This phone is a great tool for your life!",5
"I bought this phone for my wife as an upgrade, and the phone looked immaculate, but it only worked for a couple of months because the volume stopped working. Luckily I called Verizon and due to the fact that the no longer had any replacement iPhone 4S phone I was sent an iPhone 5 instead so in the end it was all worth it.",3
iPhone 4s. Came charged. Had to update. Having phone for two months now it has some issues. It dies at 30% battery and crashes randomly. Would not recommend to a friend.,3
"The phone works great! However, I had trouble getting service accepted on Tracfone because of the IMEI. Finally I talked with someone who accepted the receipt from the vendor working through Amazon.com and got the service. I have no idea why it was questioned.

It's the best Segway into a newer iPhone model. It came faster than expected in great like new condition. Amazon warehouse deals Arran excellent source for discounted products!,5
"After having the phone for several months it has multiple little issues. Drops wifi, the screen flashes when trying to take a photo, apps just turn off at random, screen shot will shut down the phone, drops calls etc.",2
I just received my phone and it is the wrong carrier. The outside of the box says Verizon but went to activate it and it is a Sprint phone. Seriously annoying. I would have given zero stars but it wouldn't let me.,1
"The performance of iPhone's are legendary. That is why it is THE benchmark these days in mobile communication devices. My daughter just loves her new phone.The battery life is really good, but I highly recommend the Boostcase products. They almost almost 18 hours of usable battery life - and that's with a teenager hamering away on it.",5
"You're still new to it? I held off from a smart phone for a while to keep from becoming ""Internet dependent."" This was my first smartphone and I'm very happy with it. Be careful though, once you get this, you might really get into it and want the latest and greatest (iPhone 5; thinner, faster, lighter)",5
I recovered the product faster than expected and in excellent condition. It didn't come with the proper iPhone box but did have headphones and a charger.,5
Worst thing I ever did was to buy this phone can't pull up videos or any kind of we site on Facebook everyone complains about the coming and going of me talking people hear their echo waste of money will never buy a phone from the Amazon site 235.00 down the drain,1

"Apple iPhone 4S 32GB (White) - AT&T -Like new.When I got the phone first time, I found the accessory headphone wire was bent, but test the function OK. I have used it for 2 months, the IOS 7 system is very reliable.No big scratch was found on the Cell phone.",4
"Love the phone, hate the company. Apple is a bloodsucking company and its sad. Stop making so many phones and just put great technology in 1 phone that won't be outdated in 6 months. Ffs",5
too good this article made me missing because I needed a computer with these features to further work that is fun and practical recommend it for all people,5
iPhone 4s works perfectly I'm also glad it runs iOS eight with voice activation.I have had it for three days now and had no problems everything runs smooth especially the games.,5
"I received a 16 GB White iphone 4s instead of 32 GB.And what item I received is,there is no modem firmware and it doesn't detect a wifi and also the battery is no good doesn't charge anymore.It means that I did not received the right item that I expect.",2
We bought what we thought was a brand new I-phone...new in box is what our receipt said and we just found out from Apple it was 2 years old when it was shipped to us in a new and new wrapped Apple box.,1
"The iPhone is simple to use and works great. Plus this model doesn't have the lightning adapter which seems to be more trouble than it's worth (cables cost twice as much, video and audio out are limited compared to the 30 pin, and aftermarket products can be difficult to come by).",5
"This phone was in absolutely perfect condition, all of the additional accessories were included in pristine condition as well. Highly reccomend this product to everyone, couldnt be more satisfied.",5
"The cell phone is a white iphone 4s,but amazon gives me a black earphone.Furthermore I cann't activate the cell phone with SIM card of other carrier.But Sheetal(a staff of service department) help me to solve the problem.He is a good man.",5

4s is a great phone but slower than a 5 and much slower still than a 5s. It still fully updates with the 5s.. unlike a regular 4. I haven't really had any issues with it but faster is always better.,5
This is legit!!! I placed my order 1/27/16 and I got it 1/30/1! It came faster than I had expected. Today is the first day but so far I love it. I can't afford the other phone prices so this works for me. The fact that it comes with all of the accessories tells me I got a good phone. I will definitely let other people. Thanks so much!,5
"Great phone, the only reason I am not completely satisfied with this, is because it has a bit of a charging problem when plugged into a computer. Other than that everything works great and I love it.",5
"USPS lost my package and put me through a nightmare, but Oakland Wireless replaced the product at no cost and got my new phone to me within just a couple of days!

"A used phone with a poor battery and no accessories earns it 2 stars.Otherwise, an iPhone 4S is an iPhone 4S so its a great build and a very great OS in it.One nice feature is the ability to have reminders go off based on a geographic location; its great on that.",2
"I was skeptical at first on buying an iPhone since I was an Android fan.I love my iPhone, it came in perfect condition, & brand NEW!Also, it came to my house in exactly 4 days, just like they said it would!I am now an iPhone lover!",5
"I love Apple products, LOVE the iPhone.... But hate when online sellers choose to lie and be dishonest about lies after the costumer has already received the product. It is NOT fair when someone is receiving $400 easily by selling a USED phone.",1
Excellent product! It was more than I expected. Works perfectly and smoothly. It also arrived earlier than expected. I really like it. It's awesome :),5
Well what can I say except the iPhone is the top of the line cell phone for me!!! I have had an iPhone since the first day it launched. Great phone and easy to use. My husband was anti-apple but has since changed his tune since receiving his iPhone 4s - let's just say he will not be turning back now!,5

If you are the type of person that always wants to have the newest gadget: stop reading here.For all the others that want to have a great phone at a great price: the iPhone 4S is your first choice. It offers a lot more than the 4 and not a lot less than the 5. Believe me: this is a great deal.,5
When I first ordered the iPhone 4S it arrived while I was travelling and I could not set it up for almost 20 days. When I finally got to play with it the phone died after about 24 hours. Looked to me like it was the battery. I sent it back and received new one right away. This one works like a charm.,5
Zachary was great the whole time and helped me return his product to him without any hassle. He honestly made the experience great. Based on the emails we exchanged he seems like an honest person and replies promptly.,5
"The item description said Like New, but I received a cellphone with multiple scratcheson the back and on the screen. It seems like this iphone never wore a case. There's alsoa delay when you adjust settings. I didn't return it because I was about to travel abroad.Even though it is a 32gb, I paid too much for what I got.",2
"The product came with no problems, damage (other than a few scratches from regular use because I bought a used one) I bought this to replace my ipod touch 4th gen that served me well since January of 2010. So far this iphone has served me well as a replacement ipod. I love it!",5
"the phone worked only one month and the problem is that it was at a premium of Venezuela a gift, it was a total fiasco and i do not know if it is warranted because the period amazon and return step, a waste of money",1

And I got the phone before the estimated delivery day very pleased with my new iPhone",5
the iphone I am sure is great but I have used an android phone for years so for me the iphone was alittle crazy. But after reading the book for dummies for the iphone 4s it was easier. I am not very tech savy. so for anyone else I think the phone would be great.,4
"Big cheater. Item described as new sealed in box , iPhone 4s . Received the item. It's used even the box not the original and those accessories are old.",1
Im not exactly happy with this purchase as II believe that i received a dead battery. All I have ever been able to do with the phone is forward it to another number .,2
"I just received the iPhone 4s i bought and it is in great shape, just as i read in the product details or even better, it really is like new. It came with a gray case also just like the seller said. He said he would throw in a bumper also which wasn't sent, but overall great product, trustful seller. thank you very much.",5

"Shipping was a bit slow but overall the product is excellent! Glad that I didn't believe what others were saying about this phone (buggy and such). If you own an iphone 4, and what to switch, go ahead because this is totally worth the dough!",4
"Great phone... I have had many cell phones but because my apt has many dead zones no other phone has worked as well as this 32GB iPhone 4. With this phone, I can go almost anywhere with the phone and I have rarely any dropped calls... Its great not to have to sit in one place in my house to talk on the cell...",5
It don't work for T-Mobile i went to the store and they said it was with Verizon and sprint so if you have those your good but when I got the phone is was in great condition,1

The product arrived with no blemishes. I activated it on Tracfone and the sound quality was excellent. I would highly recommend this seller. No complaints with the product.,5
My auxiliary cord and headphones will not plug into my phone. Very bummed out. Can't workout with my phone or listen to good music with it. After a few days the microphone no longer works so people cannot hear me. Avoid this company at all costs.,1
"The phone didn't have any scratches and looked like a brand new. The phone arrived nicely packed in the box with screen protector installed, charging cable, and an apple charger. The phone recognized the SIM card from the foreign provider without any problems.",5
Well this phone is breaking everyday like charger just broke left speaker don't work and when u talk on the phone I have to put it on speaker to hear something,2
Hello! Acquire thisApple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished) product and the same presentaa problem with the handset (not olle ) what is the procedure to enforce the guarantee,3
The battery life is horrible. I changed it fully before leaving home. Within few hours the battery was close to 10 %. It was hardly used for 10 mins of call. This seems to useless. Hope to return the device.,1
"At the moment I have to say its ok,because I have not used it yet. I will activate it in Germany, and hope all goes well, if it is usable and works well,I will re post my review.M.St.",3
"This phone would not hold a charge. The phone's battery was partially melted and immediately had to buy a new battery. Apparently ""refurbished"" doesn't include a new battery. Very disappointed.",1
"I bought this for my husband because his 5 yr old phone finally gave up the ghost. This works well enough. It is a little slow, but that is probably because it is older and refurbished.",4
"The battery cells must be dead or dying because it can't hold a charge for longer than an hour is being used moderately, or even for more than a few hours is left totally alone.",2
Not the newest phone but we put it in a case for our toddler and load it with kid games so its perfect (not SIM). Note didn't come in the original packing and had a non-OEM charger but all worked as promised.,5
"I am not satisfied. The product fall short of expectation. During telephone conversation the screen is scrambling. Also,sometimes I am unable to answer incoming calls because the ""slide to unlock"" feature is not working.",2
Received the phone quickly. Everything worked very well except screen has a rattle noise when phone vibrates possibly from loose screen when refurbished. But works perfectly and not a big deal.,4
This phone will not stay connected to Wi-Fi. It is unusable and continually says no service. Very disappointing! We have tried rebooting the phone multiple times to no avail. We kept trying new things to make it work and we are now past the return date. What a waste! So frustrating.,1
The phone stopped working after less than 30 days. I'm in Argentina and it's impossible to ship items from other countries in here. I guess it's a waste of time and money. Extremely dissapointed of my purchase and don't have any plans to shop again here.,1
"buy two phones refurbished and have received USED micas screen with marks and scratches from use of protective liners or cases , the metal bezel with many brands use too. that just hurts the just received in Venezuela if not immediately returned .",1
"So it's been a month since I bought this product for my mom. So far so good, I mean it is an iPhone 4S, you can't really set your expectations too high. Yes, when I received the phone there was a sticker in the back that said that the carrier was Verizon. However, I took it to my Metro store and there was NO PROBLEM connecting it to this carrier.",5
The phone has a small scratch on the screen upon delivery. It isn't terrible and it is a refurbished phone. Worked great out of the box. Satisfied with the purchase overall.,4
"Great condition, great phone. Normal battery. Once I was shocked by the 1 star reviews, finally I divided to give it a shot. I'm sure that I love this one. Only two cons:1, The OS is IOS 9, which is very difficult to be downgraded and kind of slow for iphone 4s. 2, The battery is not so good. I will replace the battery with a bigger capacity one.",5
"Was a ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" item. I wanted to use it on T-Mobile which is on the GSM network. Phone is described as working on T-Mobile and ATT. It is also described to NOT work on Verizon. The label on the back of the phone indicates it is a Verizon Wireless phone.I'm not taking the chance of having compatibility issue so it will be returned.",1
I bought 3 iphone 4s 16 gb ... 2 are works great ... but one of them doesnt charge well and the problem is not from the charger ... the problem from the phone entry slot . i deal with amazon and gave me 20 USD as a refund and im happy for it ... now I will fix my phone ... thanks,4
"After about three weeks of use, I noticed the battery running out very quickly. Now, sometimes it goes from 68% to dead instantaneously, and sometimes it will stay on 1% for hours.I know it was refurbished, but I didn't expect the battery to fail that quickly. I'm disappointed, to say the least, and the phone is no longer eligible for return.",2
"I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE, THE PHONE MET ALL MY NEEDS. IT WAS DELIVERED QUICKLY AND WORKED AS PROMISED, I'M GOING TO BUY ANOTHER FOR MY WIFE.",5
"Good afternoon amazon, the iphone was received in good physical conditions but with some marks, however the phone is desactivated and the screen indicates to conect it to a pc by using itunes, I tried to activate it through iTunes without success. The iphone is inoperative. Plase i hope you can help me so i can use the article i bought.",1
I purchased this phone for my son on July 7 and on August 9 the phone conveniently died. It wouldn't charge at all and sits here as a tribute to my stupidity for listening to my teenage son who told me about purchasing a refurbished phone-- I know betterTHIS IS A SCAM! Do not buy this phone!,1
Lasted for around 27 days now it won't hold a charge. I loved it when it first game updated it to ios 9.1.2 and it screwed me over not even a month what it. I don't even know what to do.EDIT: Product works. It was just the power brick that came with it. It no longer works. I do have another power brick and the phone does hold a charge.,5
"Although this did not come with original accessories as stated, knock off charger and no headphones which were include in the original accessories of the iphone 4, the phone seems to work fine for my teenager, the exterior is in excellent shape. Will update when I take it to our carrier.",3
We bought this so we could use the TruLink for hearing aids. The iphone will not sync to the Starkey aid as it should. I expected better from Amazon. This lick was why we bought the phone.,1
The product was like brand new and has worked great since I first activated. I am very pleased with the product and it arrived ahead of schedule which makes it even better. Very pleased with my purchase.,5
A month after getting this phone the wifi just shut off and can not be turned back on...therefore anything I want to do on this phone has to run off my data plan.. It's terrible and I'm very unsatisfied with this product!!,1
"I bought this iPhone 4S white, certified refurbished by BuySPRY and Fulfilled by Amazon, and a week after I started to use it, the screen became wrong, stripped and then turn black. I am in Argentina, so I don't know what to do, because it doesn't work, but I have no where to claim for a change. I would like an answer for this. Thank you.",1
"Tried to activate with Verizon, they said it could not be activated on their network. I have to conclude it is not an unlocked phone, notwithstanding the product description.",1
"It completely failed. When I inserted the new SIM card, it did not work. I had specifically asked for an unblocked phone that I could use during my trip to Tabzania,and I had to buy a phone there instead. A total waste of money.",1
Phone delivered on time and in excellent condition. I was able to activate it completely on my own and it is working fine. A fifth star would have been merited except somewhat degraded battery performance. Overall I consider it a very good purchase.,4
"Wish I could leave negative stars, slow shipping despite having prime and phone won't even charge or stay powered on. My poor son was so disappointed. Horrible experience.",1
"There is definitely something wrong with the battery. When you charge it to full battery, in about 1 hour it says low battery. And. I think there is also a problem with the microphone. The most disappointing is that I ordered it as a gift, and it did not work properly.",2
The condition of the phone was near mint but there was something wrong with the battery. I would charge it to full battery and 1 hr later it will say low batt. So basically I need to have a outlet near me at all times..,2
"the iphone does not work, its not been 2 or 3 months I bought it and it does not work at all now.. gets switched off even with full battery, and screen shows loading sign with no other display...",1
"It works! It doesn't hold a charge all day but it is ok for now. Not sure I would buy a refurbished again, especially from this seller due to the under charging.",3
"Aside from relatively quickly dying battery, phone is very good. Please be sure to understand your ""carrier/service provider's"" cellular phone requirements before buying this.",4
"It's a good quality phone had a problem updating it, but after that works fine, but someone changed the password to my account so might be something but overall okay buy",3
"This product is sold as being unlocked and compatible with T Mobile. After going through the long process of resetting the phone using itunes, it will not work with the T Mobile SIM card. Useless!",1
The phone looks brand new! There are no scratches anywhere. The charger was even wrapped as the new ones! I've tried it with my at&t unlocked sim card and with an international sim card and it works perfectly so far.,5
It's was somewhat okay being that it's refurbished. But I had expected be neater than it was.And I didn't expect the accessories to more than a charger. At least an earpiece added would not be bad.,3
"After 5 full discharge and 5 full charge, I get just over 48 hours of stand-by time of battery life. According to the specifications I found on line, the stand-by time should be closer to 200 hours. This is the last time I purchase any refurbished product.",1
The good news is that it was an unlocked phone. And I was able to go to any carrier to start it up.The bad news is that it does not have a good battery life. The phone loses its charge very quickly!,2
The phone did not switch on even after charging it for one hour...None of the buttons work....I don't understand how can a seller sell such kind of product....Must be really desperate for bad reviews...,1
"Worst!!!Worst!!!Worst...this is not a new phone and it's unlocked AT&T, phone comes with improper packing normal cartron box,After 15 days usage phone charge has defected, now charger is not working, waste of money, do not recommended this seller, since the item is not what they described.",1
I bought this for my friend it's very goood and the price very nice to meCome with white box .. charge wall and USBAnd the shipping time 👌🏻 In the timeThank you ❤️,5
Product not working at all 45 days after purchase. This it the third refurbished product I have purchased and the third time I've been burned. No more.,1
"The iPhone itself appeared to be near new. However, the sim tool and ear buds were missing, even though the copy clear states that all original accessories were included. Vendor will not provide.",2
"All things a go! I love it, it's just what I expected. Thanks! I upgraded from iPhone 3 to iPhone 4s. The iPhone 4s is way more advanced then my iPhone 3. I feel like I've moved up in technology phase. Can't wait to advance to the iPhone 5 or even the iPhone 6s.👍🏽📱📲",4
"Fast delivery, though one week of use battery not holding charge and now just completely DIED. Didn't come with all accessories as stated and cheap replacement charger. Returning",2
"AS my first iPhone this is fantastic. Easy to use, exactly as described. It's smaller than my previous phones which I failed to research properly.HOWEVER I adore it. I would recommend BluTek to anyone. I bought 2 of these phones and they arrived promptly, in fabulous condition and I was very impressed.",5
"Phone works ok but, i received a broken charger? it was completely disconnected from the piece and my home button kinda sticks but other then that it is ok find out tomorrow if cricket accepts it.",3
To my relief my phone worked fine. Ironically I could not activate on Verizon as a prepaid phone but it worked fine with Tracfone. I do not have any battery issues. This is just a backup phone anyway. It is not being used as a primary phone. I use it while I travel so I don't risk losing the more expensive version of this phone,5
Phone died and won't turn on after 92 days (90 day warranty). Very dissapointed! I contacted the seller and hoping they will still honor the warranty although I am 2 days over...I will post and update...,1
The phone itself seemed fine. I wasn't able to tell if it was network-unlocked or not because the phone had an activation lock...definitely not something you expect from a certified refurbished phone.,2
"The mobile is Ok but in the description said that it is able to work with 4G, that is wrong. I'll kindly suggest to delete this point form the page description",3
"I set the phone up with AT&T and the first call I made found that I cannot hear the call, the earphone portion is defective, after all that trouble now I have to return the phone for credit.",1
"In the publication you say the cellphone have all the originals accessories, you only send me the cellphone with a not original charger, you don't send me headphones. I need comunicate with the you.",2
"This phone worked great....until I went to purchase service from a no contract company, and they informed me that this phone was not on their list of unlocked phones. It's stuck on a Verizon Pre-Paid plan. My advice, keep looking.",1
"Very disappointed, couldn't be used for Internet at all. Took it to local phone store and they said it was useless. A bad purchase. I won't make that mistake again",1
"Hello! I am not fully satisfied with this items. one of the phone Home button is difficult to operate. In addition to this any of these phone not complete set.I didn't get earphone(ear plug) for any of them. Do you think , it is acceptable?",3
"Phone came in awesome condition with no scratches or dents in it. Battery life was amazing as well! I highly recommend you get this phone! This phone comes already with ios 9. Includes with- Refurbished Unlocked iPhone 4S with built in iCloud, Charging cable with plugThis was a good deal and no other price can beat this!",5
DO NOT BUY THIS IPHONE !I've had it for two weeks and is a piece of junk:-The audio does not work most of the time (especially when using headphones).-It does not connect to Wi-Fi at times.-Safari app crashes constantly.-Battery runs out quickly once it reaches 50 %. Do not buy it. Be smart and buy a new one. I am returning this piece of junk.,1
"Was supposed to be gsm unlocked phone, turns out it was for sprint. So it doesn't work for what i need, eventhough it stated it was for those networks in the description!!!!",1
The iphone 4S is good for what it is! Its slow works kinda of shakey meaning I could be trying to do one thing and it will go to a screen that I wasn't trying to get to. Extra hot when talking and definitely holds no charge if I talk on for 20-30 mins.,1
I don't know why everyone is dissing this phone mine came perfect and unlocked. It didn't have a single scratch. The only thing is when you buy older phones like this they're a little slow but besides that perfect.,5
I receive my phone on time and it really awesome!!!! I also like how it work but sometime it take time like 2 minute to wait for loading a program like Facebook and some other app....but I like it anyway,3
"Cosmetically really nice phone... My ringer stopped working, the signal through MetroPCS on the phone sucked. Plus had to buy an extra charger after 2weeks of using it because the charger started falling apart.",1
"Perfect. iPhone was unlocked, I took it in to AT&T, new sim card, 5 mins later everything was working 100%YES this was a verizon iphone! Verizon had apple unlock them, 4 & 4S in 2014. Just slip in a micro sim card, I tried my T-moble and moms Att... BOTH worked just fine.Very Happy",5
The phone works fine with my T-mobile sim card and looks new. However it is quite slow (and I'm not sure if I've just grown used to the speed of the newer versions) and sometimes the screen freezes.,3
"I am very angry.This phone is not Refurbished phone.The iphone's back has many hairline scratchesand Battery life is very short. Is only one-fifth of the normal.Setup iOS version is 9.0, so iphone speed is very slow.OMG purchase.",1
"I'm trying to activate the phone and it's asking for a passcode? I bought as a gift for a first time phone for my nephew and apparently wasted my money. It didn't do this the first time I turned it on and now that I want to activate it, I can't do anything.",1
"the phone did not work, I took it to the apple store and it could not be repaired. I ended up trading it in on another 4s that did work .The phone would not pick up my wi fi or any wi fi. It still cost me another $199.00 but it made my little girl happy. It cost me $102.00 for your phone and 199.00 for the new one. No more refurbished for me.",1
"Just received my order for 2 unlocked GSM iPhone 4s & 2 Gorilla glass heavy duty cases. Both phones are Verizon CDMA carrier unlocked which is NOT AT&T or Team Mobile GSM unlocked! Also, 1 of the 2 Gorilla glass case came shattered inside the bubble wrap! Rrrrrrrr😡 Only good thing was package arrived in 24 hours only for me to have to return!",1
I love the phone it works great. But one slight problem. You sent the wrong kind of charger for it. I needed one for an iPhone 4s and you sent Ike for a 5s or newer,5
"Genuine new iphone 4s- packaging, charger , earphone not sure but the phone is absolutely new and works great. Great audio clarity, battery performance so far(10-15 days usage only so far). Is unlocked and work like charm with unlocked gsm sim. Great purchase very happy",5
"I bought 2 iphones..one was ok..the other was not unlocked, i sended it to my country and it doesn't work..so now what?i lost my 💰?..because i can't see any option to return the phone",1
"The phone was, contrary to my fears, actually unlocked! I was able to put in my SIM card immediately. The charger, however, was not made by Apple, and the end of the rubber cable was frayed and already disconnected.",4
This is not as advertised. Tried to buy and load a SIM card at a cell phone service provider in Vietnam. Could not get it to work . Do not buy this phone,1
Was surprised that the volume on the phone is 1/2 as loud as my original phone purchased new 4 years ago. Bought this one as a gift and the ring is not very loud. Exterior had only a couple of minor scratches which was expected for a refurbished.,3
"The phone works ..not sure if its unlocked to work with any carrier , but its unlocked i currently have metro pcs and my sim card did not work in phone..i did not get headphones with the phone but overall the phone is in mint condition",3
"Phone was not unlocked.I was referred to Apple. Apple said, 2 service techs, the phone was still locked to the Cloud. The prices quoted to have device unlocked in the $50 to $200 range. With no guarantee of success.Due to circumstances, the phone was a gift to someone out of the country, I am out the money.",1
Such a worst experience with this buy. This phone is not unlocked and battery is draining out like anything. Keep away from this dealer.I bought another 4s unlocked from lukki_lukki dealer and it's unlocked and in perfect shape.Returning this! !,1
Not happy at all... I bought this phone that is Supposed to be unlocked But it's not at all. So know I have to figure out how to unlock it since it's my daughter birthday gift that she can't even use now...grrr,1
"Though the product is good but the battery worked pathetic. I had to charge the phone three times a day. If a phone is factory refurbished, then don't they check the battery quality? Anyway, I returned the product in a week.",1
Sometimes one can be a little skeptical when purchasing a refurbished iphone. I had 2 positive experience with iphone I bought from this company. The iphone has been working flawlessly.,5
Bought the phone but I need the previous owner itune login in order to use the iphone. Who can I contact to get this information or request a new one.,1
I am very unhappy with this purchase. I've had to charge this phone at minimum twice a day and if you like to use apps than much more charging would be required.,2
I thought I was going to receive an UNLOCKED cell phone. It appears that it's not because I have been to 2 different phone stores and they can't get it working.,1
I took the phone to the Verizon Store in Lexington SC. They told me they could not activate the phone because it is not one of thier's. what do you suggest I do with this phone?,2
"OK..Did not come with SIM card slot pin.Did not come with ""includes all original accessories"" as stated in the product description.The included charger is cheaply made.Has some scratches.",3
"iPhone looks new ,it works in my countryIt does not comes with complete accessories and original boxCharger adapter US standard not EUROPE, I have to buy Europe standard charger adapter",4
The phone has issues with the text part it deletes texts after a bit and won't put up notifications when I do get texts its a big pos sorry I bought I don't recommend buying anything from the seller,1
"It came exactly when they said it would and the phone looks brand new. So far, the only problem I've had with it is that it froze on me once, but other than that I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.",4
Its was not unlocked I tried to put cricket wireless for it and it keep telling me the sim was invalid so I called Cricket Wireless and they told me to call Sprint and they told me it was not unlocked,1
"On the amazon site, it listed it as a new phone rather than refurbished. Although I wouldn't expect a new phone that is so dated, it should have been listed as refurbished. The phone itself is fine and works well.",4
"hi, i would like to contact you about the Apple iPhone 4S. I bought 2 iPhone and one of the two came damaged. The cell phone turns off evens with full battery. Please contact as soon as possible to solve the problem. Thank to you.Apple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked GSM - White (Certified Refurbished)",2
"Yeah, I still own an older iphone 4s, but it's a great deal for a quality product. Unfortunately, the camera cannot be silenced because this is an import model from Japan, but that info was not shared in the description. Also, the volume down button will not function; I have to use the CC menu.",3
My iPhone 4S Unlocked was received on time and was packaged like a brand new phone. It was unlocked as advertised. I was able to activate it with my new SIM chip without any problems. It had to be setup like a new phone. We are very pleased and would recommend this phone.,5
Never buy this item in TECHarvard. Received 4 used iPhones in absolutely awful condition. Some of them with used batteries and not original low quality parts.,1
It is awesome! I have been wanting an iPhone 4s for a while now and finally got the money to buy it. The phone works 100%. You can add a carrier to it. It works just like any other iPhone too,5
Llego well but with the default screen calls chokes and reheated too when charging the battery would give me warranty then could not make the claim before because just a week ago I get the product because I am from Venezuela and slow as I can solve this problem?,1
Phones appear to be in good condition. Not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap. The USB cable came apart while charging the first time. Reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so I just went to find my own replacement Hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger....,3
"not buying! It does not work: does not play audio from videos or ring when they call, no charge! and I am now in Colombia and I can not return it! And Amazon is not responding!",1
"Not happy at all, I am returning the phone. It's not compatible with Verizon ! Waited a week for the phone to go to my store to activate and use and it's only compatible with ATT",1
"Originally, I was unsure about this phone as the reviews aren't great. However, my phone came in great condition and so far am not having problems with it.",5
Problem of battery or phone ??? Obligate to charge it 4 or 5 time a day and the battery indicate 80% one minute later it 30% and when you plug it one second indicate charge 60%,1
"Phone was in good shape and working order. With a bit of help from T-mobile to remove previous user information all was well. However, after about 6 months it is completely unreliable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Battery life is atrocious. Total waste of money.",1
Came sooner than expected. First one stopped coming on (wouldn't load) after a year. Liked the phone so much bought another one. This one looks and works fine.,5
We ordered this factory refurbished phone! We missed the return date otherwise we would have returned it! It really never worked properly! We will never buy a refurbished phone again! It is a scam!,1
Battery dies too prematurely compared to my store-bought iPhone 4 yrs ago. And one of the audio speakers does not work - it arrived this way. Would not buy from this dealer again.,2
Came on time loved it looks even bigger than expected...having turned it on as yet but I'm blown over thought it would have looked bad....only thing I wish it came with the headphone and manual that wud a have been a plus buuuuttttt love love love my new iPhone thanks amazon love yah.......,5
The iphone 4S was in pristine condition even though the description may not claim so. Also it was unlocked and I checked to see that it worked in AT&T. I sent the phone to India for use on the GSM network over there. I am very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended for the price. I paid $85 in July 2016.,5
Doesn't have enough space. I only have about 30 pictures and it won't let me take anymore. Also have to delete texts constantly. I haven't downloaded any apps.,2
"Battery life is pretty short... I'd say 3 hours when using the internet the whole time. If I don't use it much it will last through the day. Other than that, it was unlocked and everything seems to work",3
I love it a lot! The iPhone 4/4S is my favorite designed Apple phone yet. I love everything about it despite not being able to upgrade passed IOS 9.3.,4
"Got here a day early, however the battery would constantly act up, the phone would shut off and say it was dead, it over heated and lastly--it just stopped sending texts. Returning asap.",1
Won't stay charged and screen had a nice scratch in to plus chips off the bottom of the phone where it's been dropped a few times.. Supposed to be refurbished but all that was done was factory reset...,1
The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it was in good physical condition. The phone would not activate or even recognize a AT&T signal. Not unlocked and not useful. Sent back and gave up after reading endless other negative reviews. These used phone peddlers are definitely the bad apples in Amazons barrel.,2
"OMG what a great buy! This phone is in perfect condition. We were able to set it up without even contacting the carrier, just switched over the sim card. For a teenager wanting an iphone, this was a great investment/starter.",5
Phone is not unlocked as described. It is a Verizon phone. Waited a long time for this phone as I live in Central America and can't return it. What a waste of time and money.,1
"The phone was the correct color and in perfect condition. I had to return it because after taking it to multiple carriers...TMobile, Verizon, and Sprint no one would support it on their network. Evidently unlocked 4s's have this issue.",3
"Well,...my iPhone came like new.....unlocked...on time and i am a happy customer...I would buy again from this company...thank you and good job...P.S...it was fairly priced too...",5
"The Battery goes out in 10 minute with a full charge and the processor doesn't function right, it freezes and stuff. It worked okay for about 1 month.",1
"Even though the description says this refurbed phone was unlocked, we wasted an hour in the Verizon store trying to get it activated. What a waste of time.",1
"My first review on Amazon after being a customer for over a decade. This is a total fraud, the charger is cheap off the street, as for apple packaging see the picture of attached box and the plastic sleeve it came in.",1
"The appearance of the phone is excellent , like new. The battery life is good. It had a Verizon related sticker on the back but it is indeed unlocked. It is a GSM phone. I took it to Mexico to use there and got a SIM and number from Telcel without any problems. It works very well.",5
Is in perfect condition and is unlocked. all ports work well. It is just as fast as my other iPhone 4s was and can download the current iSO. only problem is that the phone gets really hot really quickly and the battery seems to run out a little faster than normal. comes in a fancy box with a clear top and a charger.,4
It came on time was happy about it but the charger was not the right one sad can't use it. The surface looks good no scratches but the speaker is not working well when making a call .,3
The telephone is in exquisite condition. Also everything is wonderful in regards to the performance of the telephone. Should the need occur in the future...there will not be any hesitation for me to purchase another telephone by using Amazon.com.,5
Product was a gift for someone. Once they received the phone and attempted to use it the return window was over:( we charged the phone for first time use and determined the battery will not hold a charge and drained within a few hours with minimal use.,1
I write pretty good worried because last week received the cell phone to buy him but it does not work because it does not connect to the wireless network as hacerpara that we could change me,1
"Arrived quickly, had to buy it because my phone din't work on the Us networks, now this iPhone works both in the USA and in Holland, so definitely unlocked. Battery was my initial concern with buying a used phone but lasts a whole day with a lot of use and 2-3 days with less use so really happy. Definitely can recommend.",5
The title says it is unlocked. But acctually it is locked to verizon. What happened to Amazon? There are more and more liers now. I am really disappointed.,1
The phone looks great and was well packaged. At first I was concerned that the phone was not fully unlocked because it was a verizon phone but everything works great. I dont know why some customers had issues with this phone being an old verizon phone unless they just never tried putting a sim card in it but im satisfied with everything,5
"The Betry of this phone is almost dead, I mean it gives maxi 3 hours similarly they said factory unlocked but it is not factory unlock it is At&t phone so I am don't need it I am gona send it back...",1
"I bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it. The phone came in perfect condition. The sim card slot is regular size not micro, which is what I needed. Otherwise I would have had to buy a micro sim kit. Very happy with my purchase.",5
i boutght two of this... one came in OK condition... The other one comes with scratches and with a battery that wont last 1 hour... i am very dissapointed.,1
"This was a gift for my wife and she is happy with it but. Everything works fine except for wi-fi, that is greyed out and not usable. Just google wi-fi issues on iPhone 4s and you will see what I mean. You make your own mind on this one",2
"iPhone arrived within 2 days in Excellent condition. I couldn't find the minor scratches mentioned in the description. Unlocked, as promised. Connected to T-Mobile as soon as I inserted my sim card. Activated phone and synced iTunes. I am very pleased with this purchase!",5
Good evening I'm just receiving this iPhone and it's a Verizon iPhone and it's locked.. I need your help to return this item and buy the unlocked cell...,1
When I received this phone I was very impressed by how well the outside of the phone looked. It looked new. Unfortunately when I turned it on there were a few very faint but noticible yellow lines going down the screen. I returned it because I was nervous that this could become a major issue in the future.,2
"I actually am very happy with it, I got it for my little sister, who really wanted it.I was iffy at first but it works well and it looks great. Will be adding pictures later.",5
Phone was in amazing condition!! is unlocked but WILL NOT work with Verizon. It is a GSM phone which means only services like T-Mobile and AT&T will be able to activate it,3
"Worst!!!Worst!!!Worst...this is not a new phone and it's unlocked AT&T, phone comes with improper packing normal cartron box,After 15 days usage phone charge has defected, now charger is not working, waste of money, do not recommended this seller, since the item is not what they described.",1
"Phones had to be returned because, even though they were advertised as ""Unlocked,Works on any GMS (Global System for Mobile) Worldwide"", they will NOT WORK with Verizon. According to tracking record, Vantage received the returned phones on December 10, but we still do not have a refund over three weeks later.",1
"The phone came in exactly as described, if not better! It had no scratches, and if there was, I couldn't see it. I had it set up to T-mobile and it was super easy! She even gave me her old cases with no extra charge- which really helped! It's been about a month and I'm still content and happy with my purchase! Thank you!",5
After a year of buying this IPhone from this vendor I had to send it to repair at a Apple Store. To my surprise I discovered that this item was sold to me as new but was not new. It was refurbished in China or Hong Kong. Was not a new item. Do not trust this vendor. He does not sell new items. He sells refurbished as new. Be careful.,2
i bouth an unlocked iphone and it comes locked :/i whish the amazon.com service culd do something to resolve this big problem cause a pay for de iphone and now i cant use,1
"It is not a new phone like the seller announced, and it even doesn't work, the system always can not find the sim card. When I find the seller is from Shenzhen China, you know, hehe.I'll have a trip to Shenzhen, China in the end of May, I think maybe I should go to visit the seller?",2
I received this phone as described truly mint condition. I received it quickly. This seller added a phone cover as an unexpectedly nice touch. I am thrilled with the iPhone 4S. This is my first iPhone I had no idea what I had been missing its fabulous.,5
The delivery process was quick and excellent. The only thing that was a negative was the fact that the screw for the sim card slot did not come with my iPhone 4s. I now have to buy one because It was not included in my box.,5
"Love it! Everything and more than I expected! How did I come right without it?! Ha! Siri is great, delivery was fast, phone condition is as mentioned. 5 stars all around!",5
The IPHONE 4S 32 G I bought is just like NEW! No scratches at all (films are still on it) and works perfect with my local company here in the Caribbean. The delivery was super fast too!! Thank you!,5
I order this and upon receipt of the order found that this item was defective and not what was advertised. When I approached the seller he refuse to refund me saying that it was over a month old and he did not guarantee the item after a month. I advise any one else who buys from this seller examine closely your product before doing anything else.,1
Worked perfectly!I received the phone and insert the micro SIM card and voilà! Everything worked perfectly. No need to crack or jail-break the phone.I'm very satisfied with my new iPhone.,5
"I changed by Blackberry for this iphone 4S, but the battery is maximum 8 hours life, compared to my ex bb, more than 24 hours. The bb is more friendly than this iphone.",2
"It's an iPhone, need I say more?Simply outstanding. I just inserted a micro sim card from my mobile operator and it worked perfeclty (i live outside the US)",5
"I received my iphone closed and i hope new, however, the accesories are not original and also I doubt the phone could be original! But ok. Also, the box was no the box, I mean, my phone is white, on the box is black, and I bought it 32 gb and the phone is 64 gb, maybe not too bad.",2
I want to say with not too many Reviews for this company I was skeptical about purchasing the iphone 4S from them. But I took a chance and when I received the product so quickly I was amazed on how quickly it was shipped to me. Also want to add that the iPhone 4S I had received is AWESOME with a great price. Thanks!!!,5
"it doesnt say anywhere that it was used, and for the price i payed i thought it was new. I got it ON and with apps downloades... they didnt even took the time to clean it up...very dissapointed",2
"The phone is great, excellent and completely free. I am very happy with my new iPhone. I tried in my country with the three telephone operators and working properly. I recommend it 100%.",5
"The display went off after one week of use. I sent the product back to the seller. They fixed the display, but the battery is not charging. This process took three to four months and I am with a Iphone that does not work",1

It don't work for T-Mobile i went to the store and they said it was with Verizon and sprint so if you have those your good but when I got the phone is was in great condition,1

"The phones were.probably fine. The problem was that they were advertised as. ""NEW"" but their warranties were expired. In my mind, that negates their new status. They were in fact used and as is and that could be false advertisement. Also...much too expensive under those circumstances.",2

"I will be sending this phone back for a return and full refund. I had high hopes that this phone would work with PagePlus Celluar. Unfortunately, after a week I received this the mic started to malfunction to the point where I could only hear people if I put them on speaker phone. Wish this would of worked out because the price was great!",2
I would of gave it five stars. The phone looked great. The only issue was that it was still attached too the previous owners iTunes account. There for I was unable to activate this phone.,3
"I had the 5s, 16 gb. I hated to downgrade, but Tracfone wouldn't support the 5s. The 4s I had before and it was fine. I don't know why I had to upgrade in the first place. The 4s is perfectly capable as a phone.",5

I had an iPad before purchasing this phone, so I had no difficulties making the switch from a droid to an iPhone. It needs the ios7 update, which I haven't had the time to download yet.",5

"This is an excellent device with extremely high quality build. I would still recommend apple over any other brand, they are still a bit pricey and would do well to build a mid range product line.",5
"do not buy this item from WAR HOUSE. the seller has disguised it as a new, When I open the box, the serial number is unvalid, and the earphone is fake, the adapter is not for USA.",1
"The product description says these are Unlocked GSM phones, however, some are not. I received a Verizon (CDMA) phone (see pic).. I returned it. Also the chargers are not original, which is fine, but at least the generic should work to charge the phone. I'll buy something else.",1

But there are a lot of internal problems...the speakers for the phone aren't good you can't hear the other person on the other line unless you have the phone plugged in the head set. The jack to place the headphones is loose and works on and off. I would have liked to return but needed a phone ASAP and couldn't wait for a replacement to come.,2
"The charger didn't work, refurbished (I didn't know) with cheap aftermarket parts. Front glass broke from just putting it in my pocket, not from dropping.",4
"A great purchase for my son and he enjoys it. Although the seller said it was used, we couldn't tell...looks and functions brand new. He watches movies, listens to music and download all the time. He has enough memory... 64GB. Great purchase!!!",5
The price was Great. Shipped nicely However the charger cord did not work and there were a few more cracks and marks on the phone than the ad portrayed. Really do give the purchase a thumbs up in spite of.,4
"The phone works wonderfully. Can't really tell it was used. I used it in the US with a T mobile sim and now in France-- no issues. The price was great, too. Just can't imagine spending more on a phone that could get lost or stolen, and this does everything.",5
The shipping did not take a month as the estimate says more like 4 days in my case. Phone works well so far. Cosmetically clean very little wear. No complaints at all😜!,5
I received it and it is good condition. No scratch or anything. And I put straight talk SIM card and it work very good and iOS 9 is update. Very little slow but good quality etc. I love it. I suggest people who can't afford iPhone 6s. Buy this one. Good company,5
Came as described. Has lasted 6 months so far. That's the longest my teenager has ever owned a phone without breaking it. I was leery buying a phone through Amazon as I have heard some horror stories but this was a great purchase. Great buy at th right price.,5
Looks good. Works good. Accessories are really bad. I'm using my old original USB to charge the phone. It shows a label with Verizon locked on the back of the phone. But it works fine for T-mobile. So far it's working fine. Let's see what happen,4
"This phone came amazingly fast! In good condition for a used phone, only two tiny nicks that can be covered by a case. Bought it for a Christmas present for a family member and I'm sure she's gonna love it. Totally a steal!",4
"Comparing to the Samsung Galaxy s3 the iPhone 4s is far behind in speed, flexibility, display... And almost everything else except battery life. The s3 sells for about the same price.",3
"I recently bought this, and it doesn't charge. It's not new. It's refurbished. do not buy this is not new and it won't work. I don't know how Amazon allows this. Pretty bad choice.",1
It was listed as unlocked. I live out of the country most of the year and need to have ability to change chips. It came locked and would not function. I did not know that until I had left the US. My local international carrier wants to charge me an additiona $120 to unlock it. It was a gift for my husband and he is irritated with me!!!,1
"The iPhone wasn't unlocked, it had double barriers one was the iPhone by itself, the previous owner had to open his iPhone account to unlock the phone first, second ATT account was also locked.So in summary it never was unlocked.",1
The phone arrived ontime. The phone was locked and I was mislead by seller as he sold the phone advirtising as it's unlocked. I had to spend approx $80 to unlock the phone. I am very disappointed with this purchase as seller should have mentioned about the lock system upfont.,1
"I bought this as a gift for a friend and she has been satisfied with it so far. Only problem was how long it took to arrive, but all in all, a good buy.",4
"So I got a SIM card for the phone, I put it in and It says t-mobile but i didn't even get a t-mobile SIM card for it? I tested it out and I can't call anyone?",3
Not 8GB as advertised and their advise was to reset phone to factory defaults. Great after everything I went through to get the info from the old phone.,2
"Awesome phone, I'm probably the happiest person right now on earth regarding some concerns that I had with online shopping. The phone arrived in time, brand new and sealed off, unlocked with earphones and wall charge + cable☺️☺️☺️",5
good afternoon here sending them to the guide number of returning the phone 984 370 by MRW was sent arrived today and as in 5 days. the battery is bad but was tested with new batteries and neither works. I hope I made the reimbursement of money,1
Sent me a locked phone. It was suppose to be unlocked. Now i cant use it and i am out of the country and cant return it. Would love some advice on how to unlock it somehow.,1

"Both phones we ordered are in excellent condition, brand new, beautiful and completely unlocked. The phones accepted our SIM cards without a glitch and they are both working wonderfully. We couldn't be happier with the purchase, thank you.",5
I was so happyabout this iphone. Its flawless front and back body case. So far i am not having problem with it. My Nephew wil be happy as i send it to the Philippines:) willbe glad to buy another one with Buymax!!!Kiyomi,5
I don't know what is wrong with it .It just get chargeless very quick and don't want to get charge easily either. Let me know if u have any idea to make it work better. Thankyou.,4
Phone was stated as unlocked but actually came up as stolen and locked to AT&T. So my Tmobile sim card was absolutely blocked and would not pick up service.,1
I give it 3 stars because it's a sprint phone & I needed a t-mobile. I even contact the seller b4 I purchased it to make sure it will work for T-mobile. I'm so mad because it was a gift to someone,3
Not five stars because it's IOS is not compatible with several APPS my daughter wanted to use like she did on her old Tracfone. It is our first iPhone so we had a lot of learning to do. We did transfer her service to this phone with my agony but it is done. Have to purchase minuets through their website but all minuets are tripled that is nice.,4
"Got it as a gift for my stepsister who didn't want one of those bigger new iphones. She absolutely loves it, and the setup wasn't too difficult either.",5
"This phone will not turn in. After use of less than 1 month, I cannot turn my phone on. I didn't start using it until April 26. The battery was fully charged I took it off the charger and when I attempted to turn it on nothing. This is poor service.",2
Please do not waste your time and money. The phone I got was not unlocked. It was locked to Verizon and I needed T-Mobile . some people have gotten lucky and received an unlocked phone. But that was not my case.,1
"the phone battery life sucks, at most it has to be charged every 5-6 hours, it also over heats a lot...the phone came in new box, had all new accessories, works great for the price i had...ive streaming is excellent.had phone about month and im very happy still..setup was very easy",3
"the phone never work, I took it to an Apple Authorized technician who confirmed that the phone had already been opened... I have been cheated. what can I do? Apple iPhone 4S 8GB Unlocked GSM Cell Phone w/ Siri and iCloud - White",1
The phone was exactly as described and appeared. I took it to the apple store and they set it up for me. It is so much easier to use that the android I traded in. Love the phone.,5

"Product arrived in time. It was well protected by package. I was well surprised on how new the product is. It works perfectly, there were no scrathes whatsoever and came in the box with all acessories. I surely recomend the seller.",5
"I was expecting it after July 13th, but I received it on 10th of July. The phone was totaly new and UNLOCKED. I satisfied it very much. Thank you so much Amazon.",5
"Exactly how it was described. Unlocked, fast delivery no problems linking up to my T-Mobile carrier. Just switch the Sim card and worked immediately. Packaged like I just bought it from Apple.",5
"Both phones we ordered are in excellent condition, brand new, beautiful and completely unlocked. The phones accepted our SIM cards without a glitch and they are both working wonderfully. We couldn't be happier with the purchase, thank you.",5

I hate this product. My phone doesn't hold charge. It jumps me off apps when I'm on them. Just dont get this product. I was very disappointed in this product. I really want my money back.,1
"Awesome phone, I'm probably the happiest person right now on earth regarding some concerns that I had with online shopping. The phone arrived in time, brand new and sealed off, unlocked with earphones and wall charge + cable☺️☺️☺️",5
good afternoon here sending them to the guide number of returning the phone 984 370 by MRW was sent arrived today and as in 5 days. the battery is bad but was tested with new batteries and neither works. I hope I made the reimbursement of money,1
It was listed as unlocked. I live out of the country most of the year and need to have ability to change chips. It came locked and would not function. I did not know that until I had left the US. My local international carrier wants to charge me an additiona $120 to unlock it. It was a gift for my husband and he is irritated with me!!!,1
"The iPhone wasn't unlocked, it had double barriers one was the iPhone by itself, the previous owner had to open his iPhone account to unlock the phone first, second ATT account was also locked.So in summary it never was unlocked.",1
The phone arrived ontime. The phone was locked and I was mislead by seller as he sold the phone advirtising as it's unlocked. I had to spend approx $80 to unlock the phone. I am very disappointed with this purchase as seller should have mentioned about the lock system upfont.,1
I give it 3 stars because it's a sprint phone & I needed a t-mobile. I even contact the seller b4 I purchased it to make sure it will work for T-mobile. I'm so mad because it was a gift to someone,3
"the phone never work, I took it to an Apple Authorized technician who confirmed that the phone had already been opened... I have been cheated. what can I do? Apple iPhone 4S 8GB Unlocked GSM Cell Phone w/ Siri and iCloud - White",1
The phone was exactly as described and appeared. I took it to the apple store and they set it up for me. It is so much easier to use that the android I traded in. Love the phone.,5
"the phone battery life sucks, at most it has to be charged every 5-6 hours, it also over heats a lot...the phone came in new box, had all new accessories, works great for the price i had...ive streaming is excellent.had phone about month and im very happy still..setup was very easy",3
"So I got a SIM card for the phone, I put it in and It says t-mobile but i didn't even get a t-mobile SIM card for it? I tested it out and I can't call anyone?",3
Not 8GB as advertised and their advise was to reset phone to factory defaults. Great after everything I went through to get the info from the old phone.,2
"This phone will not turn in. After use of less than 1 month, I cannot turn my phone on. I didn't start using it until April 26. The battery was fully charged I took it off the charger and when I attempted to turn it on nothing. This is poor service.",2
Please do not waste your time and money. The phone I got was not unlocked. It was locked to Verizon and I needed T-Mobile . some people have gotten lucky and received an unlocked phone. But that was not my case.,1
Sent me a locked phone. It was suppose to be unlocked. Now i cant use it and i am out of the country and cant return it. Would love some advice on how to unlock it somehow.,1
overall decent when i first got it with some freezes some here and there. Now it is totally acting weird. I started using it mid Agust and now it is february soOOO,3

I don't know what is wrong with it .It just get chargeless very quick and don't want to get charge easily either. Let me know if u have any idea to make it work better. Thankyou.,4
Phone was stated as unlocked but actually came up as stolen and locked to AT&T. So my Tmobile sim card was absolutely blocked and would not pick up service.,1
"I recently bought this, and it doesn't charge. It's not new. It's refurbished. do not buy this is not new and it won't work. I don't know how Amazon allows this. Pretty bad choice.",1
"Product arrived in time. It was well protected by package. I was well surprised on how new the product is. It works perfectly, there were no scrathes whatsoever and came in the box with all acessories. I surely recomend the seller.",5

"The phone works ..not sure if its unlocked to work with any carrier , but its unlocked i currently have metro pcs and my sim card did not work in phone..i did not get headphones with the phone but overall the phone is in mint condition",3
The phone stopped working after less than 30 days. I'm in Argentina and it's impossible to ship items from other countries in here. I guess it's a waste of time and money. Extremely dissapointed of my purchase and don't have any plans to shop again here.,1
Lasted for around 27 days now it won't hold a charge. I loved it when it first game updated it to ios 9.1.2 and it screwed me over not even a month what it. I don't even know what to do.EDIT: Product works. It was just the power brick that came with it. It no longer works. I do have another power brick and the phone does hold a charge.,5
"Although this did not come with original accessories as stated, knock off charger and no headphones which were include in the original accessories of the iphone 4, the phone seems to work fine for my teenager, the exterior is in excellent shape. Will update when I take it to our carrier.",3
I purchased this phone for my son on July 7 and on August 9 the phone conveniently died. It wouldn't charge at all and sits here as a tribute to my stupidity for listening to my teenage son who told me about purchasing a refurbished phone-- I know betterTHIS IS A SCAM! Do not buy this phone!,1
"Iphone arrived in perfect condition, looks absolutely brand new. Battery life is great and it seems that the phone has never been used. We activated on Tracfone using their BYOP sim card and had no issues.",5
Its was not unlocked I tried to put cricket wireless for it and it keep telling me the sim was invalid so I called Cricket Wireless and they told me to call Sprint and they told me it was not unlocked,1
Came on time loved it looks even bigger than expected...having turned it on as yet but I'm blown over thought it would have looked bad....only thing I wish it came with the headphone and manual that wud a have been a plus buuuuttttt love love love my new iPhone thanks amazon love yah.......,5
The iphone 4S was in pristine condition even though the description may not claim so. Also it was unlocked and I checked to see that it worked in AT&T. I sent the phone to India for use on the GSM network over there. I am very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended for the price. I paid $85 in July 2016.,5
Doesn't have enough space. I only have about 30 pictures and it won't let me take anymore. Also have to delete texts constantly. I haven't downloaded any apps.,2
"Phone works ok but, i received a broken charger? it was completely disconnected from the piece and my home button kinda sticks but other then that it is ok find out tomorrow if cricket accepts it.",3
To my relief my phone worked fine. Ironically I could not activate on Verizon as a prepaid phone but it worked fine with Tracfone. I do not have any battery issues. This is just a backup phone anyway. It is not being used as a primary phone. I use it while I travel so I don't risk losing the more expensive version of this phone,5
Well this phone is breaking everyday like charger just broke left speaker don't work and when u talk on the phone I have to put it on speaker to hear something,2
Hello! Acquire thisApple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished) product and the same presentaa problem with the handset (not olle ) what is the procedure to enforce the guarantee,3
The battery life is horrible. I changed it fully before leaving home. Within few hours the battery was close to 10 %. It was hardly used for 10 mins of call. This seems to useless. Hope to return the device.,1
"It works! It doesn't hold a charge all day but it is ok for now. Not sure I would buy a refurbished again, especially from this seller due to the under charging.",3
"Aside from relatively quickly dying battery, phone is very good. Please be sure to understand your ""carrier/service provider's"" cellular phone requirements before buying this.",4
"It's a good quality phone had a problem updating it, but after that works fine, but someone changed the password to my account so might be something but overall okay buy",3
"buy two phones refurbished and have received USED micas screen with marks and scratches from use of protective liners or cases , the metal bezel with many brands use too. that just hurts the just received in Venezuela if not immediately returned .",1
Is in perfect condition and is unlocked. all ports work well. It is just as fast as my other iPhone 4s was and can download the current iSO. only problem is that the phone gets really hot really quickly and the battery seems to run out a little faster than normal. comes in a fancy box with a clear top and a charger.,4
It came on time was happy about it but the charger was not the right one sad can't use it. The surface looks good no scratches but the speaker is not working well when making a call .,3
The telephone is in exquisite condition. Also everything is wonderful in regards to the performance of the telephone. Should the need occur in the future...there will not be any hesitation for me to purchase another telephone by using Amazon.com.,5
Llego well but with the default screen calls chokes and reheated too when charging the battery would give me warranty then could not make the claim before because just a week ago I get the product because I am from Venezuela and slow as I can solve this problem?,1
Phones appear to be in good condition. Not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap. The USB cable came apart while charging the first time. Reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so I just went to find my own replacement Hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger....,3
"not buying! It does not work: does not play audio from videos or ring when they call, no charge! and I am now in Colombia and I can not return it! And Amazon is not responding!",1
It's was somewhat okay being that it's refurbished. But I had expected be neater than it was.And I didn't expect the accessories to more than a charger. At least an earpiece added would not be bad.,3
"After 5 full discharge and 5 full charge, I get just over 48 hours of stand-by time of battery life. According to the specifications I found on line, the stand-by time should be closer to 200 hours. This is the last time I purchase any refurbished product.",1
The good news is that it was an unlocked phone. And I was able to go to any carrier to start it up.The bad news is that it does not have a good battery life. The phone loses its charge very quickly!,2
"I'm trying to activate the phone and it's asking for a passcode? I bought as a gift for a first time phone for my nephew and apparently wasted my money. It didn't do this the first time I turned it on and now that I want to activate it, I can't do anything.",1
"the phone did not work, I took it to the apple store and it could not be repaired. I ended up trading it in on another 4s that did work .The phone would not pick up my wi fi or any wi fi. It still cost me another $199.00 but it made my little girl happy. It cost me $102.00 for your phone and 199.00 for the new one. No more refurbished for me.",1
"In the publication you say the cellphone have all the originals accessories, you only send me the cellphone with a not original charger, you don't send me headphones. I need comunicate with the you.",2
"This phone worked great....until I went to purchase service from a no contract company, and they informed me that this phone was not on their list of unlocked phones. It's stuck on a Verizon Pre-Paid plan. My advice, keep looking.",1
"So it's been a month since I bought this product for my mom. So far so good, I mean it is an iPhone 4S, you can't really set your expectations too high. Yes, when I received the phone there was a sticker in the back that said that the carrier was Verizon. However, I took it to my Metro store and there was NO PROBLEM connecting it to this carrier.",5
"OMG what a great buy! This phone is in perfect condition. We were able to set it up without even contacting the carrier, just switched over the sim card. For a teenager wanting an iphone, this was a great investment/starter.",5
Phone is not unlocked as described. It is a Verizon phone. Waited a long time for this phone as I live in Central America and can't return it. What a waste of time and money.,1
"The phone was the correct color and in perfect condition. I had to return it because after taking it to multiple carriers...TMobile, Verizon, and Sprint no one would support it on their network. Evidently unlocked 4s's have this issue.",3
Came sooner than expected. First one stopped coming on (wouldn't load) after a year. Liked the phone so much bought another one. This one looks and works fine.,5
We ordered this factory refurbished phone! We missed the return date otherwise we would have returned it! It really never worked properly! We will never buy a refurbished phone again! It is a scam!,1
The phone looks brand new! There are no scratches anywhere. The charger was even wrapped as the new ones! I've tried it with my at&t unlocked sim card and with an international sim card and it works perfectly so far.,5
"I bought this for my husband because his 5 yr old phone finally gave up the ghost. This works well enough. It is a little slow, but that is probably because it is older and refurbished.",4
"It came exactly when they said it would and the phone looks brand new. So far, the only problem I've had with it is that it froze on me once, but other than that I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.",4
Received the phone quickly. Everything worked very well except screen has a rattle noise when phone vibrates possibly from loose screen when refurbished. But works perfectly and not a big deal.,4
This phone will not stay connected to Wi-Fi. It is unusable and continually says no service. Very disappointing! We have tried rebooting the phone multiple times to no avail. We kept trying new things to make it work and we are now past the return date. What a waste! So frustrating.,1
The phone has a small scratch on the screen upon delivery. It isn't terrible and it is a refurbished phone. Worked great out of the box. Satisfied with the purchase overall.,4
"Great condition, great phone. Normal battery. Once I was shocked by the 1 star reviews, finally I divided to give it a shot. I'm sure that I love this one. Only two cons:1, The OS is IOS 9, which is very difficult to be downgraded and kind of slow for iphone 4s. 2, The battery is not so good. I will replace the battery with a bigger capacity one.",5
"After about three weeks of use, I noticed the battery running out very quickly. Now, sometimes it goes from 68% to dead instantaneously, and sometimes it will stay on 1% for hours.I know it was refurbished, but I didn't expect the battery to fail that quickly. I'm disappointed, to say the least, and the phone is no longer eligible for return.",2
"Genuine new iphone 4s- packaging, charger , earphone not sure but the phone is absolutely new and works great. Great audio clarity, battery performance so far(10-15 days usage only so far). Is unlocked and work like charm with unlocked gsm sim. Great purchase very happy",5
"I bought 2 iphones..one was ok..the other was not unlocked, i sended it to my country and it doesn't work..so now what?i lost my 💰?..because i can't see any option to return the phone",1
"The phone was, contrary to my fears, actually unlocked! I was able to put in my SIM card immediately. The charger, however, was not made by Apple, and the end of the rubber cable was frayed and already disconnected.",4
This is not as advertised. Tried to buy and load a SIM card at a cell phone service provider in Vietnam. Could not get it to work . Do not buy this phone,1
"hi, i would like to contact you about the Apple iPhone 4S. I bought 2 iPhone and one of the two came damaged. The cell phone turns off evens with full battery. Please contact as soon as possible to solve the problem. Thank to you.Apple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked GSM - White (Certified Refurbished)",2
"Yeah, I still own an older iphone 4s, but it's a great deal for a quality product. Unfortunately, the camera cannot be silenced because this is an import model from Japan, but that info was not shared in the description. Also, the volume down button will not function; I have to use the CC menu.",3
Was surprised that the volume on the phone is 1/2 as loud as my original phone purchased new 4 years ago. Bought this one as a gift and the ring is not very loud. Exterior had only a couple of minor scratches which was expected for a refurbished.,3
Not happy at all... I bought this phone that is Supposed to be unlocked But it's not at all. So know I have to figure out how to unlock it since it's my daughter birthday gift that she can't even use now...grrr,1
"Many people said ""why are you buying 4s now?"", but I just had this need for an iPhone and purchased this. As the result, I am pretty happy about it. It works fine and the phone is brand new. It's delivered very quickly. 5 stars!",5
"Phone was in good shape and working order. With a bit of help from T-mobile to remove previous user information all was well. However, after about 6 months it is completely unreliable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Battery life is atrocious. Total waste of money.",1
In pristine condition. I went to the Apple Store and they confirmed that it was unblocked. We leave for South Africa and the Maldives for 7 weeks and I will buy a local SIM card. Then I will know for sure if it works.,5
"Well,...my iPhone came like new.....unlocked...on time and i am a happy customer...I would buy again from this company...thank you and good job...P.S...it was fairly priced too...",5
I receive my phone on time and it really awesome!!!! I also like how it work but sometime it take time like 2 minute to wait for loading a program like Facebook and some other app....but I like it anyway,3
"Cosmetically really nice phone... My ringer stopped working, the signal through MetroPCS on the phone sucked. Plus had to buy an extra charger after 2weeks of using it because the charger started falling apart.",1
I bought 3 iphone 4s 16 gb ... 2 are works great ... but one of them doesnt charge well and the problem is not from the charger ... the problem from the phone entry slot . i deal with amazon and gave me 20 USD as a refund and im happy for it ... now I will fix my phone ... thanks,4
My iPhone 4S Unlocked was received on time and was packaged like a brand new phone. It was unlocked as advertised. I was able to activate it with my new SIM chip without any problems. It had to be setup like a new phone. We are very pleased and would recommend this phone.,5
Never again. Bought this phone went to go activate it to find out I purchased a stolen phone and my carrier wouldn't activate it. I had to bribe the kid $40 to finally activate it. I tried to get a credit . I got nothing but a headache. Very disappointed.,1
"Even though the description says this refurbed phone was unlocked, we wasted an hour in the Verizon store trying to get it activated. What a waste of time.",1
"Was a ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" item. I wanted to use it on T-Mobile which is on the GSM network. Phone is described as working on T-Mobile and ATT. It is also described to NOT work on Verizon. The label on the back of the phone indicates it is a Verizon Wireless phone.I'm not taking the chance of having compatibility issue so it will be returned.",1
A month after getting this phone the wifi just shut off and can not be turned back on...therefore anything I want to do on this phone has to run off my data plan.. It's terrible and I'm very unsatisfied with this product!!,1
"I bought this iPhone 4S white, certified refurbished by BuySPRY and Fulfilled by Amazon, and a week after I started to use it, the screen became wrong, stripped and then turn black. I am in Argentina, so I don't know what to do, because it doesn't work, but I have no where to claim for a change. I would like an answer for this. Thank you.",1
"Tried to activate with Verizon, they said it could not be activated on their network. I have to conclude it is not an unlocked phone, notwithstanding the product description.",1
"It completely failed. When I inserted the new SIM card, it did not work. I had specifically asked for an unblocked phone that I could use during my trip to Tabzania,and I had to buy a phone there instead. A total waste of money.",1
Phone delivered on time and in excellent condition. I was able to activate it completely on my own and it is working fine. A fifth star would have been merited except somewhat degraded battery performance. Overall I consider it a very good purchase.,4
i boutght two of this... one came in OK condition... The other one comes with scratches and with a battery that wont last 1 hour... i am very dissapointed.,1
"Got here a day early, however the battery would constantly act up, the phone would shut off and say it was dead, it over heated and lastly--it just stopped sending texts. Returning asap.",1
Won't stay charged and screen had a nice scratch in to plus chips off the bottom of the phone where it's been dropped a few times.. Supposed to be refurbished but all that was done was factory reset...,1
The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it was in good physical condition. The phone would not activate or even recognize a AT&T signal. Not unlocked and not useful. Sent back and gave up after reading endless other negative reviews. These used phone peddlers are definitely the bad apples in Amazons barrel.,2
The phone has issues with the text part it deletes texts after a bit and won't put up notifications when I do get texts its a big pos sorry I bought I don't recommend buying anything from the seller,1
"OK..Did not come with SIM card slot pin.Did not come with ""includes all original accessories"" as stated in the product description.The included charger is cheaply made.Has some scratches.",3
"iPhone looks new ,it works in my countryIt does not comes with complete accessories and original boxCharger adapter US standard not EUROPE, I have to buy Europe standard charger adapter",4
We bought this so we could use the TruLink for hearing aids. The iphone will not sync to the Starkey aid as it should. I expected better from Amazon. This lick was why we bought the phone.,1
The product was like brand new and has worked great since I first activated. I am very pleased with the product and it arrived ahead of schedule which makes it even better. Very pleased with my purchase.,5
"Not happy at all, I am returning the phone. It's not compatible with Verizon ! Waited a week for the phone to go to my store to activate and use and it's only compatible with ATT",1
"Originally, I was unsure about this phone as the reviews aren't great. However, my phone came in great condition and so far am not having problems with it.",5
Problem of battery or phone ??? Obligate to charge it 4 or 5 time a day and the battery indicate 80% one minute later it 30% and when you plug it one second indicate charge 60%,1
"Hello! I am not fully satisfied with this items. one of the phone Home button is difficult to operate. In addition to this any of these phone not complete set.I didn't get earphone(ear plug) for any of them. Do you think , it is acceptable?",3
"The appearance of the phone is excellent , like new. The battery life is good. It had a Verizon related sticker on the back but it is indeed unlocked. It is a GSM phone. I took it to Mexico to use there and got a SIM and number from Telcel without any problems. It works very well.",5
"Though the product is good but the battery worked pathetic. I had to charge the phone three times a day. If a phone is factory refurbished, then don't they check the battery quality? Anyway, I returned the product in a week.",1
Sometimes one can be a little skeptical when purchasing a refurbished iphone. I had 2 positive experience with iphone I bought from this company. The iphone has been working flawlessly.,5
"All things a go! I love it, it's just what I expected. Thanks! I upgraded from iPhone 3 to iPhone 4s. The iPhone 4s is way more advanced then my iPhone 3. I feel like I've moved up in technology phase. Can't wait to advance to the iPhone 5 or even the iPhone 6s.👍🏽📱📲",4
"Fast delivery, though one week of use battery not holding charge and now just completely DIED. Didn't come with all accessories as stated and cheap replacement charger. Returning",2
"The Betry of this phone is almost dead, I mean it gives maxi 3 hours similarly they said factory unlocked but it is not factory unlock it is At&t phone so I am don't need it I am gona send it back...",1
"I bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it. The phone came in perfect condition. The sim card slot is regular size not micro, which is what I needed. Otherwise I would have had to buy a micro sim kit. Very happy with my purchase.",5
"Wish I could leave negative stars, slow shipping despite having prime and phone won't even charge or stay powered on. My poor son was so disappointed. Horrible experience.",1
"The iPhone itself appeared to be near new. However, the sim tool and ear buds were missing, even though the copy clear states that all original accessories were included. Vendor will not provide.",2
"I love this phone. I think that, besides the functionality, I really like how this sturdy this phone is---with just the right amount of weight to it. If something happens to my phone, I will buy this model again.",5
I love it a lot! The iPhone 4/4S is my favorite designed Apple phone yet. I love everything about it despite not being able to upgrade passed IOS 9.3.,4
"Perfect. iPhone was unlocked, I took it in to AT&T, new sim card, 5 mins later everything was working 100%YES this was a verizon iphone! Verizon had apple unlock them, 4 & 4S in 2014. Just slip in a micro sim card, I tried my T-moble and moms Att... BOTH worked just fine.Very Happy",5
The phone works fine with my T-mobile sim card and looks new. However it is quite slow (and I'm not sure if I've just grown used to the speed of the newer versions) and sometimes the screen freezes.,3
"I am very angry.This phone is not Refurbished phone.The iphone's back has many hairline scratchesand Battery life is very short. Is only one-fifth of the normal.Setup iOS version is 9.0, so iphone speed is very slow.OMG purchase.",1
The phone did not switch on even after charging it for one hour...None of the buttons work....I don't understand how can a seller sell such kind of product....Must be really desperate for bad reviews...,1
The product arrived with no blemishes. I activated it on Tracfone and the sound quality was excellent. I would highly recommend this seller. No complaints with the product.,5
My auxiliary cord and headphones will not plug into my phone. Very bummed out. Can't workout with my phone or listen to good music with it. After a few days the microphone no longer works so people cannot hear me. Avoid this company at all costs.,1
"The phone didn't have any scratches and looked like a brand new. The phone arrived nicely packed in the box with screen protector installed, charging cable, and an apple charger. The phone recognized the SIM card from the foreign provider without any problems.",5
"Worst!!!Worst!!!Worst...this is not a new phone and it's unlocked AT&T, phone comes with improper packing normal cartron box,After 15 days usage phone charge has defected, now charger is not working, waste of money, do not recommended this seller, since the item is not what they described.",1
"Very disappointed, couldn't be used for Internet at all. Took it to local phone store and they said it was useless. A bad purchase. I won't make that mistake again",1
Never buy this item in TECHarvard. Received 4 used iPhones in absolutely awful condition. Some of them with used batteries and not original low quality parts.,1
A month after getting this phone the wifi just shut off and can not be turned back on...therefore anything I want to do on this phone has to run off my data plan.. It's terrible and I'm very unsatisfied with this product!!,1
"I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE, THE PHONE MET ALL MY NEEDS. IT WAS DELIVERED QUICKLY AND WORKED AS PROMISED, I'M GOING TO BUY ANOTHER FOR MY WIFE.",5
"Good afternoon amazon, the iphone was received in good physical conditions but with some marks, however the phone is desactivated and the screen indicates to conect it to a pc by using itunes, I tried to activate it through iTunes without success. The iphone is inoperative. Plase i hope you can help me so i can use the article i bought.",1
"Iphone arrived in perfect condition, looks absolutely brand new. Battery life is great and it seems that the phone has never been used. We activated on Tracfone using their BYOP sim card and had no issues.",5
Battery dies too prematurely compared to my store-bought iPhone 4 yrs ago. And one of the audio speakers does not work - it arrived this way. Would not buy from this dealer again.,2
Product was a gift for someone. Once they received the phone and attempted to use it the return window was over:( we charged the phone for first time use and determined the battery will not hold a charge and drained within a few hours with minimal use.,1
I write pretty good worried because last week received the cell phone to buy him but it does not work because it does not connect to the wireless network as hacerpara that we could change me,1
"Arrived quickly, had to buy it because my phone din't work on the Us networks, now this iPhone works both in the USA and in Holland, so definitely unlocked. Battery was my initial concern with buying a used phone but lasts a whole day with a lot of use and 2-3 days with less use so really happy. Definitely can recommend.",5
The title says it is unlocked. But acctually it is locked to verizon. What happened to Amazon? There are more and more liers now. I am really disappointed.,1
The phone looks great and was well packaged. At first I was concerned that the phone was not fully unlocked because it was a verizon phone but everything works great. I dont know why some customers had issues with this phone being an old verizon phone unless they just never tried putting a sim card in it but im satisfied with everything,5
The iphone 4S is good for what it is! Its slow works kinda of shakey meaning I could be trying to do one thing and it will go to a screen that I wasn't trying to get to. Extra hot when talking and definitely holds no charge if I talk on for 20-30 mins.,1
I don't know why everyone is dissing this phone mine came perfect and unlocked. It didn't have a single scratch. The only thing is when you buy older phones like this they're a little slow but besides that perfect.,5
"The mobile is Ok but in the description said that it is able to work with 4G, that is wrong. I'll kindly suggest to delete this point form the page description",3
I am very unhappy with this purchase. I've had to charge this phone at minimum twice a day and if you like to use apps than much more charging would be required.,2
I thought I was going to receive an UNLOCKED cell phone. It appears that it's not because I have been to 2 different phone stores and they can't get it working.,1
"Yeah, so don't buy this phone. It's not unlocked. These dudes are either incompetent, scamma-lamma-ding-donging us, or unable to articulate exactly what they think ""unlocked"" means.",1
The phone itself seemed fine. I wasn't able to tell if it was network-unlocked or not because the phone had an activation lock...definitely not something you expect from a certified refurbished phone.,2
"This was a gift for my wife and she is happy with it but. Everything works fine except for wi-fi, that is greyed out and not usable. Just google wi-fi issues on iPhone 4s and you will see what I mean. You make your own mind on this one",2
"iPhone arrived within 2 days in Excellent condition. I couldn't find the minor scratches mentioned in the description. Unlocked, as promised. Connected to T-Mobile as soon as I inserted my sim card. Activated phone and synced iTunes. I am very pleased with this purchase!",5
"Phone came in awesome condition with no scratches or dents in it. Battery life was amazing as well! I highly recommend you get this phone! This phone comes already with ios 9. Includes with- Refurbished Unlocked iPhone 4S with built in iCloud, Charging cable with plugThis was a good deal and no other price can beat this!",5
DO NOT BUY THIS IPHONE !I've had it for two weeks and is a piece of junk:-The audio does not work most of the time (especially when using headphones).-It does not connect to Wi-Fi at times.-Safari app crashes constantly.-Battery runs out quickly once it reaches 50 %. Do not buy it. Be smart and buy a new one. I am returning this piece of junk.,1
"Was supposed to be gsm unlocked phone, turns out it was for sprint. So it doesn't work for what i need, eventhough it stated it was for those networks in the description!!!!",1
Good evening I'm just receiving this iPhone and it's a Verizon iPhone and it's locked.. I need your help to return this item and buy the unlocked cell...,1
When I received this phone I was very impressed by how well the outside of the phone looked. It looked new. Unfortunately when I turned it on there were a few very faint but noticible yellow lines going down the screen. I returned it because I was nervous that this could become a major issue in the future.,2
"I actually am very happy with it, I got it for my little sister, who really wanted it.I was iffy at first but it works well and it looks great. Will be adding pictures later.",5
Phone was in amazing condition!! is unlocked but WILL NOT work with Verizon. It is a GSM phone which means only services like T-Mobile and AT&T will be able to activate it,3
"Worst!!!Worst!!!Worst...this is not a new phone and it's unlocked AT&T, phone comes with improper packing normal cartron box,After 15 days usage phone charge has defected, now charger is not working, waste of money, do not recommended this seller, since the item is not what they described.",1
"This product is sold as being unlocked and compatible with T Mobile. After going through the long process of resetting the phone using itunes, it will not work with the T Mobile SIM card. Useless!",1
"Just received my order for 2 unlocked GSM iPhone 4s & 2 Gorilla glass heavy duty cases. Both phones are Verizon CDMA carrier unlocked which is NOT AT&T or Team Mobile GSM unlocked! Also, 1 of the 2 Gorilla glass case came shattered inside the bubble wrap! Rrrrrrrr😡 Only good thing was package arrived in 24 hours only for me to have to return!",1
I love the phone it works great. But one slight problem. You sent the wrong kind of charger for it. I needed one for an iPhone 4s and you sent Ike for a 5s or newer,5
"My first review on Amazon after being a customer for over a decade. This is a total fraud, the charger is cheap off the street, as for apple packaging see the picture of attached box and the plastic sleeve it came in.",1
I took the phone to the Verizon Store in Lexington SC. They told me they could not activate the phone because it is not one of thier's. what do you suggest I do with this phone?,2
"It works! It doesn't hold a charge all day but it is ok for now. Not sure I would buy a refurbished again, especially from this seller due to the under charging.",3
Bought the phone but I need the previous owner itune login in order to use the iphone. Who can I contact to get this information or request a new one.,1
"On the amazon site, it listed it as a new phone rather than refurbished. Although I wouldn't expect a new phone that is so dated, it should have been listed as refurbished. The phone itself is fine and works well.",4
It is awesome! I have been wanting an iPhone 4s for a while now and finally got the money to buy it. The phone works 100%. You can add a carrier to it. It works just like any other iPhone too,5
Llego well but with the default screen calls chokes and reheated too when charging the battery would give me warranty then could not make the claim before because just a week ago I get the product because I am from Venezuela and slow as I can solve this problem?,1
"At the moment I have to say its ok,because I have not used it yet. I will activate it in Germany, and hope all goes well, if it is usable and works well,I will re post my review.M.St.",3
"This phone would not hold a charge. The phone's battery was partially melted and immediately had to buy a new battery. Apparently ""refurbished"" doesn't include a new battery. Very disappointed.",1
"Phone was not unlocked.I was referred to Apple. Apple said, 2 service techs, the phone was still locked to the Cloud. The prices quoted to have device unlocked in the $50 to $200 range. With no guarantee of success.Due to circumstances, the phone was a gift to someone out of the country, I am out the money.",1
Such a worst experience with this buy. This phone is not unlocked and battery is draining out like anything. Keep away from this dealer.I bought another 4s unlocked from lukki_lukki dealer and it's unlocked and in perfect shape.Returning this! !,1
"The battery cells must be dead or dying because it can't hold a charge for longer than an hour is being used moderately, or even for more than a few hours is left totally alone.",2
"There is definitely something wrong with the battery. When you charge it to full battery, in about 1 hour it says low battery. And. I think there is also a problem with the microphone. The most disappointing is that I ordered it as a gift, and it did not work properly.",2
The condition of the phone was near mint but there was something wrong with the battery. I would charge it to full battery and 1 hr later it will say low batt. So basically I need to have a outlet near me at all times..,2
"the iphone does not work, its not been 2 or 3 months I bought it and it does not work at all now.. gets switched off even with full battery, and screen shows loading sign with no other display...",1
"Many people said ""why are you buying 4s now?"", but I just had this need for an iPhone and purchased this. As the result, I am pretty happy about it. It works fine and the phone is brand new. It's delivered very quickly. 5 stars!",5
I bought this for my friend it's very goood and the price very nice to meCome with white box .. charge wall and USBAnd the shipping time 👌🏻 In the timeThank you ❤️,5
Product not working at all 45 days after purchase. This it the third refurbished product I have purchased and the third time I've been burned. No more.,1
"The Battery goes out in 10 minute with a full charge and the processor doesn't function right, it freezes and stuff. It worked okay for about 1 month.",1
"AS my first iPhone this is fantastic. Easy to use, exactly as described. It's smaller than my previous phones which I failed to research properly.HOWEVER I adore it. I would recommend BluTek to anyone. I bought 2 of these phones and they arrived promptly, in fabulous condition and I was very impressed.",5
"Battery life is pretty short... I'd say 3 hours when using the internet the whole time. If I don't use it much it will last through the day. Other than that, it was unlocked and everything seems to work",3
"I set the phone up with AT&T and the first call I made found that I cannot hear the call, the earphone portion is defective, after all that trouble now I have to return the phone for credit.",1
Not the newest phone but we put it in a case for our toddler and load it with kid games so its perfect (not SIM). Note didn't come in the original packing and had a non-OEM charger but all worked as promised.,5
"I am not satisfied. The product fall short of expectation. During telephone conversation the screen is scrambling. Also,sometimes I am unable to answer incoming calls because the ""slide to unlock"" feature is not working.",2
My iPhone 4S Unlocked was received on time and was packaged like a brand new phone. It was unlocked as advertised. I was able to activate it with my new SIM chip without any problems. It had to be setup like a new phone. We are very pleased and would recommend this phone.,5
Its was not unlocked I tried to put cricket wireless for it and it keep telling me the sim was invalid so I called Cricket Wireless and they told me to call Sprint and they told me it was not unlocked,1
"I'm trying to activate the phone and it's asking for a passcode? I bought as a gift for a first time phone for my nephew and apparently wasted my money. It didn't do this the first time I turned it on and now that I want to activate it, I can't do anything.",1
"the phone did not work, I took it to the apple store and it could not be repaired. I ended up trading it in on another 4s that did work .The phone would not pick up my wi fi or any wi fi. It still cost me another $199.00 but it made my little girl happy. It cost me $102.00 for your phone and 199.00 for the new one. No more refurbished for me.",1
Received the phone quickly. Everything worked very well except screen has a rattle noise when phone vibrates possibly from loose screen when refurbished. But works perfectly and not a big deal.,4
This phone will not stay connected to Wi-Fi. It is unusable and continually says no service. Very disappointing! We have tried rebooting the phone multiple times to no avail. We kept trying new things to make it work and we are now past the return date. What a waste! So frustrating.,1
"I love this phone. I think that, besides the functionality, I really like how this sturdy this phone is---with just the right amount of weight to it. If something happens to my phone, I will buy this model again.",5
"buy two phones refurbished and have received USED micas screen with marks and scratches from use of protective liners or cases , the metal bezel with many brands use too. that just hurts the just received in Venezuela if not immediately returned .",1
"The iPhone itself appeared to be near new. However, the sim tool and ear buds were missing, even though the copy clear states that all original accessories were included. Vendor will not provide.",2
"Wish I could leave negative stars, slow shipping despite having prime and phone won't even charge or stay powered on. My poor son was so disappointed. Horrible experience.",1
The phone did not switch on even after charging it for one hour...None of the buttons work....I don't understand how can a seller sell such kind of product....Must be really desperate for bad reviews...,1
Well this phone is breaking everyday like charger just broke left speaker don't work and when u talk on the phone I have to put it on speaker to hear something,2
I love it a lot! The iPhone 4/4S is my favorite designed Apple phone yet. I love everything about it despite not being able to upgrade passed IOS 9.3.,4
"Got here a day early, however the battery would constantly act up, the phone would shut off and say it was dead, it over heated and lastly--it just stopped sending texts. Returning asap.",1
Won't stay charged and screen had a nice scratch in to plus chips off the bottom of the phone where it's been dropped a few times.. Supposed to be refurbished but all that was done was factory reset...,1
The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it was in good physical condition. The phone would not activate or even recognize a AT&T signal. Not unlocked and not useful. Sent back and gave up after reading endless other negative reviews. These used phone peddlers are definitely the bad apples in Amazons barrel.,2
"After 5 full discharge and 5 full charge, I get just over 48 hours of stand-by time of battery life. According to the specifications I found on line, the stand-by time should be closer to 200 hours. This is the last time I purchase any refurbished product.",1
The good news is that it was an unlocked phone. And I was able to go to any carrier to start it up.The bad news is that it does not have a good battery life. The phone loses its charge very quickly!,2
I purchased this phone for my son on July 7 and on August 9 the phone conveniently died. It wouldn't charge at all and sits here as a tribute to my stupidity for listening to my teenage son who told me about purchasing a refurbished phone-- I know betterTHIS IS A SCAM! Do not buy this phone!,1
It's was somewhat okay being that it's refurbished. But I had expected be neater than it was.And I didn't expect the accessories to more than a charger. At least an earpiece added would not be bad.,3
"All things a go! I love it, it's just what I expected. Thanks! I upgraded from iPhone 3 to iPhone 4s. The iPhone 4s is way more advanced then my iPhone 3. I feel like I've moved up in technology phase. Can't wait to advance to the iPhone 5 or even the iPhone 6s.👍🏽📱📲",4
"Fast delivery, though one week of use battery not holding charge and now just completely DIED. Didn't come with all accessories as stated and cheap replacement charger. Returning",2
"In the publication you say the cellphone have all the originals accessories, you only send me the cellphone with a not original charger, you don't send me headphones. I need comunicate with the you.",2
The phone looks brand new! There are no scratches anywhere. The charger was even wrapped as the new ones! I've tried it with my at&t unlocked sim card and with an international sim card and it works perfectly so far.,5
"Perfect. iPhone was unlocked, I took it in to AT&T, new sim card, 5 mins later everything was working 100%YES this was a verizon iphone! Verizon had apple unlock them, 4 & 4S in 2014. Just slip in a micro sim card, I tried my T-moble and moms Att... BOTH worked just fine.Very Happy",5
"Well,...my iPhone came like new.....unlocked...on time and i am a happy customer...I would buy again from this company...thank you and good job...P.S...it was fairly priced too...",5
Is in perfect condition and is unlocked. all ports work well. It is just as fast as my other iPhone 4s was and can download the current iSO. only problem is that the phone gets really hot really quickly and the battery seems to run out a little faster than normal. comes in a fancy box with a clear top and a charger.,4
It came on time was happy about it but the charger was not the right one sad can't use it. The surface looks good no scratches but the speaker is not working well when making a call .,3
The telephone is in exquisite condition. Also everything is wonderful in regards to the performance of the telephone. Should the need occur in the future...there will not be any hesitation for me to purchase another telephone by using Amazon.com.,5
"Phone works ok but, i received a broken charger? it was completely disconnected from the piece and my home button kinda sticks but other then that it is ok find out tomorrow if cricket accepts it.",3
To my relief my phone worked fine. Ironically I could not activate on Verizon as a prepaid phone but it worked fine with Tracfone. I do not have any battery issues. This is just a backup phone anyway. It is not being used as a primary phone. I use it while I travel so I don't risk losing the more expensive version of this phone,5
Came on time loved it looks even bigger than expected...having turned it on as yet but I'm blown over thought it would have looked bad....only thing I wish it came with the headphone and manual that wud a have been a plus buuuuttttt love love love my new iPhone thanks amazon love yah.......,5
The iphone 4S was in pristine condition even though the description may not claim so. Also it was unlocked and I checked to see that it worked in AT&T. I sent the phone to India for use on the GSM network over there. I am very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended for the price. I paid $85 in July 2016.,5
Doesn't have enough space. I only have about 30 pictures and it won't let me take anymore. Also have to delete texts constantly. I haven't downloaded any apps.,2
The phone has issues with the text part it deletes texts after a bit and won't put up notifications when I do get texts its a big pos sorry I bought I don't recommend buying anything from the seller,1
"This phone worked great....until I went to purchase service from a no contract company, and they informed me that this phone was not on their list of unlocked phones. It's stuck on a Verizon Pre-Paid plan. My advice, keep looking.",1
"hi, i would like to contact you about the Apple iPhone 4S. I bought 2 iPhone and one of the two came damaged. The cell phone turns off evens with full battery. Please contact as soon as possible to solve the problem. Thank to you.Apple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked GSM - White (Certified Refurbished)",2
"Yeah, I still own an older iphone 4s, but it's a great deal for a quality product. Unfortunately, the camera cannot be silenced because this is an import model from Japan, but that info was not shared in the description. Also, the volume down button will not function; I have to use the CC menu.",3
"Not happy at all, I am returning the phone. It's not compatible with Verizon ! Waited a week for the phone to go to my store to activate and use and it's only compatible with ATT",1
"Originally, I was unsure about this phone as the reviews aren't great. However, my phone came in great condition and so far am not having problems with it.",5
Problem of battery or phone ??? Obligate to charge it 4 or 5 time a day and the battery indicate 80% one minute later it 30% and when you plug it one second indicate charge 60%,1
"Great condition, great phone. Normal battery. Once I was shocked by the 1 star reviews, finally I divided to give it a shot. I'm sure that I love this one. Only two cons:1, The OS is IOS 9, which is very difficult to be downgraded and kind of slow for iphone 4s. 2, The battery is not so good. I will replace the battery with a bigger capacity one.",5
"Phone was in good shape and working order. With a bit of help from T-mobile to remove previous user information all was well. However, after about 6 months it is completely unreliable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Battery life is atrocious. Total waste of money.",1
"The phone works ..not sure if its unlocked to work with any carrier , but its unlocked i currently have metro pcs and my sim card did not work in phone..i did not get headphones with the phone but overall the phone is in mint condition",3
Phones appear to be in good condition. Not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap. The USB cable came apart while charging the first time. Reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so I just went to find my own replacement Hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger....,3
"not buying! It does not work: does not play audio from videos or ring when they call, no charge! and I am now in Colombia and I can not return it! And Amazon is not responding!",1
Phone died and won't turn on after 92 days (90 day warranty). Very dissapointed! I contacted the seller and hoping they will still honor the warranty although I am 2 days over...I will post and update...,1
"Genuine new iphone 4s- packaging, charger , earphone not sure but the phone is absolutely new and works great. Great audio clarity, battery performance so far(10-15 days usage only so far). Is unlocked and work like charm with unlocked gsm sim. Great purchase very happy",5
"I bought 2 iphones..one was ok..the other was not unlocked, i sended it to my country and it doesn't work..so now what?i lost my 💰?..because i can't see any option to return the phone",1
"The phone was, contrary to my fears, actually unlocked! I was able to put in my SIM card immediately. The charger, however, was not made by Apple, and the end of the rubber cable was frayed and already disconnected.",4
This is not as advertised. Tried to buy and load a SIM card at a cell phone service provider in Vietnam. Could not get it to work . Do not buy this phone,1
"Was a ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" item. I wanted to use it on T-Mobile which is on the GSM network. Phone is described as working on T-Mobile and ATT. It is also described to NOT work on Verizon. The label on the back of the phone indicates it is a Verizon Wireless phone.I'm not taking the chance of having compatibility issue so it will be returned.",1
"Hello! I am not fully satisfied with this items. one of the phone Home button is difficult to operate. In addition to this any of these phone not complete set.I didn't get earphone(ear plug) for any of them. Do you think , it is acceptable?",3
"Even though the description says this refurbed phone was unlocked, we wasted an hour in the Verizon store trying to get it activated. What a waste of time.",1
"Though the product is good but the battery worked pathetic. I had to charge the phone three times a day. If a phone is factory refurbished, then don't they check the battery quality? Anyway, I returned the product in a week.",1
Sometimes one can be a little skeptical when purchasing a refurbished iphone. I had 2 positive experience with iphone I bought from this company. The iphone has been working flawlessly.,5
Hello! Acquire thisApple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished) product and the same presentaa problem with the handset (not olle ) what is the procedure to enforce the guarantee,3
The battery life is horrible. I changed it fully before leaving home. Within few hours the battery was close to 10 %. It was hardly used for 10 mins of call. This seems to useless. Hope to return the device.,1
We bought this so we could use the TruLink for hearing aids. The iphone will not sync to the Starkey aid as it should. I expected better from Amazon. This lick was why we bought the phone.,1
The product was like brand new and has worked great since I first activated. I am very pleased with the product and it arrived ahead of schedule which makes it even better. Very pleased with my purchase.,5
The phone works fine with my T-mobile sim card and looks new. However it is quite slow (and I'm not sure if I've just grown used to the speed of the newer versions) and sometimes the screen freezes.,3
"I am very angry.This phone is not Refurbished phone.The iphone's back has many hairline scratchesand Battery life is very short. Is only one-fifth of the normal.Setup iOS version is 9.0, so iphone speed is very slow.OMG purchase.",1
Was surprised that the volume on the phone is 1/2 as loud as my original phone purchased new 4 years ago. Bought this one as a gift and the ring is not very loud. Exterior had only a couple of minor scratches which was expected for a refurbished.,3
"I bought this iPhone 4S white, certified refurbished by BuySPRY and Fulfilled by Amazon, and a week after I started to use it, the screen became wrong, stripped and then turn black. I am in Argentina, so I don't know what to do, because it doesn't work, but I have no where to claim for a change. I would like an answer for this. Thank you.",1
"Tried to activate with Verizon, they said it could not be activated on their network. I have to conclude it is not an unlocked phone, notwithstanding the product description.",1
"It completely failed. When I inserted the new SIM card, it did not work. I had specifically asked for an unblocked phone that I could use during my trip to Tabzania,and I had to buy a phone there instead. A total waste of money.",1
Phone delivered on time and in excellent condition. I was able to activate it completely on my own and it is working fine. A fifth star would have been merited except somewhat degraded battery performance. Overall I consider it a very good purchase.,4
"It came exactly when they said it would and the phone looks brand new. So far, the only problem I've had with it is that it froze on me once, but other than that I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.",4
The phone stopped working after less than 30 days. I'm in Argentina and it's impossible to ship items from other countries in here. I guess it's a waste of time and money. Extremely dissapointed of my purchase and don't have any plans to shop again here.,1
"The Betry of this phone is almost dead, I mean it gives maxi 3 hours similarly they said factory unlocked but it is not factory unlock it is At&t phone so I am don't need it I am gona send it back...",1
"I bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it. The phone came in perfect condition. The sim card slot is regular size not micro, which is what I needed. Otherwise I would have had to buy a micro sim kit. Very happy with my purchase.",5
i boutght two of this... one came in OK condition... The other one comes with scratches and with a battery that wont last 1 hour... i am very dissapointed.,1
Came sooner than expected. First one stopped coming on (wouldn't load) after a year. Liked the phone so much bought another one. This one looks and works fine.,5
We ordered this factory refurbished phone! We missed the return date otherwise we would have returned it! It really never worked properly! We will never buy a refurbished phone again! It is a scam!,1
"iPhone looks new ,it works in my countryIt does not comes with complete accessories and original boxCharger adapter US standard not EUROPE, I have to buy Europe standard charger adapter",4
Never again. Bought this phone went to go activate it to find out I purchased a stolen phone and my carrier wouldn't activate it. I had to bribe the kid $40 to finally activate it. I tried to get a credit . I got nothing but a headache. Very disappointed.,1
"OMG what a great buy! This phone is in perfect condition. We were able to set it up without even contacting the carrier, just switched over the sim card. For a teenager wanting an iphone, this was a great investment/starter.",5
Phone is not unlocked as described. It is a Verizon phone. Waited a long time for this phone as I live in Central America and can't return it. What a waste of time and money.,1
"The phone was the correct color and in perfect condition. I had to return it because after taking it to multiple carriers...TMobile, Verizon, and Sprint no one would support it on their network. Evidently unlocked 4s's have this issue.",3
"After about three weeks of use, I noticed the battery running out very quickly. Now, sometimes it goes from 68% to dead instantaneously, and sometimes it will stay on 1% for hours.I know it was refurbished, but I didn't expect the battery to fail that quickly. I'm disappointed, to say the least, and the phone is no longer eligible for return.",2
Lasted for around 27 days now it won't hold a charge. I loved it when it first game updated it to ios 9.1.2 and it screwed me over not even a month what it. I don't even know what to do.EDIT: Product works. It was just the power brick that came with it. It no longer works. I do have another power brick and the phone does hold a charge.,5
"Although this did not come with original accessories as stated, knock off charger and no headphones which were include in the original accessories of the iphone 4, the phone seems to work fine for my teenager, the exterior is in excellent shape. Will update when I take it to our carrier.",3
"So it's been a month since I bought this product for my mom. So far so good, I mean it is an iPhone 4S, you can't really set your expectations too high. Yes, when I received the phone there was a sticker in the back that said that the carrier was Verizon. However, I took it to my Metro store and there was NO PROBLEM connecting it to this carrier.",5
In pristine condition. I went to the Apple Store and they confirmed that it was unblocked. We leave for South Africa and the Maldives for 7 weeks and I will buy a local SIM card. Then I will know for sure if it works.,5
"When I bought this phone i noticed how the phone didnt quite match the description. When i got the phone and went to get it activated it came up stolen. I am extremely disappointed because the phone looked super clean with no scatches, basically it was new.",1
"I've been impressed with processing speed, quality build and ease of use. Screen is small by today's standards but very clear. Touch screen is very precise. Runs OS 8 without problems.",5
What I was looking for was a phone with a few scratches and/or scuffs... What I received was a brand new iphone 4s no scratches no scuffs everything in working order...Thank you!!!!!,5
This phone was exactly what I wanted and it worked well. I dropped it and shattered the face shortly after owning it but was able to pick up an IPhone 5.,5
"Absolute amazing transaction, got the phone with not a single scratch on it, in fact it looked brand new to me. Thanks for the phone and thanks so much for the smooth transaction.",5
For the first month it operated like new and then the product became defective. I sent it to apple to get it fixed and They could not do anything for it. It is a complete and utter waste of my $399. I am highly upset but there is nothing i can do about it.,1
"Late response: this seller offered me a fantastic deal on a great device. The benefit to my review is 2 years later and its still an awesome value. I'm using it to write the review- the device arrived as said, in better condition then was listed (great-listed as good) and everything works as well as lasted. Throughly satisfied. Thank you!",5
You gave me the wrong goods.You give me an iphone4 no the iphone4s that i need .And all mobile phone accessories not genuine.I also found that Mobile Charger is bad.,1
"I bought iphone 4s like new at&t for $370, but when I got the item it's only iphone 4 and there's lots of scracth in the back and side metal.It's not worth for the price.",1
I bought this for my daughter and she is very pleased with it and all the different things it does. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Would do business with these people again.,5
The phone had some clear marks of wearing on the front and back of the phone even thought it was marked as used like new. It also was missing the wall plug when it stated that it had all the accesories.,3
"The phone is good just that when i received it, the flashlight wasn't working but i got a partial refund back. Other than that he phone is hundred percent good.",4
Perfect!!!!! Thank you for the fast delivery. Beautiful condition. I lost my iPhone and bought this one. Felt weird about buying it online but it exceeded expectations. Thanks!,5
Excellent product that does not need much descriptions. Properly unlocked. Works excellent with Colombian Phone service providers. Apple is the best choice in smartphones for me.,5
"Overall pretty good.The iphone 4s looks very new, but the battery is not durable and Packaging unsealed.The factory date is October 2011.My iPhone headset can not answer or hang up a call, only to play or pause music. It has no volume control. I think it's not an iphone headset, but an ipod headphones.",5
In the description it stated that it was like new almost flawless and that it didnt have any problems. When i got it and went to activate it with AT&T they said it had water damage.,1
"I was very well satisfied by this product. Not only did it arrive days before it was expected, but it came with THIRTEEN different screen protectors. The iphone was only very minimally scratched, little enough to be mistaken for new. I was very impressed",5
THE SELLER AND I ARE TRYING TO WORK OUT THE PROBLEMS WITH THIS PHONE. THE PHONE'S BATTERY WON'T HOLD A CHARGE TO BE A BRAND NEW PHONE. THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING TO WORK WITH ME TO GET IT FIXED. WE BELIEVE IT'S A DEFECTIVE BATTERY FROM APPLE.,3
Ordered it Monday its now Wednesday and i received my phone fast. It looks and feel great the description was not a lie it was brand new not even opened came in the original box :) definitely impress with this seller will definitely order in the future :),5
Phone came quickly and I was able to transfer all my content and service over to it without a problem. This was an upgrade for me from a 3g and the difference is fantastic.,5
"everything said about the phone was right, but the battery is damage and need replace, base on the diagnostic made to the phone by Apple store I went to..",3
"I rejected getting an iPhone for years, and if you're reading this, you probably have too. I had 3 Blackberries over the course of 4 years, and all of the minor flaws I found with those phones are non-existent with this phone.Really, it hasn't changed my life or anything, but I do wish I'd done this sooner. Especially for the camera.",5
Arrived with more wear and tear than described. Definitely had been used and not protected well. Power button working after repeated attempts. Volume button sticks.,2
"according to the model number, I recieved and Iphone 4 and not 4s. The model number is A1332, not A1387 as specified. I am not satisfied with this purchase.",2
"I've had this phone for about a year and a half at this point, and there are no problems with the phone itself. Obviously older generations of the iPhone run a little slower with the new OS, but that is certainly not the seller's fault. I'll probably keep this phone for at least another 6 months.",5
Got it for the memory. intended to use as a i pod replacement for auto sound system. couldn't get it to cooperate the playback of music was not good quality either,2
Awesome. I've never bought a phone on Amazon and I was very skeptical. I broke my phone and needed a back up phone until I was eligible for an upgrade. I received the phone and it was just as the description said. I would definitely recommend this seller. Fast shipment too!!!,5
very nice iphone .very good quality as write in description ..came early then expected..very good coustmer services .i suggest this dealer(greensqd) to everyone ..nice job . thank you very much .,5
"something was clearly wrong with the phone, it would not hold a charge. after buying a new battery and installing the next day the phone the screen went blank and has not worked since. I have since had to purchase another phone. Not Happy!",1
Works great. Only reason I bought it was I love the iPhone 4s and my first one just didn't have enough memory for all of my music so I bought this one with double the GB of memory. Still use my old one for music when I just want to listen to music and am using my other one in rooms on bluetooth when I want this one nearby and handy to answer.,5
"The phone i bought and receive was stolen. When i was going to activate the phone, the phone was reported stolen therefore i couldn't activate the phone",1
"I've been impressed with processing speed, quality build and ease of use. Screen is small by today's standards but very clear. Touch screen is very precise. Runs OS 8 without problems.",5
"When I bought this phone i noticed how the phone didnt quite match the description. When i got the phone and went to get it activated it came up stolen. I am extremely disappointed because the phone looked super clean with no scatches, basically it was new.",1
"When I received the phone the wireless didn't work. Thought that after I put service in the phone that it would work. Apple users believe in, ""It just works.""This didn't.",1
We took it to T-Mobil for activation and they could not So we made an appointment with Applein Milwaukee and they could not get it to work. They checked it out with instruments and saidit was shot. We returned it to amazon for credit and bought new from Apple.,1
Battery drains out in 30 mins. I have charged this to 100% multiple times and it drains out every time in 30 mins. I don't understand how is this certified refurbished. This is the basic simplest thing and if this is not checked and verified how can they be sold as certified refurbished?,1
"The phone is OK, however the charger does not work and the battery doe not last for last for 24hrs even when it's fully charged. Unable to contact the seller",3
"hate it,,stay away...as soon as we activated this phone it didn't work and the people at the local ATT store said that this happens all the time with refurbished phones, it was a major waste of time and I hope to return asap",1
The phone was fine but the charger cable was old and did not work. Which meant that I had to purchase a new one in order to even check out the phone. : (,3
"I am very happy with this phone. I've had it for a month now. It works just fine, takes great pictures, was shipped promptly and packaged well. I will buy again from this seller.",5
"The phone does not charge. And there a noticeable mark in the middle of the screen. I don't know what they mean by ""Certified referbished"" but this phone was defiantly not even looked at before it was shipped. Super dissaponted, will be returning for a refund.",1
The phone has worked great so far and was like new. There were a couple scratches on the back but I use a protective case for the phone and never see them. Well worth it when you consider the new phone will be double the cost. Also offers improved performance over the 4s.,5
The description said it was unlocked but its an at&t phone and can not be used else where. When i recived it the sceen cover was cut around the home button. It wasnt worth the money,1
"Happy, happy, happy!! We needed to replace our daughter's iphone as she uses it to monitor her diabetes. When I contacted the seller about receiving it sooner, I think they shipped it before responding!! It's in great shape and working like a charm. I will definately look for this seller again!!!!",5
"It lasted about a month, then it stopped working. The battery wouldn't hold a charge, then it wouldn't charge at all. Went to a repair place and they said the motherboard was bad. Big mistake! Won't ever buy from Amazon again.",1
"The phone was meant to be used overseas in Bangkok. And after its final arrival recently, it is not working properly. The icloud back is not completing and is hanging.",2
I did like the product and was all set too purchase another until I found out none of my callers could hear me and the phone kept losing my network connection to my Sim card and i missed countless calls. Other than that great phone i guess. Thanks for swift response for the refund.,1
THE BATERY DIDN'T WORK. WITH FULL CHARGE IT ONLY LAST 5 MINUTES. VERY DISAPPOINTED.NEVER EVER WILL BUY SOMETING WITH THE MESSAGE CERTIFIED REFURBISHED. IT'S A LIE.,1
"This phone immediately had issues.- Data was slow everywhere-Phone froze, was stuck in a white screen. Even after restarting and trying other recommended remedies.-Luckily I got a full refund, ordered from the same seller. New Iphone 5 looked and worked great.",1
"I got problems with the battery and need to change it, the seller never said it was first bought in china therefore i was not able to be part of the apple program",2
"The phone arrives with some problems. The battery hadn't durability nore than 1 hour since the bigining ant the flash doesn't work as well.I have a friend in USA now with the device, How can we procede?Boris",2
It works good but i had problema connecting it to Metro PCS but i did connect it it just need to call someone from metro and do something else idk what they did but it worked good.,4
"for 200 dollars you can have this Iphone 5 re-furbished, that runs the latest Apple software and does EXACTLY the same tricks as the Iphone 7 for 800 bucks......why pay more ? Im DELIGHTED with this official certified Apple model .",5
I was really excited when I received the phone but very disappointed because the battery just last few minutes. Dont you check this devices before to go for sell?,1
"This product was not working good, because battery not working properly ( suddenly switch and also batter only one hour working)and also too much heat this phone",1
"Described as refurbished, but the battery won't hold any charge. The volume didn't work right and it definitely didn't look like new!Very disappointing and frustrating. I just wasted my time and I won't ever buy here again !",2
"I've bought this Apple iPhone 5 in March this year. It worked in the beginning well, but it stop charging two months ago. This was supposed to be a certified iphone. That wasn't fair.",1
Not impressed I brought this while I was in America it worked fine brought it home to New Zealand knowing it was an UNLOCKED phone and it doesn't even work!!!! Unlocked means works anywhere and since I'm past the return date they won't let me return it even though they fake advertised and lied!,1
"I love the phone and while there are no technological issues, the battery is VERY short for what an Iphone should be (about 4 hours with average usage). It has improved over time, but still no where near it should be. Also, this phone ONLY came with a wall charger, no car charger or headphones as advertised.",3
This was supposed to be a certified refurbished and what I got was a phone that would not hold a charge for more than an hour and now it will not even charge up.. would not buy again.,1
"I was not going to by this phone brand new so, the next best option was refurbished and honestly, it's wonderful. My brother desperately wanted an iPhone and this one was excellent.",5
"Gift for my grandson. Sorry I can't reach him for comment. His line is always busy,,,,teenager.He is very satisfied with the phone. It is perfect and he is convinced it is a new phone. Thank you very much.",5
I had to buy a new battery for it.Then the phone got stolen 3 days later.So now I'm buying a new iPhone 5s 32gb not going to take a chance on a used phone again.,3
The worst order i have ever ordered...it says unlocked in the info but when i used a regular sim...it says unlocking required...i would give it a zero rating,1
"Although the description very clearly indicates you would be receiving an ""unlocked"" iPhone, this is not the case. It was clearly locked and unusable with T-Moble. Beware, sometimes things are too good to be true...",1
This product has not been fully refurbished as claimed by the seller. The battery will not hold a charge or charge now. after being placed on the charger all night it will say 100% for a mi ute then drop immediately to below 50%.,1
I was skeptical...read some bad comments about refurbished I-Phone...but this phone turns out GREAT.Exactly as we expected and works fine. Save lots of money. It looks just like NEW. The delivery is much faster than we expected.,5
"The phone is very difficult to charge, it does not recognize when the charging cord is plugged in. My husband and have several Iphones and have no problems with any of the others charging.I have to plug and unplug 20 to 25 times before it will respond to the cord being attached.",2
The earpiece doesn't work when on a call. I have to put it on speaker phone to hear the other side of the line. The screen seems to be falling off the front of the phone and I have to squeeze it back several times a day,2
The phone worked for several months then became unresponsive after an apple update. A trip to the Apple Store revealed that the phone was not a authentic iPhone but a knockoff using a mix of apple and non-Apple parts. Advise caution here.,1
"Poor Battery Life it is ridiculous to go from 90% to 12% in 40 minutes using waZe or google maps, charger wont charge correctly and gps has trouble working i dont know yet how to react to this because i have a plane leaving to vermont on the 8th of december. Where should I make the product return",1
"I love the phone so far! No complaints. Looks brand new. Oddly, my package did come in a Verizon phone box which had me worried... but once I put my SIM card in the phone WAS unlocked like stated.",5
"Hello, I recently bought this article and the charger plug comes with problems, no charge. I tried different cables and has the same problem. Amazon said it is certified refurbished but seems not to be so.",1
"Good afternoon I am writing to you in order to communicate the iPhone 5 team acquired introduces operational failures such as the handset and telephone as well as the volume and shutdown control buttons, by what I do not agree with the acquisition of the same, I position a response on your part to handle the problem",1
The worst! I bought this phone for my mom thinkig it was certified refurbished and we would have no issues. The phone worked for 1 week and then the screen turned black and white with stripes and my mom could not read anything and the phone became useless. Returned the phone 5 days ago and have not yet received a refund. What a waste of time!,1
So small and bulky. I own and love other apple products but not that commited to the cause. I returned it and bough a Samsung galaxy. I wanted a bigger screen. Not sure if my comment still counts.,3
Supposed to be unlocked and it wasn't. I bought a SIM card with the phone didn't recognized the SIM card and I went to the same provider as the SIM card and didn't work either with other SIM card. Not satisfied with the purchase.,1
DearI have problems with the purchased equipmentwith 100% charged battery does not last or 3 hours of useand sometimes indicates a full battery charge being dischargedas we do to fix it?regards,2
The phone worked the first day and then it never worked again it just keeps crashing I'm just going to buy my apple products from apple so I don't have to hassle with waiting for a refund or trying to get a replacement,1
This phone has been in use less than a week and it is going crazy malfunctioning and it keeps doing things like its possessed. Probably will end up returning.,1
"Phone arrived well packaged, but I was never able to register it with tracfone. Everything else worked, but I could not receive calls, even after several hours on the phone/online help with both apple and tracfone, so I had to send the phone back.",4
"I am a first time iphone user. The phone is great, I see why they are so popular. I am concerned about battery life though. It seems to get low with moderate use in just a half day. I don't know if this is normal or my ""new"" battery is weak..",3
The phone is exactly as described although the battery life of the phone is not great. I suggest the company replace the battery before selling it or get a better battery carrier (if they already replace the battery before selling) all in all I'm very pleased with my purchase.,4
I bought my daughter this phone Ann now if doesn't work she's had it a couple week when them took it the Apple store for them st stay she bought a wrong phone. It can't be fixed. Thanks for reining her specilday,1
The battery is extremely short lived. It will show over 50% charged and then die. I have to almost constantly have this charging. I ran into issues getting my carriers cellular network. Not worth it for the price that was paid for a refurbished phone,1
The phone itself works pretty well however when making phone calls I can't hear the other party. Kind of disappointing that I can't really make calls due to this problem,3
The phone would not hold a charge :(. It would go from 100% charged to 13% in a matter of 10 minutes...... This is my very first time dealing with Amazon and I must say I am very Unsatisfied :(,1
"this phone hasnt been working properly from i got it, and now it does work at all...i have taken it to several shops and no one seems to be able to help. worst by ever!!!",1
"Not unlocked. Description clearly states that it is an unlocked phone, however it is very much locked. Need to register with AT&T before using....Thankfully Amazon is great with returns.",1
Few of the buttons were not working. I had to give the gift to my brother. He took to india so now I can't return also.Bad experience on this product. Never going to order iphone from amazon.,1
"Phone arrived with a small but noticiable scratch on the screen. Also, first day out of the box the phone fell off my nightstand (2' fall) shattering the screen. Lastly, 1 star only because it makes you put something...",1
Battery sucks ass. Always dies ! Doesn't hold a charge . Two three months later and the home bottom doesn't work ! Exists out of apps 😭😭 $200 down the drain .....,1
DearI have problems with the purchased equipmentwith 100% charged battery does not last or 3 hours of useand sometimes indicates a full battery charge being dischargedas we do to fix it?regards,2
Phone does not hold own charge. Has to be on charger 90% of the time. Will cost over $100 to replace battery. Horrible! Had to rate before could write review,1
"Hello, I recently bought this article and the charger plug comes with problems, no charge. I tried different cables and has the same problem. Amazon said it is certified refurbished but seems not to be so.",1
It didn't come with a charger so I had to go buy that.This is a new phone for me because I've never had iPhone.No instructions as how to set up.I would buy from this dealer again but I'll always ask more guestions.,4
The phone itself works pretty well however when making phone calls I can't hear the other party. Kind of disappointing that I can't really make calls due to this problem,3
The earpiece doesn't work when on a call. I have to put it on speaker phone to hear the other side of the line. The screen seems to be falling off the front of the phone and I have to squeeze it back several times a day,2
"Phone works fine, but the battery isn't great. Just have to keep a charger on you. Other than that, you would never know this was a refurbished phone.I feel like it is slightly overpriced for just being a 5 and being refurbished. I should have bought the 5S new for about 20$ more.",3
The phone worked for several months then became unresponsive after an apple update. A trip to the Apple Store revealed that the phone was not a authentic iPhone but a knockoff using a mix of apple and non-Apple parts. Advise caution here.,1
"I was very impressed with the phone I purchased. We have had no issues with the phone, and it looked brand new. I would use this seller again. It arrived on time, and was packaged very well. Im surprised you could get a phone in this condition for so cheap.",5

"This is our 2nd iPhone 5 from this seller. The first phone came with almost no battery life, but was pleasantly returned & replaced. The replacement phone has more limited battery life than I would like, but not nearly as bad as the original.",4
The phone is exactly as described although the battery life of the phone is not great. I suggest the company replace the battery before selling it or get a better battery carrier (if they already replace the battery before selling) all in all I'm very pleased with my purchase.,4
"DONT BUY IT keep you time ""Refurbished NEW "" UFFF yea people rigth about the battery only 1 hour hold battery 100% to 0 WATH what is tha No good for the price 200$ Naaa is used scratch dent dirty Naaa Of course I return",1
"The phone tends to completely shut off when its battery life is anywhere from 50% to 5%, and is not covered by Apple warranty meaning the cost to repair its battery by the manufacturers is priced around 200 dollars. Not really worth the money, if you're looking for a cheap refurbish then the iPhone 5s might be better well suited.",2
"Phone is fine but TMobile reduced band width for i5 unlocked phones resulting in no 4G data access in our area , display ""E"" according to my grandaughter.",5
"Really bad iphone. The screen should be white and this is YELLOW! The battery is terrible and the product said was NEW and is NOT NEW AT ALL! THE WORSE PRODUCT I HAVE BOUGHT EVER! And the phone has a lot of crashes, of course is not new, you lied to your customers! I want my money back!",1
It was supposed to be new and unlocked but received in an open box with not instructions book and this is to use only with Sprint. Why they tell lies and make us lose time buying things we have to return?,1
"Apple iPhone 5 16GB - Desbloqueado - Negro (reacondicionado certificado)Vendido por: RAZAThis iphone not come completely miss your accessory like taco, only wine I need cable and check it as such in its operation",1
The Apple IPhone 5 didn't meet my expectations it's keep on going off and on.The iPhone is always warm.I thought it's a new IPhone 5.I don't like this phone it's given me so many problems right now.The Watch is ok Bt d IPhone 5 is not in good condition. The charger can't recharge d IPhone 5,1
The phone is almost new in the outside and functions perfectly. The only drawback on my side is that the battery is very weak but of course I couldn't expect everything on the phone to be perfect for half its price so overall I am very happy with my Iphone :-),5
The battery only lasted 2 hours at first then went to a few min. Couldn't send back because I was past the return time. If this was refurbished the battery should have been checked. And if not replaced then a mention in the ad . I am in Africa and couldn't get it back in time.,1

I would recommend this to anyone. I got the white iPhone 5 and it's amazing for a certified refurbished phone. I don't usually write reviews but this product is so good I had to,5
Phone was in poor condition... The Screen Had several scratches.. It was scuffed... The battery could hold a charge.. It went from 100% to 20% in less than 30min.... So I ended up paying $120 for new battery & screen and other cosmetics...,1
The phone would not hold a charge :(. It would go from 100% charged to 13% in a matter of 10 minutes...... This is my very first time dealing with Amazon and I must say I am very Unsatisfied :(,1

"Back camera doesn't work. I bought the cellphone to bring it out of the country as a gift and the camera doesn't work. Now It's too late to return. Embarrassing experience. Don't waste your time here. The cellphone also doesn't come inside an Apple box, no headphones nor original Apple charger.",1

"This unlocked iPhone 5 that I bought is a really nice iPhone, I'm happy I decided to upgrade my phone. Hopefully the next person that orders one gets a good battery because the one that was in my iPhone 5 was shot so now I have ordered a replacement battery.",5
"The battery will not charge only had it for 2 days. I let it charge for 8 hours before using it and getting sim card .The phone is scratch free works well is the downside is the charger, and the focus is out of whack on the back camera. Also iPhone 5 batteries majority were recalled so it'll cost a pretty penny to get a new one .",2
The phone was in great condition turned on and work in initially as expected but then again glitches turn off without any kind of warning however it was returned it easily without any kind of problem which I believe is a plus for the vendor so I rated it at least a 4 star,4
"The camera is blurry when trying to take pictures. Even wiping the lense doesn't help, so I figured maybe the problem is on the inner part, instead of the outer. The front camera is fine.",3
"Got the package and was surprised that the iphone had no scratches. It really looked new! The phone plan set up was virtually effortless; it was very easy, and all of the functions were exceptional. I am satisfied with this purchase.",5
"I received the phone and placed it on charge. After it was fully charged, it started shutting down. It has been doing that very frequently. I have to continue turning it back on.",1
You sold me a phone with a dead battery in it an iPhone 5 that I spent over $200 on the product was for an autistic teenager now after I get his arm fixed from him doing a massive fit because the battery only last an hour at a f****** time I will make sure you get it back are we clear on this thank you,1
The phone would not hold a charge. We charged all night and within two hours it would die after unplugging. Twice it went dead with over 40% battery life. Returned after one day.,1
"Easy to move to new AT&T non contract account. Charger wasn't iphone brand but works great. We read bad reviews on this refurbished phone, but phone exceeded our expectations.",5

"Phone had bad phone speaker, issues with the battery life indicater (either has full battery or 1%, nothing in between). Seller offered a refund/replacement and was cool, I just couldn't be without a phone for 2-4 weeks.",2
I didn't check when it arrived and I send them to India .one is working fine but other is asking for PIN number .Not able to use that phone.what to do.,1
"This unlocked iPhone 5 that I bought is a really nice iPhone, I'm happy I decided to upgrade my phone. Hopefully the next person that orders one gets a good battery because the one that was in my iPhone 5 was shot so now I have ordered a replacement battery.",5
"Everything was great except the camera shutter is hard wired to never be silenced. It is a Japanese phone so it will always have a shutter noise with every photo taken, even with screenshots and in other apps. Personally this annoys me to no end.",1
"cant make calls without loud static in the background, problem with the mic on the dock connector that used during calls, can only hear calls on speaker",2
The iPhone itself was in excellent condition but the battery is just no worth the purchase even when fully charged the phone can barely last 2 hours and shuts off by itself even when it's nowhere mead dead. I STRONGLY WOULD ADVISE YOU TO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND ANOTHER 60+ to replace the battery.,1
"This phone purchase has been most acceptable and has worked perfectly since day one. Thrilled to have it, have GSM network and aboslutely no problems! Like brand new, would buy again from this seller if needed. Thank you so much, my daughter is thrilled with her upgrade.",5
"The iPhone itself is amazing, but the battery does not last half a day. I can't trust it to be available if needed in an emergency due to battery life. I did some checking and it turned out the battery had over 700 recharge cycles, which means the phone had been used for over two years. If possible, do not buy refurbished.",3
Product is not function properly. Ringtone was not loud and could not hear anyone on speaker. Other minor issues. Sent phone backk to Amazon for refund.,2
"The iPhone was clear and in good shape as described by the seller. However, the power button on the iPhone was kinda hard and difficult to use. It doesn't go off at first press, you have to hold it down for few seconds to lock screen. Aside that it's in good shape and works just fine.",4
It did not work. It would not keep a password. I changed my apple password 6 times. I took the phone to tmobile they couldn't figure it out they told me to take it to apple. They couldn't get it to remember a password either. I sent back last Monday.,1
Good phone. No problems with appearance or operation. I had to replace the battery within a few months. Mildly inconvenient but not expensive or a big deal really. I felt I received a good value.,4
Phone does not work. The internal speaker is defective. only speaker phone works for hearing phone calls. AlsoSent with charger for an iPhone 4. So can not charge with it. Probably just spend for a repair after the time invested in reinstalling everything.,1
"Don't buy this iPhone, the battery doesn't work well and I have to charge the phone every hour, the iPhone also works very slow , I really really don't recommend you to buy this iPhone, I don't wanna give this post a star but I have to, so I can share my experience I had with this iPhone",1
It said comparable to AT&T but I received a Verizon Apple iPhone. And it keeps dying at random times first time my phone was at 30% yesterday it was 52% nor today at 40%.,1
"I was scheptical about ordering this due to the bad reviews, but I thought I would give it a try. Although the phone arrived in record time and looks brand new, the battery only holds a charge for about 2 hours, and dies at 40%. Seller was no help. I am returning, but will give them another shot. I'll update when the second one arrives.",2
"The battery is useless, I have to almost always have it on a charger and it doesn't qualify for the free swap out. The mic that a phone call and snapchat use doesn't work, and it has a horrible time picking up Wifi. This was good in a pinch, but I wish I'd saved my money up and bought one from Apple.",2
I received a phone that was already activated and locked so i had to wait an extra week and a half for a new phone. The second time around everything was perfect as far as I can tell.,4
"We ordered two phones, recovered them yesterday. One is fine thus far, mine you can't hear out of and people can't hear you and if you or they can it echoes.",2
I love my new refurbished Iphone 5s!!! I believe I got a really good deal from Amazon. My phone was in great condition when I received it. It didn't come with the original charger or base but other than that I haven't had any problems so far! 👍🏽,5
"This phone was derived like new, could not see the difference between a new phone and this one. I have been using it for more than 6 months now and I have no complains.",5
"The phone was sent to me with a faulty battery. The battery drained in less than an hour, so I had to take it to the Apple Store fo the battery to be replaced. So ended up paying additional money to fix a certified refurbished phone!",1
This product are not certified. Mine came with a pink shadow in the back light. I don't have time to return it because I need to send it overseas today. Bad product,1
it sucks and i will never buy a phone on amazon again it freeze a lot it doesn't s work you can hear it was ringing. I do not recommend it this person.,1
"Battery is faulty. Dealfinder was great at communicating, and did offer me the 30 day return option, but I had waited so long to get the phone that I've decided to purchase a replacement battery and replace it on my own. Phone works great besides the bad battery.",4
"The phone was supposed to be unlocked, but it wasn't. Only accepted either Att SIM card or T mobile. Battery lasted 4 hours with no use even less if In use. I would never recommend a used phone. Just save yourself time and money buy new",1
"This is a replacement and upgrade to a previous version. The price was affordable and given my past experience as a iPhone holder, as well as iPhone's sterling track record, I know I'd get good mileage from this item. I'm very happy with my purchase.",4
"Nice phone 🤔 Only thing I dislike is the first two days I had it it died before it hit 0 % 😑 , after that it haven't done that . And it's now holding a charge 😛",5
said it was factory refurbished the battery will not hold a charge I had already installed a glass screen protector which cost $40 and didn't want to spend another 40.00 on another screen protector so I had battery replaced by Apple. Not happy,1
The phone we received had problems from the beginning. Finally took it in to an Apple store and they verified that it wasn't an Apple phone. Buyer beware.,1
The phone was in great condition turned on and work in initially as expected but then again glitches turn off without any kind of warning however it was returned it easily without any kind of problem which I believe is a plus for the vendor so I rated it at least a 4 star,4
I bought this phone for my husband to replace an old iphone 4 with a cracked lens. Needless to say...he loves his new phone. It arrived and was just as advertised. Screen looks great and phone works great. He has had it now for several weeks and will not part with it. I will be purchasing from this vendor again. THANK YOU!,5
I bought this in black for my 14 year old. We use the Wal-Mart family mobile plan and so far she says everything works perfectly. She has had this phone for about a week now.,4
"Like the design and features of the iPhone 5. I purchased a refurb model that was not on the battery recall list, but clearly has serious battery life issues. I am returning it - hooray for Amazon's return policy - and will purchase a new one from a different Amazon vendor.",2
I would recommend this to anyone. I got the white iPhone 5 and it's amazing for a certified refurbished phone. I don't usually write reviews but this product is so good I had to,5
Phone says it's unlocked will only work on wifi the phone is a version phone and will not sync with my AT&T plan. Can only make calls without wifi. On description it did not say what company phone is from,1
This phone is great. The small annoyances of the 4S are gone with the 5. And buying refurbished is even better. A practically new phone for half the price? SOLD!,5
"Phone came with 0% battery. Took hours to charge and when 100% charged, it took 10 mins to drain the battery to 50%. Phone shutdown occasionally. I also noticed LCD defect while pressing the screen. Screen also flickered a lot. Phone was returned in less than 24 HR . Very bad job by the vendor",1
came to me with the home button broken and had many problems with trying to charge the phone fixed that 30$ later and has now just broke after 4 months of use. Was not dropped or treated badly in anyway,1
"Phone looked great but when I tried to activate the SIM card it wouldn't take any card I put in it. Tried three different carriers, the return was pretty smooth.",2
The charger that came with the phone is not the original charger and my phone has completely stopped charging. I need some form of compensation or an original charger.,1
"Really bad iphone. The screen should be white and this is YELLOW! The battery is terrible and the product said was NEW and is NOT NEW AT ALL! THE WORSE PRODUCT I HAVE BOUGHT EVER! And the phone has a lot of crashes, of course is not new, you lied to your customers! I want my money back!",1
It was supposed to be new and unlocked but received in an open box with not instructions book and this is to use only with Sprint. Why they tell lies and make us lose time buying things we have to return?,1
"Apple iPhone 5 16GB - Desbloqueado - Negro (reacondicionado certificado)Vendido por: RAZAThis iphone not come completely miss your accessory like taco, only wine I need cable and check it as such in its operation",1
Phone does not hold own charge. Has to be on charger 90% of the time. Will cost over $100 to replace battery. Horrible! Had to rate before could write review,1
Bought this for my daughter who had her brand new IPhone stolen. Phone looks good but battery only lasts one hour. When I tried to call Amazon they could not give me sellers direct info. Said they can contact seller for me. 15 minutes later still on the phone waiting for a solution from Amazon. Amazon is not standing by this product,1
"The iPhone 5 is great. No scratches and everything turned out well. I wish it had a tool where I could open up the SMS card holder/opening. Overall, I love my new phone. I'm just having trouble with Siri.",4
It's not what sold on your site. It's a locked Verizon phone. Not unlocked att phone as advertised. Wasted over two hours of my time. I bought this in good faith. They sucks,1
"Phone was unlocked upon purchase and worked fine until a restore caused it to restore to its locked status. SIM card no longer works in it. From the best I can tell, the provider unlocked the phone through hacking methods. Do not buy,",1
The Apple IPhone 5 didn't meet my expectations it's keep on going off and on.The iPhone is always warm.I thought it's a new IPhone 5.I don't like this phone it's given me so many problems right now.The Watch is ok Bt d IPhone 5 is not in good condition. The charger can't recharge d IPhone 5,1
The phone is almost new in the outside and functions perfectly. The only drawback on my side is that the battery is very weak but of course I couldn't expect everything on the phone to be perfect for half its price so overall I am very happy with my Iphone :-),5
I didn't check when it arrived and I send them to India .one is working fine but other is asking for PIN number .Not able to use that phone.what to do.,1
"cant make calls without loud static in the background, problem with the mic on the dock connector that used during calls, can only hear calls on speaker",2
The iPhone itself was in excellent condition but the battery is just no worth the purchase even when fully charged the phone can barely last 2 hours and shuts off by itself even when it's nowhere mead dead. I STRONGLY WOULD ADVISE YOU TO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND ANOTHER 60+ to replace the battery.,1
Wasn't white and battery dies very quickly. Have disabled everything and the battery still dies within a couple hours. If I use Siri or wifi or Bluetooth battery drains in minutes.,1
It came broken. Battery is overheating. Home button doesn't work. It was a gift and it was sent far away so I can't return it anymore. Very disappointed!,1
"I ordered this phone for the price. I was a little nervous about it being refurbished, but as it turns out, it's perfect. I have had no problems whatsoever. It looks and acts like it is brand new! I am very satisfied.",5
This phone has been in use less than a week and it is going crazy malfunctioning and it keeps doing things like its possessed. Probably will end up returning.,1
"Hi, i bought two phones in October 2015 from this supplier, and one the phones no longer works. At first it was the battery which we changed and now unless plugged it does not even ignite. Very disappointing.",1
"The iPhone came without the original case and the earphones case was broken a little,but overall it was fine. The iPhone had very few scratches and looked new. Came with about 20% battery",4
"Phone arrived well packaged, but I was never able to register it with tracfone. Everything else worked, but I could not receive calls, even after several hours on the phone/online help with both apple and tracfone, so I had to send the phone back.",4
"I am a first time iphone user. The phone is great, I see why they are so popular. I am concerned about battery life though. It seems to get low with moderate use in just a half day. I don't know if this is normal or my ""new"" battery is weak..",3
"This is our 2nd iPhone 5 from this seller. The first phone came with almost no battery life, but was pleasantly returned & replaced. The replacement phone has more limited battery life than I would like, but not nearly as bad as the original.",4
The phone is exactly as described although the battery life of the phone is not great. I suggest the company replace the battery before selling it or get a better battery carrier (if they already replace the battery before selling) all in all I'm very pleased with my purchase.,4
"DONT BUY IT keep you time ""Refurbished NEW "" UFFF yea people rigth about the battery only 1 hour hold battery 100% to 0 WATH what is tha No good for the price 200$ Naaa is used scratch dent dirty Naaa Of course I return",1
So small and bulky. I own and love other apple products but not that commited to the cause. I returned it and bough a Samsung galaxy. I wanted a bigger screen. Not sure if my comment still counts.,3
It's not what sold on your site. It's a locked Verizon phone. Not unlocked att phone as advertised. Wasted over two hours of my time. I bought this in good faith. They sucks,1
"Phone was unlocked upon purchase and worked fine until a restore caused it to restore to its locked status. SIM card no longer works in it. From the best I can tell, the provider unlocked the phone through hacking methods. Do not buy,",1
The phone worked the first day and then it never worked again it just keeps crashing I'm just going to buy my apple products from apple so I don't have to hassle with waiting for a refund or trying to get a replacement,1
"The battery will not charge only had it for 2 days. I let it charge for 8 hours before using it and getting sim card .The phone is scratch free works well is the downside is the charger, and the focus is out of whack on the back camera. Also iPhone 5 batteries majority were recalled so it'll cost a pretty penny to get a new one .",2
The phone was in great condition turned on and work in initially as expected but then again glitches turn off without any kind of warning however it was returned it easily without any kind of problem which I believe is a plus for the vendor so I rated it at least a 4 star,4
"The camera is blurry when trying to take pictures. Even wiping the lense doesn't help, so I figured maybe the problem is on the inner part, instead of the outer. The front camera is fine.",3
"The phone tends to completely shut off when its battery life is anywhere from 50% to 5%, and is not covered by Apple warranty meaning the cost to repair its battery by the manufacturers is priced around 200 dollars. Not really worth the money, if you're looking for a cheap refurbish then the iPhone 5s might be better well suited.",2
The phone would not hold a charge. We charged all night and within two hours it would die after unplugging. Twice it went dead with over 40% battery life. Returned after one day.,1
"Easy to move to new AT&T non contract account. Charger wasn't iphone brand but works great. We read bad reviews on this refurbished phone, but phone exceeded our expectations.",5
"Apple iPhone 5 16GB - Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished)It is an Apple iPhone 5 16GB - Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished) This phone has battery problems, problems with the touch screen and the camera.This is not the product I expected and I need a seller's response to these problems and a solution to it.",1
"This phone came without all original accessories (no earphones, no SIM ejection tool, and no quick-start guide). More importantly, its battery was beyond its useful life. Do not purchase this product.",1
DearI have problems with the purchased equipmentwith 100% charged battery does not last or 3 hours of useand sometimes indicates a full battery charge being dischargedas we do to fix it?regards,2
Phone does not hold own charge. Has to be on charger 90% of the time. Will cost over $100 to replace battery. Horrible! Had to rate before could write review,1
The phone would not hold a charge :(. It would go from 100% charged to 13% in a matter of 10 minutes...... This is my very first time dealing with Amazon and I must say I am very Unsatisfied :(,1
"this phone hasnt been working properly from i got it, and now it does work at all...i have taken it to several shops and no one seems to be able to help. worst by ever!!!",1
"Not unlocked. Description clearly states that it is an unlocked phone, however it is very much locked. Need to register with AT&T before using....Thankfully Amazon is great with returns.",1
"This phone purchase has been most acceptable and has worked perfectly since day one. Thrilled to have it, have GSM network and aboslutely no problems! Like brand new, would buy again from this seller if needed. Thank you so much, my daughter is thrilled with her upgrade.",5
"Came in early and had nothing wrong with it, works amazingly and came with two cases, charger, booklet and box! Would absolutely do business with them again!",5
"The phone came sooner then expected. The phone looked like new. They said there was some scratches on the phone, but it looked like new. Worked great. Very happy!",5
"this phone is blacklisted.. T-Mobile has a block on it & it was reported lost.. If T-Mobile allows me to connect the phone , I will change my review.. until then I'm very dissatisfied with your false advertising.",1
"I got the phone in the mail,powered it on,I love it,the only visible damage is a tiny scratch on the screen,but honestly it doesn't matter to me,I highly recommend this seller🙌🏽💯",5
Love it great phone and it was shipped on time and the phone is in great condition as promised. Never liked iPhones but now I love them. Very happy with purchase!,5
"Turns out to be a demo phone so has random things like contacts, photos, and other information that are not easy to get rid of because you cant reset the phone. Also apps cant be moved around so they just add on to a screen",1
Love my phone so far so good only had it for a week although I thought it was a 5s since that's what I selected...some how it changed into just a iphone5...still great though,5
"Absolutely a waste of time, battery did not work, only held charge for 20 minutes. Had to return and did not get the full refund. Pay a little more to get a new iPhone. We regret purchasing this one.",1
Came exactly how advertised and quick. Works great and buying upgraded refurbished is the way to go! The only downfall is the battery and that's just a matter of going to Apple store and getting the recall done for Iphone 5 battery upgrade program (already checked the IBN# and it's eligible). Great purchase overall!,4
"Phone was very dirty right out of the package. Phone overheats and screen cracked same day I got it, it was NEVER NEVER dropped, just in my purse and seller will not fix.",1
"The seller I got it from sold me a super glitchy phone. It was cheap, so I can't complain too much. But you'll have to tolerate the screen freezing, apps opening without you even touching the screen, and a few dropped calls.",1
"The phoñe has been working good since I received it and am very happy with it. I think the battery's a little weak though, as it Dosent seem to hold a charge real long, but maybe if I got Rid of some notifications it would help.",5
"Considering my last phone was heaping pile of dung, this one is a little slice of heaven. I'd never pay those ridiculous Apple prices so I got this one used and I couldn't be happier.",5
SUCKS... Granted it was Used... but the Comercial Re-Seller said it was a 9.8 out of 10 but it was delivered to me with a Broken Mic... Seriously don't these Re-Sellers care about Quality & Reputation,1
The I phone 5 is such an improvement over my previous iPhone. It is consistent and I enjoy it's reliability.No more dropped calls mid sentence.The seller encounter some shipping issues so time involved in receiving phone was greatly increased.It was ordered on 9/4 and arrived on 9/ 24. Oh well I have it now And am truly enjoying the iPhone.,4
I hate it!!!!! The iphone sucks. If you have an android phone keep it . I will never buy another iPhone. There are a lot of things that you cannot do on the iPhone that you can do on the android. The iphone gets hot and won't stay on. I didn't even want to give it a star but it made me.,1
"Phone works great! Got mine form Digitalandmore and it was brand new. I chose standard shipping which was 7-10 days, iPhone came in 3 days. My son LOVES his new phone! Thank you! Couldn't be happier!",5
"I haven't had this phone but a month and it's already acting up. The phone is freezing, kicking me out of apps, and responding when it wants to sometimes. It hasn't been dropped or otherwise damaged so it shouldn't be doing all of this. I have a 90 day warranty and I'd like a newer phone to be shipped to me.",1
After a while the phone stop working. I thought I was getting a good condition phone but it turns out to be fony. I will never buy another phone from y'all. I can't believe I spend so much on this phone and it doesn't work. I'm very disappointed in the product.,1
Just received my new IPhone 5 from Taylor wireless and so far so good! I was in the original packaging and I have not had any problems with it. If anything changes I will update!,5
PHONE WAS SOLD AS A NEW PHONE!!! PHONE HAS BEEN BLOCKED FOR 1 YEAR BY T MOBILE DUE TO A NON PAYMENT BY A PREVIOUS OWNER!!! THE PHONE IS USELESS TO ME. !!!!!!!,1
I like it the only thing is you have to put your phone on speaker phone when your on the phone and on the right side corner the screen is popes out a little bit and you can se light coming from it but other then that it's great hopefully I'll be able to get that stuff fixed,3
"New iPhone at a great price. Fast ship, great experience. Daughter tried 2 used iPhones on Ebay and was burned both time, Go new, go Amazon and you can't lose.",5
"Very happy with the product. Was delivered on time. Packaged well and everything that was described for example""unlocked T-Mobile phone"" is exactly what I received",5
"My son's shoes were stolen from a gathering. I already had these on order not realizing they were the EXACT pair that he had taken! Except these were new, arrived 2 days after his others were taken, and arrived perfectly fine! Very happy!",5
The iPhone worked ok until a week ago when the headset stopped working. So I couldn't hear anyone unless on speaker phone. But it didn't have any scratches or dents on it.,3

Bought iphone used. Worked great until a month into possession the carrier blocked my IMEI. Unfortunate for both seller and I. Have filed for a return and will see how it works out. I guess it's the risk you run for buying used.,3
"I didn't have any problem with the iPhone 5 itself. It's a great phone, however the seller I bought it from not only screwed up the order once, but did it twice. He kept sending me an iPhone 5 for ATT when the posting clearly stated this was a TMobile phone. Five stars for the phone...No stars for the seller.",5
Customer service was great. The phone was new in the box and sealed. The only issue was the phones IMEI being associated to another account with tmobile. But overall great IPhone!!!!,5

I love this Iphone 5 and is as pictured with no noticeable scratches on phone or screen. It works great and such a great step up from my iPhone 4 that I had. I will definitely order again from this supplier.,5
"Good exterior condition, the phone screen is disorientated when first unlocked which is pretty annoying when you are trying to quickly get things done.",3
I would give it 5 stars but I wasn't told by seller I would be purchasing a 3g phone which is a battery guzzler but I will use it on telcel network in Mexico which is not bad at all,4

"Sprint said this was not a valid ESN for their network...it was connected to the Sprint network, they just would not authorize it. It wasn't stolen, it just wasn't Sprint!",1
"Upgraded from iPhone 4 and switched to Sprint via Ting.com, from Verizon to lower $$ by 1/2 or less-- happiness!Sprint coverage in San Diego, CA seems to be just as good as Verizon, in areas I traverse.",5
Just got the phone today and I just opened up the package and I am already not too happy. Not only did the phone not come with a sim card but I came with no usb cord or plugin for the charger. Know all the running aroundbi have to do now just to see if the phone even works..I wouldve just saved my money and waited for my upgrade!!,1
I love my iPhone but it didn't come with SIM card which made things difficult with getting it turned on I had a lot of running around & phone calls to make on trying to get one so I which the seller was specific on that aspect,4
So the phone is beautiful!It looks great!!!!It turns on smoothly and feels do light!I decided to treat myself with something expensive. So I did I received it on the date I was told to. But I asked for a sprint iphone 5 [SPRINT] but I got a phone that works with SIM cards witch sprint doesn't do -_-What the heck do I do now -_-,2
"I upgraded from the iPhone 4 and this is even better than that. It's lighter and actually seems sturdier. Great camera, great storage, great speed. I love this phone.",5
"I was sold a phone that could not be activated because it is still attached to the original owners account. Its is therefor, useless. I am baffled by how a company is aloud to buy and sell a phone to consumers that cannot be used.",2
I got the phone and it said it was 'new' well I got it and it was still connected to someone else plan through sprint .. So either someone forgot to disconnect it from their plan or it was stollen,1
"I was expecting it look used but the phone was in perfect condition. I do not remember the seller mentioning I would need a sim card, however it wasn't a big deal. Went to apple store and got it for free and I was good to go!NO problems whatsoever with the phone!",5
"The only and i mean the ONLY reason this didnt get five stars is because it didnt come with a sim card. i had to search FAR AND WIDE for a damn sim card. your carrier,if they have any,gives them to u free, other than that phone works PERFECT .",4
"I was sold this iPhone and could not get it activated to my account to use it, so i am now stuck with it. i hope noone gets this phone because you will be screwed and not be able to use it.",1
"I had to return this phone because I couldn't get it hooked up where I live. Reported to them and they sent UPS to pick it up with a label. They made it so easy. Definitely would reccomend them. The phone came the next day in excellent condition. If you need a sprint phone, they're great. I just have to use AT&T out here.",5
The iPhone 5 that I purchased came packaged like new but when I took it to the Sprint store for activation they informed me that the phone was listed as lost or stolen & could not be activated. I was lucky enough to hang onto the phone so that I could return. I was worried that they would confiscate it.,1
"Bought my boyfriend an iPhone 5 here. Not only was the phone NOT new, when I took it to activate at Sprint, they turned me away because not only was the phone active on another account, it was reported STOLEN. They haven't replied to my emails, haven't refunded my money. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM.",1
"Sprint said this was not a valid ESN for their network...it was connected to the Sprint network, they just would not authorize it. It wasn't stolen, it just wasn't Sprint!",1

"Was in excellent condition for the price. The battery is a little funny but I've heard others complain too. There's a local company that works on Apple products, so I'll take it there.",5
I got thing to use with Ting awhile back. It is everything you'd expect from an iPhone in build quality and ease of use. In my opinion the 5 is the most solid all around phone they've made. The great thing about Apple products is if you take care of them they have a pretty solid resale.,5
I am absolutely estatic over this phone I totally love it. The phone was sent at a reasonable time I would definitely buy from this seller again. The product was exactly what was advertised in the photo I'm very pleased thanks for the best phone ever!!!!,5
"screen is already coming apart from the phone...not even a month has passed. The battery is swelling so much that it is forcing the glass screen to separate from the frame. Battery is on order hopefully this will rectify the problem, along with some super glue to put the phone back together.",3
"I have had this phone for about a month now I was having so much trouble trying to find a new UNLOCKED phone and all the ones I ordered either had a defect or they were not unlocked. This phone came in original box, unopened and works Perfectly!! I love it!!",5

It does work anywhere am in the Caribbean and it works just fine.the shipping was really fast only thing is the charger feels different from my I pad charger material feels more hard but other than that am okay with my product.,4
"Fast shipping....I do not know if the phone works or not...I purchased for overseas use, and will take with me overseas and there buy the micro sim card and hopefully, the phone will work as listed...it certainly looked great.....like new....",5
"Love this iPhone5! Light weight, easy to set up, great display features. Would highly recommend to any one who is not very technically savvy...The best ever!",5
i bought this iphone 5 on jan 27th and i recieved feb 1 that was fast. i would buy more stuff off this person again. Its a nice phone i bought. i sent a picture of the phone to my boyfriend and he liked the color and he cant wait to use it . hes in the service and i have to send it to him . hes excited to get it. i want to thank you again....,5
So far so good. Phone came faster than i expected. Seller emailed me to check on my satisfaction. I advised that the wall unit charger wasnt working and he sent a replacement no questions asked. Very satisfied so far with the phone. And fair price,4
So far so good freezes here an there can't always do what I want when I touch the screen takes a few tries due to freezing but over all good for the money I suppose ...,3
"At last, it is what is advertised! So much isnt nowadays, but this is indeed a brand new, in factory box unlocked iphone 5, which I immediately used a tminile prepaid sim with, works great, no problems!",5
The phone was refurbished and the charging port gave up a month after purchase. The phone is not picking up data or WiFi now and is giving me continuous problems. Buy at your own risk. I do not recommend making the investment through this company.,1

"Works Great so far. Got it for a Friend. So far no issues and getting it hooked up to T-Mobile was easy. No sim card needed. Just take it in and they supply their own Sim Card. Phone works great and even though there were a few scratches here and there, it over all was in great condition.",5
The lock button doesn't work all the time. Battery life is very sporadic ( I could have 26% left and then it could die next second). The hey Siri command doesn't work all the time. Besides that no issues.,3
"Bought this refurbished phone as a birthday gift from Joycells and it looked brand new. My wife loves it and it works flawlessly. We had to go to verizon for a free sim card, but had no issues and setup was easy. She has had it for about a month now and everything is working great. Big improvement in speed over the aging iphone 4 phones.",5
I ordered a iphone 5s and it came exactly as listed! It came in the amount of normal business shipping with all accessories included. I paid a very decent price and I definitly got my money's worth! Thank you!,5
"This phone was in top notch condition when it arrived, still even had the plastic peel screen on it like it had never even been used prior! So happy with it, thank you!!!",5
Thank you so much! My daughter loves her phone. Even though my crazy neighbors had me searching for my package you guys were great with assisting me on it!,5
Phone works great really no complaints. I paid a decent price for it barely any scratches or dents. Descriptions was accurate as could be which was something I was concerned about when purchasing a phone from amazon. Biggest hassle was not coming with a sim card but Verizon provides thought for free.,5
"It was over all a good phone , I mean I didn't expect much since it was at a good price . Only thing the battery is old . Prepare to spend some money on one .",3
Phone was in a way better condition than I thought it would be. I'm using it to wrote this review actually. This was a great deal & it came really quick. Thank you so much !,5
"First, the iPhone arrived 2 days late. This is a minor issue, but it was a gift.Secondly, the phone did not accept any sim cards at the Verizon Wireless store. The manager personally took the phone and ran 3 new sim cards through it and all 3 failed.",1
This was a gift for my husband. Cheaper than at Verizon. I came damaged free and shipped very quickly. I would buy this again. My husband is very happy with this phone (his 1st smartphone). I would buy this again.,5
From the looks of this phone it appears it is new and not refurbished. Now the power button will not work and the screen goes all haywire even if it is not in use. Make sure that you are asking the right questions before you place an order.,1
The phone came in good condition but in the description it mentioned the item coming with a charger and it didn't come with it. For the amount of money we paid the description should have been more clear.,1
Great price fast delivery. Phone was in like new condition. No scratches at all. Came with the original packaging as well. If you are in the market for an iPhone 5 I highly recommend great quality great price.,5
"iPhone is not compatible with many chargers, even official Apple brand chargers. Only works with charger that came with it and a Verizon brand car charger. Other than that works fine.",3
"I've had this phone for about 3 months now. Works great, and shipped that day and was delivered the next day! The only complaint I have is that the battery dies super quick, even without games and videos. I probably get about a couple hours of usage. But then again I did order a used-like new. Other than that I would recommend this phone.",4
"It's a good phone, especially for being used. My only problem with it is that sometimes the touch screen doesn't respond when it's plugged in/charging, and I did have to replace the charger cable that came with it because it stopped working.",5
I received my iPhone and it did not work I had to take it in and the battery had swelled up cause the screen to not clip in and the phone would not turn on after they replaced the battery it worked so I was unhappy as I had to pay $68 on top of buying the phone to get it to work,1
"The Apple iPhone 5 is more than satisfactory, and the price is appreciably less than buying it from my provider would have been. I saved $300. Good purchase!",5
"Phone works great. Haven't had any problems. There are a few odd quirks that I wouldn't have expected on an iPhone such as being unable to save a draft text message, which is something you get on a $15 flip phone. Also, Siri is useless. All in all, though, solid phone.",4
"It arrived with some slight scuffs on the sides and back but the phone screen was perfect. Phone works pretty much perfectly.Had to be nudged to ship it though, which was annoying.",4
battery life is terrible. this phone does not charge to 100 percent. goes from 100-0 real quick.. loses like 10 percent every 10 minutes. the connection is very slow and has a hard time loading. always turns off when the battery is around 10 percent. terrible phone terrible seller.,1
"I bought iphone 5 from this store, it had worked well only for the first three months then slowly get worse. self touching doesnt allow me to call or text to others. it is really annoying",1
"The package was delivered on time and packaged well. I was unable to activate the phone myself. Therefore, I went to the Verizon store for help as it had been advertised as a Verizon phone. They were unable to activate it either. I returned the phone today.",1
The Charger didn't work. The phone does not have good sound. When talking I can't hardly be heard good. Definatley not worth $200! Would like a refund or different phone.,2
"What can I say about the iPhone 5? My wife attempted upgrade from 4 with this Amazon seller and we received a defective phone. Be VERY careful with ""refurbished"", or ""loose"" (not in box and sealed) phones.Beware THIS seller in particular: ""Quag's Buy, Sell, Trade.""",5
After it was set to factory settings it was perfect. It should be reset by the seller so it could be perfect! The seller responded fast when I asked for help.,5
this phone was a peace of crap not only does it not work right now i have to go back to the store and get this phone deactivate you guys waisted my time and my money,1
Outdated phone would not accept updates and locked up if you tried. We ended up trading it on a new IPhone for our son and got more on trade than I paid for the phone.,3
This was promised to be a Verizon phone. It is a T Mobile phone. I cannot receive calls or make calls on it as Verizon service is not supported on a Tmobile phone. Also it has a terrible battery. From a full 100% charge it on will last 15 minutes max. It is worthless.,1
The phone was delivered and all that was included in the package was physically in very good condition.... but the battery was dead and had to be immediately replaced. That was very disappointing and I believe I should have been informed before buying it...,1
Works very well. Shipped very quickly and is still working great a few months later. Very happy with my purchase. One drawback my home button has an iPhone 4 square but who cares the phone works,5
I've had this phone for over a month now and I'm very satisfied with it as a whole and knowing that this was used I expected the scuffs and scratches on the sides and corners but for the price this phone works like brand new,5
Got the phone somewhat quickly. The phone was dinged up on the corners but the screen was in good condition. The battery that came with it was not holding a charge so took it to the iPhone store and they replaced it for free cause there was a recall or something on those batteries. Overall satisfied,4
"I bought this used and it had few noticeable scratches that weren't mentioned. I enjoy this product, it works faster than the iPhone 4s and came with new fully functional charger, headphones and cord. I am very happy with my purchase.",4
"excellent item ,like new,and eventually I got a 32G version ，the iphone is unlocked，verizon A1429，everything is fine but the delivery too slow。It spent almost 3 monthes till I got the iphone .",5
"This product was in great shap, and it was packaged well. I do recommend Amazon for used good products. The produc I orded and receoved in 4 days was, Apple Iphone 5. I was very, very pleased. Julie",5
"Phone came with hardly any scratches or issues. It has been working for almost four months now without any problems. Outstanding alternative to buying the same quality phone from the Apple Store for three times the cost. I was actually surprised that this wasn't a hoax, so if that's your concern this is actually legit.",5
I bought a iPhone5. Was told it was a brand new phone. A month after I bought it the front facing camera stopped working. Took it in to get fixed and I was told by the repair man that the camera stopped working because it was damaged when a new screen was installed. Home button spins. And was told there is a different SIM card in this phone.,1
"Refurbished but not properly because there is not work microphone 🎤 properly and must talk throw the speaker, at service center say OMG you must change more the one MIC",2
"Purchase and delivery went smooth, but phone quit working after 2 months. No reason, no damage just quit working and of course the warranty is only 30 days and this has been 50 days. Not really happy, I paid alot of money for a little over a month of phone",1
"It's a good phone, especially for being used. My only problem with it is that sometimes the touch screen doesn't respond when it's plugged in/charging, and I did have to replace the charger cable that came with it because it stopped working.",5
The phone didn't work! Spent hours with Verizon to only find out I bought a dud. Never again do I try a refurbished phone. I will say the return was easy.,1
Phone came in with more scratches than stated on screen. Not to happy about that on the money i payed for the phone. Phones to seem to be on. Lags a lot but Verizon said it the phone or software,3
Love my Iphone. I was replacing a 3 year old Iphone 5 that went swimming in the pool. It does come in an Apple box and was packaged exactly like the Iphone 5 I had bought before. The shipping was a little slow but maybe it just seemed that way because I had no phone.,5
"Activation time has been 12 months, but fortunately did not scratch the screen and the frame. But a lot better than the $ 371.24 trap of ATT.THANKYOU.",5
Everything about this phone works great! Exactly as described and a great deal! Exactly what I was looking for and the extra accessories were a great help when going from an iPhone 4s to 5!,5
When we ordered this iPhone we asked for a Verizon iPhone and we received an at&t phone. Verizon did give us a credit for the phone but not as much as we paid for the phone. Not happy lost $150.00,1
"I AM IN THE NAVY AND BOUGHT THIS PHONE WHILE OVERSEAS. I SENT IT TO MY HOUSE FOR WHEN I RETURNED HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS. BUT WHEN I RETURNED HOME I TRIED TO ACTIVATE THE PHONE AND VERIZON TOLD ME IT WAS STOLEN AND THAT THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO !!! SO I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER AT FULL RETAIL PRICE, A HUGE WASTE OF 400 $ !!",1
"I was already an iPhone lover, I bought this to upgrade my iPhone 4. I have unlimited data through Verizon, so I had to make a third party purchase. This seller was great, everything was included and description was valid.",4
I had a problem with the phone a few days after I got it. I had to hook it up to the computer to restore it. However after that I haven't had any issues with it. Phone shipped faster then I was told which was great.,4
I ordered this as a gift. My friend spent hours at Verizon trying to activate it when in the end it was a sprint phone and he ended up not being able to use it.,1
I ordered and said it was basically new and basically was am happy with what I got minus the charger broke after a week but other then that everything was great.,5
Phone I received looked brand new. Not even a scratch. '''This isn't one of those fake posts fr. ive had it at least 8 months now and its still working like a champ,5
"The phone was delivered quickly (it came before the expected delivery date) and has worked perfectly with no problems. When we received it we went to verizon wireless and they gave us the memory card and activated the phone with no problems and no additional costs. The phone was in great condition, looked virtually brand new.",5
"Has a lot of drops and scratches and one of the volume bottoms doesn't work, would be nice If I could get a better one sent to me but i don't know if guys can do that?",3
Seller was very nice when my sister and I didn't realize that the screen protector was left on and thought we saw spots on the screen...we are air heads lol. seller answered promptly and so far no problems although we haven't had it connected to Verizon yet.,5
I received the iPhone 5 and was extremely happy with the phones condition. outbox Not so much as a fingerprint or any blemishes whatsoever. The phone functions perfectly as advertised. And the company stay with me step-by-step of the milling process. Overall extremely happy,5
"I bought this phone refurbished only two months ago, and it's already not working properly. The screen glitches and it won't allow me to type or use the screen at all for that matter.",1
The Iphone was in great condition physical wise no visible scratches but the main camera is missing the glass len which produces poor picture quality which was not mentioned. Definitely would like my refund.,1
"It arrived with some slight scuffs on the sides and back but the phone screen was perfect. Phone works pretty much perfectly.Had to be nudged to ship it though, which was annoying.",4
"Solid working iphone 5 in great physical and hardware condition, but the battery has been absolute garbage since the day I bought it. I guess that's the risk of buying something refurbished.",3
Thank you mobile spree for accepting my return with no questions asked. The product was as advertised I will definitely purchase from you again. Thanks Pete,5
"The phone I received was exactly what was stated in the description. No defects, scratches or other. The items was quickly paired with the carrier (verizon) and activated. We were able to port the phone number from a different carrier onto the phone without issue. All functions work like it was brand new out of the box. Excellent purchase.",5
"As far as the sale, everything went smooth. The phone is in good conditions but seems to have some technical issues, it shuts down on its own for some reason.",4
"We had to upgrade to this because the iPhone 4s has issues when upgrading to the latest ios. However, this phone doesn't work with page plus cellular and it's not compatible with our docking stations. Other than that, it's great!",4
Have always owned apple products so bought my grandson an Apple iPhone. The phone seemed to have a mind of its own. Had to return it. Tried everything possible to fix it but didn't work. I did return the phone and was refunded.,1
Horrible. Started having battery trouble after a month and then at 2 months sim card doesn't work anymore. So now have to buy a new phone again after wasting money on this one.,1
Do not order a used one the price is cool but it shuts off whenever it wants and it goes black whenever it wants your battery can be %50 and it will cut off and won't come until you charge it,2
"I received the phone and the battery was done. I charged it multiple times and the phone just randomly cuts off after a certain %, generally 65. Will not buy another products from this seller.",2
so far the phone seems to operate a promised. I had very difficult time synching with my bluetooth earpiece. I wen to T-mobile and they had the same issue. Just as I was about to give up it started working. That was a huge relief.,4
Came as described and on the day it was supposed to arrive. Unlocked phone was necessary as we are from Canada and needed to use local service provider and sim card. Once set up it worked well with no issues.,5

I've had the phone for about a month now and all I've had is problems with it.

"I was expecting to receive it in black, but it was white.However, it was seized by the French customs so I had to pay 109 to take it back.Disgusting!!!",2
"This items is very good! I using in japan now. Japan is best this cellular. Maybe, I think this iPhone5(cdma unlocked) is that it is a cellular had been longing for many Japanese.",5
"I was already an iPhone lover, I bought this to upgrade my iPhone 4. I have unlimited data through Verizon, so I had to make a third party purchase. This seller was great, everything was included and description was valid.",5
"This phone is great. What I love about apple is that their phones and their programs always work. The OS is stable no matter whether you're using an iphone, a mac or an ipad.",5
"i thought i already reviewed this, but ok. i love it, minor issues with the phone not working with the sim card, called the seller who got back to me right away. we tried everything to fix the one i was sent. returned it and was sent another right away. the seller went above and beyond what i had expected.",5
"Great phone and it can be used with multiple other carriers, I put my simcard (you will have to cut down the simcard if you do not have a microsimcard) into the Verizon phone and it is unlocked and works great. It is a little faster than the older model iPhones and a little bit bigger all in all I am satisfied and it is a good phone.",5
"what more could I ask for? I ditched my iphone 4s for android, since i use a lot of google products. since google is now writing apps that are compatible with IOS, i switched back to apple. i am glad i did....This is a fantastic phone. Great screen, very fast LTE connection, IOS 6.2. Excellent camera, etc.",5
battery life is terrible. this phone does not charge to 100 percent. goes from 100-0 real quick.. loses like 10 percent every 10 minutes. the connection is very slow and has a hard time loading. always turns off when the battery is around 10 percent. terrible phone terrible seller.,1
"I bought iphone 5 from this store, it had worked well only for the first three months then slowly get worse. self touching doesnt allow me to call or text to others. it is really annoying",1
"Bought this refurbished phone as a birthday gift from Joycells and it looked brand new. My wife loves it and it works flawlessly. We had to go to verizon for a free sim card, but had no issues and setup was easy. She has had it for about a month now and everything is working great. Big improvement in speed over the aging iphone 4 phones.",5
I ordered a iphone 5s and it came exactly as listed! It came in the amount of normal business shipping with all accessories included. I paid a very decent price and I definitly got my money's worth! Thank you!,5
"This phone was in top notch condition when it arrived, still even had the plastic peel screen on it like it had never even been used prior! So happy with it, thank you!!!",5
"As far as the sale, everything went smooth. The phone is in good conditions but seems to have some technical issues, it shuts down on its own for some reason.",4
"We had to upgrade to this because the iPhone 4s has issues when upgrading to the latest ios. However, this phone doesn't work with page plus cellular and it's not compatible with our docking stations. Other than that, it's great!",4
The battery is faulty. Dies randomly when there's plenty of battery life left and drains from 50% to 20% in minutes. The lock button is temperamental. I have to push it 5 times before it actually locks. Very dissatisfied with my purchase as none of these details were disclosed in item description.,1
The phone has given me nothing but problems not holding a charge shutting on & off truly dissatisfied however cosmetically pleasing despite the technical issues,2
"I've had this phone for about 3 months now. Works great, and shipped that day and was delivered the next day! The only complaint I have is that the battery dies super quick, even without games and videos. I probably get about a couple hours of usage. But then again I did order a used-like new. Other than that I would recommend this phone.",4
"What can I say about the iPhone 5? My wife attempted upgrade from 4 with this Amazon seller and we received a defective phone. Be VERY careful with ""refurbished"", or ""loose"" (not in box and sealed) phones.Beware THIS seller in particular: ""Quag's Buy, Sell, Trade.""",5
"The phone is great. I have been an iPhone person since day one. I bought this for my girlfriend and this is her first iPhone. Too bad it is with Verizon, their customer service lacks compared to AT&T.",5
"The iphone is almost new but with some little scratch on the body.The adapter is absolutely used for a long time with some kind of red mark.The imei was different with the box.It was claimed to be liked new and fulfilled by Amazon Warehouse, I believe its just a ""Used - very good"" one :-(",3
Everything was perfect. Exactly how described and it got here early. Only thing that was missing was the car charger but no worries. Will definitely use this again.,5
"Working very well. Came with a few scratches,but no biggie, only thing is that the description said the glass was perfect, but it was lifted on the side a bit near the power button, but I can deal, and like I said works great!",4
"It's a sweet phone, and it is meeting my expectations!The only gripe I have is that the phone was advertised having more memory than it had when it arrived. My suggestion: the product advertised should match exactly the product which is shipped.",4
"Within two weeks of owning the phone, the phone would only hold a charge for 1.5 hours maximum. Today, it stopped accepting a charge altogether, and I tried charging it with two different iPhone 5 chargers, with no result.",1
"Received my phone in a timely manner,and was happy when I got a 64g when I had ordered the 32g. Finally get to using the phone and its was dead by my lunch break. Battery life was horrible and the serial number on the phone didn't match the box. These are advertised as new but are certainly reburbished, STAY AWAY IF YOU WANT A NEW PHONE !",1
This phone does not allow me Bluetooth or Wi-Fi abilities. I cannot update or get any apps. I am a realtor and I cannot use my SupraKey. I tried to call vendor and just get voicemail saying call back later. Not Happy!,1
"Ordered this phone for my daughter basses on the description and it was everything they said. My daughter is loving her iPhone. We both thought it looked like New, really no visibly marks.",5
"Had it for a couple days now and everything is going good, Verizon activated and I've been using it non stop. I looked for every flaw on the phone that people listed here and I couldn't find any. Even if I did I would call them and they would be glad to fix it asap. Love my new phone",5
horrible the phone has so many internal problems the outside looks nice to fool you but it has so many glitches it's not even funny. Horrible service. & delivered 5 days after the 2 day delivery promise,1
2 months after purchasing suddenly the battery life is terrible! Nothing I have done has helped and it goes from 50% to dead in seconds some times. All other functions are fine but I've had to start carrying a booster battery to restart my phone.,2
Very satisfied with my purchase. My husband is very happy with his slightly used phone. Will order from this company again. Had the phone 2 days after I ordered it and it was very easy to get it activated.,5
"It worked fine until I went to activate it then the screen went black and nothing could be done. The return however, I would give 5 stars no issues at all",1
This phone looks innocent but I had a bad feeling about the battery life. When I checked it out the shake to undo was on I thought that there was something wrong with the phone. AN NOW I Know THE BATTERY LIFE IS S*** let's hope I live until I get my iPhone 5s next week,3
I really like it. the phone condition was better than he decribes it. that was definitely a steal. i would buy from this seller again. ***big thumbs up***,5
Purchased as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. Definitely a step up from his Iphone 4s. Did not have any problems getting it activated by Verizon. Works beautifully.,4
"I love my phone!! It works perfect in Venezuela. It just has a little scratch in the front (almost invisible), the headphones are NEW.I definitely would buy from this seller again",5
the phone was excellent. only problem I had was the charger already had a shortage when it arrived and I have not gotten an response back from the seller when I contacted him letting him know,3
"Just came today, although someone returned my daughter's actual phone, she now has a back up phone. I'm charging it as I'm writing this review. She will still owe me for it so she won't be stuck with a 3g phone the next time she loses her phone. And it came with all the accessories.",5
"iPhone arrived quickly and met the description. I am very pleased with my purchase, I felt the price was unbeatable and the quality of the phone was excellent.",5
"The phone have batteries problem. It doesn't charge, I had to buy new batteries for it and it's still do the same thing. Long story short, the phone is not good at all. Now I have to get a now phone because this one runs out of battery in minutes.",2
"the phone is in good conditions but the battery is completely messed up and when it hits 20%, it shuts off in less than a minute so I have to charge it once or more every day",3
The one I got was a little more beat up than I expected. It still works like it should but cosmetically it's rough. It would be helpful if that was more clear in the description. Wouldn't buy another one from this seller.,3
"Phone looks scratched up in corners and on back. No cracks on front though and it did easily work with my verizon plan. Battery doesn't last more than a couple hours. Had to buy car, office and home charger because of such short battery life.",2
"The phone was listed in ""good"" condition, when I received it it looked fine, until i realized it had a bumper on it, the body was completely cracked and chipped, the touch screen barely works and there is no sound, but I needed the phone badly so I kept it.",1
These phones are REFURBISHED and not advertised or priced as such! Discovered when the battery began to swell and the screen popped out and I needed to call Apple. Would not buy again.,1
"I understand that it is an refurbished phone but within a week of using it I have already had to replace the battery witch coasted 70 dollars to have done. Which in my case is a huge let down,",1
"It was a nightmare for the first 24 hours!!! The phone came locked from the previous buyer. After an entire day of trying to chase him down did he finally call from CA. and cleared the phone. Since then we haven't had ANY problems, and my son LOVES the phone!!",4
"Bought this for my daughter to use on Page Plus, and she likes it. I personally am not a fan of Apple products (can't replace the battery, no memory expansion options, have to use iTunes on the computer, etc) but the phone does what she wants.",4
I ordered 2 Apple Iphone 5 32GB White- Verizon Phones for my teenage sons for Christmas. The phones work great & both boys were very excited about their very first phone. Received both phones by delivery date. Very satisfied with seller and phones.,5
"Hesitant from reviews, but my phone after three weeks of trying every feature works great! Came in box with encoded repair order on it, looks like they fixed some things on it but works like it should!",5
"The phone was in good condition but sometimes won't charge and even with a full battery it dies in a few hours. I wish I had just paid full price for a new phone. This is a HUGE inconvenience, especially since I paid almost $300 for the phone and now had to buy a new battery.",2
"Received this and had issues with it almost immediately. The top button was jammed [critical to functioning, like turning the phone on and off, locking the screen, screen shotting] and now the port to charge it no longer works. I only purchased it a couple months ago and already need a new phone.",2
Works ok but battery doesn't last long and phone sometimes shuts off with a low battery signal even when it still has around 20-30% of the battery life left. It's a pain.,2
It's not perfect. If you need an upgrade it's probably a good idea. It didn't come with a SIM card and the battery drains quickly but aside from that it's a nice phone.,3
Not really happy had to purchase a new battery as soon as I got up and running. the phone makes weird sounds in your ear while talking on it. For a refurbished Verizon phone I should have spent the money and just purchased new.,2
"Said it was a Verizon phone but...could NOT activate through Verizon and kept flashing AT&T at the top left corner when I tried to activate. Oh and it's a 5s with a new face on it....so it's been a ""repaired"" iPhone.",1
I really like it. the phone condition was better than he decribes it. that was definitely a steal. i would buy from this seller again. ***big thumbs up***,5
"The phones battery needed to be switched out, was not comparable with a lot of apps, shut off whenever it wanted and only ever lasted hours. It looked new but acted as if it wasn't.",2
I was very pleased overall. I received immediate notification of my order. I was pleased with the phone and how soon I received. Very professional and highly recommended!,5
The external speaker is distorted. Can't hear or understand anything on it. This wasn't mentioned in the product listing.So the Siri and navigation function might as well not exist.,1
"The seller that I bought from wouldn't ever email me back and once the phone got here, it had nicks and dings in the outer metal and the screen is messed up in one spot beneath the surface and now the screen can be bended in on the side and top right corner. You get what you pay for I guess.",2
"Phone looks awesome, almost new ""looking"" However, this phone doesn't hold a charge worth a damn. My daughter has to walk around with a portable battery charger because her phone will die at any percentage shown on screen. Lesson learned by purchasing a third party Apple product.",2
"Software issues within the first week, speaker issues immediately. Go buy a new one never refurbished from these guys, GREAT customer service when I emailed them about poor phone though",1
Great product. Didn't know we had to replace the battery so quickly. That was kind of expensive. We didn't know that the phone was as small as it was. Not the seller's fault.,4
"The phones battery needed to be switched out, was not comparable with a lot of apps, shut off whenever it wanted and only ever lasted hours. It looked new but acted as if it wasn't.",2

"The battery is useless, I have to almost always have it on a charger and it doesn't qualify for the free swap out. The mic that a phone call and snapchat use doesn't work, and it has a horrible time picking up Wifi. This was good in a pinch, but I wish I'd saved my money up and bought one from Apple.",2
I received a phone that was already activated and locked so i had to wait an extra week and a half for a new phone. The second time around everything was perfect as far as I can tell.,4
"We ordered two phones, recovered them yesterday. One is fine thus far, mine you can't hear out of and people can't hear you and if you or they can it echoes.",2
"The phone was not compatible with the network. When taken to the store to activate, they said the serial number was not recognizable or linked to any type of device period. So frustrating!!!",1
"It was said that the new phone, and the phone came without a box open, in a plastic bag. Has its original charge, put do not know what the other is charging. Generally awful !!!",1
Good phone. No problems with appearance or operation. I had to replace the battery within a few months. Mildly inconvenient but not expensive or a big deal really. I felt I received a good value.,4
Phone does not work. The internal speaker is defective. only speaker phone works for hearing phone calls. AlsoSent with charger for an iPhone 4. So can not charge with it. Probably just spend for a repair after the time invested in reinstalling everything.,1
"Don't buy this iPhone, the battery doesn't work well and I have to charge the phone every hour, the iPhone also works very slow , I really really don't recommend you to buy this iPhone, I don't wanna give this post a star but I have to, so I can share my experience I had with this iPhone",1
"cant make calls without loud static in the background, problem with the mic on the dock connector that used during calls, can only hear calls on speaker",2
The iPhone itself was in excellent condition but the battery is just no worth the purchase even when fully charged the phone can barely last 2 hours and shuts off by itself even when it's nowhere mead dead. I STRONGLY WOULD ADVISE YOU TO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO SPEND ANOTHER 60+ to replace the battery.,1
"This product is FAKE. It did not work when I bought it. I bought it it when I was in USA, but offered it to my daughter who lives abroad. It did not charge and looked fake.",1
"Phone is fine but TMobile reduced band width for i5 unlocked phones resulting in no 4G data access in our area , display ""E"" according to my grandaughter.",5
Wasn't white and battery dies very quickly. Have disabled everything and the battery still dies within a couple hours. If I use Siri or wifi or Bluetooth battery drains in minutes.,1
It came broken. Battery is overheating. Home button doesn't work. It was a gift and it was sent far away so I can't return it anymore. Very disappointed!,1
"I like the looks and that it was unlocked. But it doesn't connect at all to wifi. The battery doesn't hold a charge for even a day. The clock is off by an hour. But the phone and messaging works. So basically I just bought a very expensive phone, since that is all it is good for! Refurbished isn't really accurate.",1
It didn't come with a charger so I had to go buy that.This is a new phone for me because I've never had iPhone.No instructions as how to set up.I would buy from this dealer again but I'll always ask more guestions.,4
I would recommend this to anyone. I got the white iPhone 5 and it's amazing for a certified refurbished phone. I don't usually write reviews but this product is so good I had to,5
Phone says it's unlocked will only work on wifi the phone is a version phone and will not sync with my AT&T plan. Can only make calls without wifi. On description it did not say what company phone is from,1
"Phone had bad phone speaker, issues with the battery life indicater (either has full battery or 1%, nothing in between). Seller offered a refund/replacement and was cool, I just couldn't be without a phone for 2-4 weeks.",2
I didn't check when it arrived and I send them to India .one is working fine but other is asking for PIN number .Not able to use that phone.what to do.,1
Best deal ever! Got it because my son broke his screen. This was in EXCELLENT condition and 32GB! And the best part it wasn't expensive. Drove him back to school and we listened to music plus got turn by turn directions. I have just a generic cellphone. Actually thinking about getting an IPhone if I can find one from this provider!,5
Phone was in poor condition... The Screen Had several scratches.. It was scuffed... The battery could hold a charge.. It went from 100% to 20% in less than 30min.... So I ended up paying $120 for new battery & screen and other cosmetics...,1
came to me with the home button broken and had many problems with trying to charge the phone fixed that 30$ later and has now just broke after 4 months of use. Was not dropped or treated badly in anyway,1
"Phone looked great but when I tried to activate the SIM card it wouldn't take any card I put in it. Tried three different carriers, the return was pretty smooth.",2
The charger that came with the phone is not the original charger and my phone has completely stopped charging. I need some form of compensation or an original charger.,1
"Really bad iphone. The screen should be white and this is YELLOW! The battery is terrible and the product said was NEW and is NOT NEW AT ALL! THE WORSE PRODUCT I HAVE BOUGHT EVER! And the phone has a lot of crashes, of course is not new, you lied to your customers! I want my money back!",1
"Phone works fine, but the battery isn't great. Just have to keep a charger on you. Other than that, you would never know this was a refurbished phone.I feel like it is slightly overpriced for just being a 5 and being refurbished. I should have bought the 5S new for about 20$ more.",3
"I was very impressed with the phone I purchased. We have had no issues with the phone, and it looked brand new. I would use this seller again. It arrived on time, and was packaged very well. Im surprised you could get a phone in this condition for so cheap.",5
"This is our 2nd iPhone 5 from this seller. The first phone came with almost no battery life, but was pleasantly returned & replaced. The replacement phone has more limited battery life than I would like, but not nearly as bad as the original.",4
"DONT BUY IT keep you time ""Refurbished NEW "" UFFF yea people rigth about the battery only 1 hour hold battery 100% to 0 WATH what is tha No good for the price 200$ Naaa is used scratch dent dirty Naaa Of course I return",1
"battery and battery indicator were both defective; it would not charge beyond 77% after the first day and after 10 minutest of stand-by, the charge was at 17%; then after a few minutes of use the charge indicated 3%; then it went to 42% for a few minutes and turned off; i tried resetting it but no improvement; an awful experience;",1
"Battery is faulty. Dealfinder was great at communicating, and did offer me the 30 day return option, but I had waited so long to get the phone that I've decided to purchase a replacement battery and replace it on my own. Phone works great besides the bad battery.",4
"The phone was supposed to be unlocked, but it wasn't. Only accepted either Att SIM card or T mobile. Battery lasted 4 hours with no use even less if In use. I would never recommend a used phone. Just save yourself time and money buy new",1
Phone is working fine and everything works fine . But the charger and charger cable provided is not working properly .Battery last only one day maximum . I am not sure that's about other iPhone 5 battery and if all iPhone 5 are like that then that is fine.,3
The keys and icons on the extreme right portion of the touch screen don't function properly. need to reload the phone every time when it doesn't work. I would like to return this phone and exchange it with other I-phone of same kind.,2
"I'm so happy that the product arrived sooner than expected. The phone itself it's fine. My only concern is that the battery seems to not last what's supposed to. However, comparing this price to the original it's way cheaper and I'm considering going to the Apple store and changing the battery there. My mobile carrier is AT&T and it works fine.",4
"I amvery disappointed that only after just purchasing the item for 5 months the battery for my I5 Model A1429 has gone bad. This will cause me to have to replace the battery, LCD Screen Display with Digitizer Touch Panel. How can I get in touch with the supplier?Apple iPhone 5 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Cell Phone - Black (Certified Refurbished)",2
The phone says certified refurbished but it is broken. Won't accept a SIM card so it's basically useless. I took this to Apple and they said it's not even a true Apple phone.,1
Extremely poor quality. This is the 3rd one we have gone through. There is always something wrong with them. The software is corrupt and we lost everything on our phone when trying to back it up.,1
"Phone was guarenteed refurbished & began having battery malfunctions, glitches, resetting unexpected, the keyboard touch screen wouldn't register touch. Maybe jus 1:10 or 1:100 but I returned mine. Return process was smooth.",1
This phone is great. The small annoyances of the 4S are gone with the 5. And buying refurbished is even better. A practically new phone for half the price? SOLD!,5
"Phone came with 0% battery. Took hours to charge and when 100% charged, it took 10 mins to drain the battery to 50%. Phone shutdown occasionally. I also noticed LCD defect while pressing the screen. Screen also flickered a lot. Phone was returned in less than 24 HR . Very bad job by the vendor",1
I would recommend this to anyone. I got the white iPhone 5 and it's amazing for a certified refurbished phone. I don't usually write reviews but this product is so good I had to,5
Phone does not hold own charge. Has to be on charger 90% of the time. Will cost over $100 to replace battery. Horrible! Had to rate before could write review,1
"I was scheptical about ordering this due to the bad reviews, but I thought I would give it a try. Although the phone arrived in record time and looks brand new, the battery only holds a charge for about 2 hours, and dies at 40%. Seller was no help. I am returning, but will give them another shot. I'll update when the second one arrives.",2
The phone would not hold a charge. We charged all night and within two hours it would die after unplugging. Twice it went dead with over 40% battery life. Returned after one day.,1
"Easy to move to new AT&T non contract account. Charger wasn't iphone brand but works great. We read bad reviews on this refurbished phone, but phone exceeded our expectations.",5
"Apple iPhone 5 16GB - Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished)It is an Apple iPhone 5 16GB - Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished) This phone has battery problems, problems with the touch screen and the camera.This is not the product I expected and I need a seller's response to these problems and a solution to it.",1
"The iPhone itself is amazing, but the battery does not last half a day. I can't trust it to be available if needed in an emergency due to battery life. I did some checking and it turned out the battery had over 700 recharge cycles, which means the phone had been used for over two years. If possible, do not buy refurbished.",3
"Back camera doesn't work. I bought the cellphone to bring it out of the country as a gift and the camera doesn't work. Now It's too late to return. Embarrassing experience. Don't waste your time here. The cellphone also doesn't come inside an Apple box, no headphones nor original Apple charger.",1
The phone came as expected and it did not have anything wiring. The phone works perfectly and it was unlocked. We were able to go to metro pcs and have the devices switched over with no problem.,5
It's not what sold on your site. It's a locked Verizon phone. Not unlocked att phone as advertised. Wasted over two hours of my time. I bought this in good faith. They sucks,1
"Phone was unlocked upon purchase and worked fine until a restore caused it to restore to its locked status. SIM card no longer works in it. From the best I can tell, the provider unlocked the phone through hacking methods. Do not buy,",1
"The battery loses power incredibly fast. I do not have a lot of apps and I have nothing continually running in the background, so this tells me the battery just sucks",2
Would you not think a phone would work after 1 month of use. The ringer toggle quit working after having it for 31 days. Would like a replacement but they have a return policy of 30 days. I think they know more about the garbage they are selling then they let on.,1
"The on/off button sticks so it's hard to lock the phone, also the battery doesn't hold its charge well. I think that's a common problem with iPhones . It can go instantly from 60% to 20% and then from 20% to zero and turn off completely.",2
This product are not certified. Mine came with a pink shadow in the back light. I don't have time to return it because I need to send it overseas today. Bad product,1
it sucks and i will never buy a phone on amazon again it freeze a lot it doesn't s work you can hear it was ringing. I do not recommend it this person.,1
"The battery is useless, I have to almost always have it on a charger and it doesn't qualify for the free swap out. The mic that a phone call and snapchat use doesn't work, and it has a horrible time picking up Wifi. This was good in a pinch, but I wish I'd saved my money up and bought one from Apple.",2
The Apple IPhone 5 didn't meet my expectations it's keep on going off and on.The iPhone is always warm.I thought it's a new IPhone 5.I don't like this phone it's given me so many problems right now.The Watch is ok Bt d IPhone 5 is not in good condition. The charger can't recharge d IPhone 5,1
The phone is almost new in the outside and functions perfectly. The only drawback on my side is that the battery is very weak but of course I couldn't expect everything on the phone to be perfect for half its price so overall I am very happy with my Iphone :-),5
"This phone was derived like new, could not see the difference between a new phone and this one. I have been using it for more than 6 months now and I have no complains.",5
"This product is FAKE. It did not work when I bought it. I bought it it when I was in USA, but offered it to my daughter who lives abroad. It did not charge and looked fake.",1
"Phone is fine but TMobile reduced band width for i5 unlocked phones resulting in no 4G data access in our area , display ""E"" according to my grandaughter.",5
"Everything was great except the camera shutter is hard wired to never be silenced. It is a Japanese phone so it will always have a shutter noise with every photo taken, even with screenshots and in other apps. Personally this annoys me to no end.",1
Bought this for my daughter who had her brand new IPhone stolen. Phone looks good but battery only lasts one hour. When I tried to call Amazon they could not give me sellers direct info. Said they can contact seller for me. 15 minutes later still on the phone waiting for a solution from Amazon. Amazon is not standing by this product,1
"So disappointed! The entire screen had a yellow ring around it making the display horrible. Every corner and the back of the phone was dinged and scratched... the sim card holder was bent too. Everything that could be wrong with it, was.",1
came to me with the home button broken and had many problems with trying to charge the phone fixed that 30$ later and has now just broke after 4 months of use. Was not dropped or treated badly in anyway,1
"Phone looked great but when I tried to activate the SIM card it wouldn't take any card I put in it. Tried three different carriers, the return was pretty smooth.",2
It said comparable to AT&T but I received a Verizon Apple iPhone. And it keeps dying at random times first time my phone was at 30% yesterday it was 52% nor today at 40%.,1
Product is not function properly. Ringtone was not loud and could not hear anyone on speaker. Other minor issues. Sent phone backk to Amazon for refund.,2
"The iPhone was clear and in good shape as described by the seller. However, the power button on the iPhone was kinda hard and difficult to use. It doesn't go off at first press, you have to hold it down for few seconds to lock screen. Aside that it's in good shape and works just fine.",4
It did not work. It would not keep a password. I changed my apple password 6 times. I took the phone to tmobile they couldn't figure it out they told me to take it to apple. They couldn't get it to remember a password either. I sent back last Monday.,1
I bought this phone for my husband to replace an old iphone 4 with a cracked lens. Needless to say...he loves his new phone. It arrived and was just as advertised. Screen looks great and phone works great. He has had it now for several weeks and will not part with it. I will be purchasing from this vendor again. THANK YOU!,5
I bought this in black for my 14 year old. We use the Wal-Mart family mobile plan and so far she says everything works perfectly. She has had this phone for about a week now.,4
"Like the design and features of the iPhone 5. I purchased a refurb model that was not on the battery recall list, but clearly has serious battery life issues. I am returning it - hooray for Amazon's return policy - and will purchase a new one from a different Amazon vendor.",2
The phone was in great condition turned on and work in initially as expected but then again glitches turn off without any kind of warning however it was returned it easily without any kind of problem which I believe is a plus for the vendor so I rated it at least a 4 star,4
"This unlocked iPhone 5 that I bought is a really nice iPhone, I'm happy I decided to upgrade my phone. Hopefully the next person that orders one gets a good battery because the one that was in my iPhone 5 was shot so now I have ordered a replacement battery.",5
"cant make calls without loud static in the background, problem with the mic on the dock connector that used during calls, can only hear calls on speaker",2
You sold me a phone with a dead battery in it an iPhone 5 that I spent over $200 on the product was for an autistic teenager now after I get his arm fixed from him doing a massive fit because the battery only last an hour at a f****** time I will make sure you get it back are we clear on this thank you,1
Charge accessories are bootleg copies with Apple stamp. Confirmed by Apple technician. Christmas gift. So far phone is functioning well for 24 hours. This vendor cannot be trusted as I paid for the charging accessories. Had to buy a real Apple charger.,1
"It was not an AT&T phone it was a Verizon phone. Anyways it worked, but the refurb was mediocre at best. There were a lot of scratches on the phone. It was not aesthetically pleasing as I'd hoped.",3
"The iPhone 5 is great. No scratches and everything turned out well. I wish it had a tool where I could open up the SMS card holder/opening. Overall, I love my new phone. I'm just having trouble with Siri.",4
"The phone the you guys send me doesn t worl good, the botton in the top doesnt work and you can not shut down complete it because you can turn on again.. we turn on the phone and then the botton on the top didn t work to turn off. Apple told us in aventura mall miami that they can t fix it.",2
It didn't come with a charger so I had to go buy that.This is a new phone for me because I've never had iPhone.No instructions as how to set up.I would buy from this dealer again but I'll always ask more guestions.,4
"Got the package and was surprised that the iphone had no scratches. It really looked new! The phone plan set up was virtually effortless; it was very easy, and all of the functions were exceptional. I am satisfied with this purchase.",5
"I received the phone and placed it on charge. After it was fully charged, it started shutting down. It has been doing that very frequently. I have to continue turning it back on.",1
Phone says it's unlocked will only work on wifi the phone is a version phone and will not sync with my AT&T plan. Can only make calls without wifi. On description it did not say what company phone is from,1
"This phone sucks, the battery dies every second so I have to keep charging it every second of the day and a big waste of money, DONT BUY FROM 3rd PARTY SELLERS",1
"This phone was supposed to be a refurbished phone, but it worked for only a month before it began to fail in different areas. Fortunately, the Amazon return policy allowed us to get our money back. We've had iPhones in the past that worked great, but not this one....",2
Best deal ever! Got it because my son broke his screen. This was in EXCELLENT condition and 32GB! And the best part it wasn't expensive. Drove him back to school and we listened to music plus got turn by turn directions. I have just a generic cellphone. Actually thinking about getting an IPhone if I can find one from this provider!,5
Phone was in poor condition... The Screen Had several scratches.. It was scuffed... The battery could hold a charge.. It went from 100% to 20% in less than 30min.... So I ended up paying $120 for new battery & screen and other cosmetics...,1
Wasn't white and battery dies very quickly. Have disabled everything and the battery still dies within a couple hours. If I use Siri or wifi or Bluetooth battery drains in minutes.,1
It came broken. Battery is overheating. Home button doesn't work. It was a gift and it was sent far away so I can't return it anymore. Very disappointed!,1
"I like the looks and that it was unlocked. But it doesn't connect at all to wifi. The battery doesn't hold a charge for even a day. The clock is off by an hour. But the phone and messaging works. So basically I just bought a very expensive phone, since that is all it is good for! Refurbished isn't really accurate.",1
Good phone. No problems with appearance or operation. I had to replace the battery within a few months. Mildly inconvenient but not expensive or a big deal really. I felt I received a good value.,4
Phone does not work. The internal speaker is defective. only speaker phone works for hearing phone calls. AlsoSent with charger for an iPhone 4. So can not charge with it. Probably just spend for a repair after the time invested in reinstalling everything.,1
I love my new refurbished Iphone 5s!!! I believe I got a really good deal from Amazon. My phone was in great condition when I received it. It didn't come with the original charger or base but other than that I haven't had any problems so far! 👍🏽,5
"Phone works fine, but the battery isn't great. Just have to keep a charger on you. Other than that, you would never know this was a refurbished phone.I feel like it is slightly overpriced for just being a 5 and being refurbished. I should have bought the 5S new for about 20$ more.",3
"I was very impressed with the phone I purchased. We have had no issues with the phone, and it looked brand new. I would use this seller again. It arrived on time, and was packaged very well. Im surprised you could get a phone in this condition for so cheap.",5
"This is our 2nd iPhone 5 from this seller. The first phone came with almost no battery life, but was pleasantly returned & replaced. The replacement phone has more limited battery life than I would like, but not nearly as bad as the original.",4
"DONT BUY IT keep you time ""Refurbished NEW "" UFFF yea people rigth about the battery only 1 hour hold battery 100% to 0 WATH what is tha No good for the price 200$ Naaa is used scratch dent dirty Naaa Of course I return",1
"battery and battery indicator were both defective; it would not charge beyond 77% after the first day and after 10 minutest of stand-by, the charge was at 17%; then after a few minutes of use the charge indicated 3%; then it went to 42% for a few minutes and turned off; i tried resetting it but no improvement; an awful experience;",1
said it was factory refurbished the battery will not hold a charge I had already installed a glass screen protector which cost $40 and didn't want to spend another 40.00 on another screen protector so I had battery replaced by Apple. Not happy,1
The phone we received had problems from the beginning. Finally took it in to an Apple store and they verified that it wasn't an Apple phone. Buyer beware.,1
"Phone had bad phone speaker, issues with the battery life indicater (either has full battery or 1%, nothing in between). Seller offered a refund/replacement and was cool, I just couldn't be without a phone for 2-4 weeks.",2
I didn't check when it arrived and I send them to India .one is working fine but other is asking for PIN number .Not able to use that phone.what to do.,1
I was trying to communicate with you. I bought this apple but when I using the phone after 10-15 minutes the battery don't work. To restart again it takes long hour. May I return it?,1
"This is a replacement and upgrade to a previous version. The price was affordable and given my past experience as a iPhone holder, as well as iPhone's sterling track record, I know I'd get good mileage from this item. I'm very happy with my purchase.",4
I received a phone that was already activated and locked so i had to wait an extra week and a half for a new phone. The second time around everything was perfect as far as I can tell.,4
"We ordered two phones, recovered them yesterday. One is fine thus far, mine you can't hear out of and people can't hear you and if you or they can it echoes.",2
"This phone purchase has been most acceptable and has worked perfectly since day one. Thrilled to have it, have GSM network and aboslutely no problems! Like brand new, would buy again from this seller if needed. Thank you so much, my daughter is thrilled with her upgrade.",5
"Don't buy this iPhone, the battery doesn't work well and I have to charge the phone every hour, the iPhone also works very slow , I really really don't recommend you to buy this iPhone, I don't wanna give this post a star but I have to, so I can share my experience I had with this iPhone",1
"Nice phone 🤔 Only thing I dislike is the first two days I had it it died before it hit 0 % 😑 , after that it haven't done that . And it's now holding a charge 😛",5
"The phone was sent to me with a faulty battery. The battery drained in less than an hour, so I had to take it to the Apple Store fo the battery to be replaced. So ended up paying additional money to fix a certified refurbished phone!",1
"I amvery disappointed that only after just purchasing the item for 5 months the battery for my I5 Model A1429 has gone bad. This will cause me to have to replace the battery, LCD Screen Display with Digitizer Touch Panel. How can I get in touch with the supplier?Apple iPhone 5 32GB Factory Unlocked GSM Cell Phone - Black (Certified Refurbished)",2
"I'm so happy that the product arrived sooner than expected. The phone itself it's fine. My only concern is that the battery seems to not last what's supposed to. However, comparing this price to the original it's way cheaper and I'm considering going to the Apple store and changing the battery there. My mobile carrier is AT&T and it works fine.",4
"Battery is faulty. Dealfinder was great at communicating, and did offer me the 30 day return option, but I had waited so long to get the phone that I've decided to purchase a replacement battery and replace it on my own. Phone works great besides the bad battery.",4
"The phone was supposed to be unlocked, but it wasn't. Only accepted either Att SIM card or T mobile. Battery lasted 4 hours with no use even less if In use. I would never recommend a used phone. Just save yourself time and money buy new",1
Phone is working fine and everything works fine . But the charger and charger cable provided is not working properly .Battery last only one day maximum . I am not sure that's about other iPhone 5 battery and if all iPhone 5 are like that then that is fine.,3
The keys and icons on the extreme right portion of the touch screen don't function properly. need to reload the phone every time when it doesn't work. I would like to return this phone and exchange it with other I-phone of same kind.,2
The phone looks nearly new and very well taking care. Everything works great and I couldn't be more happier. I went to Metro PCS and put the sim in and transferred my number to it without any issues. The 4G LTE is great on here all in and around the Houston Tx area,5
"Ordered this not realizing it wasn't meant to be used with Virgin Mobile, but Virgin Mobile was able to somehow ""convert"" it to be used on their network. Doing this was relatively easy and they sent us a new SIM card for free. The phone is working great and we've not had any complaints.",5

Product arrived in good external condition and on-time. Upon turning it on I quickly realized that battery life is not what it should be. The battery lasted roughly 20minutes on a full charge.,1
Crap phone. Hardly holds a charge. Frame of the phone was actually bent as if someone had kept it in thier back pocket and sat on it constantly. Won't buy from this seller again.,2
"Within a week the phone would not turn on , when hooked up to I tunes it would not allow me to reset it either . I could reset out her phones so I know it wasn't the computer or I tunes , it was the phone . Hopefully this is just a fluke and others do not have this issue with this company .",1
"Got the phone in record time and it was everything advertised via seller. This phone is definitely a keeper too with my mixtape case. 🤘🏽It has more than enough space for my songs, baby pictures and notes. Still using it 6/27/16",5
"Nice phone. I do everything on it--shopping lists, workout videos, emails. What can't this thing do? Oh, and it's now my main camera I make collages and videos with--Magisto app is great!",5
"This phone first off was shipped promptly and packaged very nicely. The phone has been working really well except sometimes while texting it will glitch out to where it won't type or type wrong letters. For the price it's a great phone, thank you!",4
"The phone's appearance is great as what's been said on the description. However, im having problems with the sound. Sometimes when it play a video, it wont make a sound..and it types incorrectly most of the time. :(",2
"I got this 5 iphone with 64 gb of storage as a gift for my SO, he loves it. I got it at a great price from the seller green earth. I took it to get it unlocked, so the value will be even better. you can't beat the price and shipping.",5
"This phone looked great however, it would not stay on unless it was plugged in. But Amazon has great customer service and reimbursed me and we shipped it back for free. Another phone was purchased and it works great!",3
"All the buttons will not function correctly. The volume button is not working. The on and off button sometimes works, but sometimes doesn't. The front camera is not working, either.",2
Great phone the provides all the services I expect. Am happy to have it. Works great but will have to unlock it so I can use it on my service provider. Thanks,5

Misrepresentation of product poor quality control! Would never buy another product from supplier! Have bought two fphones and a friend of mine bought one phone and all had the same exact failures!,1
Phone is in great shape. It has a slighty erratic battery at low charges(which is a issue with this model). The Bluetooth doesn't work which isn't a issue for me. Price was great. Satisfied,4
"Saved some money over buying a new phone. Looked like new, preforms like new. Must be like new. Smaller than the 6 just the right size for the pocket. and the wallet too.",5
"I love this phone. It is very lightweight with improved resolution and camera quality. The 64GB version leaves A LOT of space for music, photos, apps, etc. I used to own an iPhone 4S, and this is definitely an improvement. If you're looking for an affordable, spacious, durable phone, this is it.",5
The device is perfect but it is locked with AT&T as advertised. But the SIM card is not included in the package and also the AT&T Contact is still not finished. So I cannot use the phone with another SIM.,1
The battery on this used phone does not last 4 hours and at 40% the phone shuts off. Will take it to service to replace the battery. If that does not help will have to return it. Many sources report problems with iphone 5 battery life,2
A little over a month and it doesnt even stay on for more then 5 mins im pretty unhappy that i spent so much money of this refurbished phone to soon enough not work. it may have worked for the first 40 days after that the battery is just shot.,1
"I love my phone. I was a little worried because I bought it used, but I was impressed when I received it. It looks almost new and so far it is working excellent.",5

The phone was in great condition. I can only find one little mark on the case. The phone has been working fine with AT&T. I'm very happy with this purchase.,5

Pretty good for the price. I had some problems with my first one but was able to return it for a refund and got another. The seccond had some dings but nothing that effected the way it functions. Overall good buy.,4

I had the iPhone 4 for over two years. I was good. The 5 is amazing. Super fast and screen resolution and camera pictures are insanely clear. I have the 64 gb and put 13 movies on it and I haven't even used half of the phones memory yet. Def get it,5

"I love my new iPhone. I would have given it a 5, but it came with a recalled battery that I have to replace at my expense through the Apple Store. Because I did not purchase through Apple, the product warrant is not available.",4

"This was the worst purchase I made on Amazon. Bad phone! After a few months of service, phone used to restart with 20% of battery charge remaining, the screen used to freeze a couple of times a day, the charging port was loose, so the cable had to be moved around for it to charge. Bad, bad!",1
"I'm so glad I opted for 64GB, it makes everything so much less stressful. I'm a little annoyed Apple for unhelpfully rearranging the Music app, but overall for the price ($180) it's well worth it.",5
"The phone is nice..... Although My callers have a hard time hearing me, I just plug in headphones and that stops the problem.P.s. I didn't read the description correctly and thought it was a 5s but like I said it was my error.",3

"Fantastic phone, also, the seller always kept me inform of what was going on, and when shipping was to take place. Having 64gb available is great for pics, updates, videos, etc. Add an extended battery and you can get about 15 to 18 hours of moderate to heavy usage out of this phone without charging.",5
Pretty good for the price. I had some problems with my first one but was able to return it for a refund and got another. The seccond had some dings but nothing that effected the way it functions. Overall good buy.,4
"Love this purchase! Thank you so much, it even came with a warranty. The phone was exactly as described and worked even with international carriers. It's probably one of the most beneficial purchases I've had on Amazon.",5
"WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL.. got the phone before they said I would and it was PERFECT. I was nervous buying a phone in this manner but, I was worried for nothing. The phone was great and the seller was fast, honest and had a great product. I AM SOOOOOO HAPPY.",5
"Good phone, but for some reason the touch functioning in the screen is messed up. If it continues I'll have it replaced and right a new review. 5 stars if the screen was working fully",3
"All bad. Falsely described. Dents, scratches (like sanding paint completely off on sides), dirt, and a lot of chipping. Was completely under described.",1
"Yes, it was used. However, you would never know it without me telling you. It is in awesome shape and works like a charm! I had to get a page plus cellular SIM card but after that it works fine on their network! Very happy with this purchase!",5
"I love my new iPhone. I would have given it a 5, but it came with a recalled battery that I have to replace at my expense through the Apple Store. Because I did not purchase through Apple, the product warrant is not available.",4
This phone had information on it from the previous owner and it was very disturbing when I was told it was from Apple but it had a fry brothers box and item number.,2
"Bought this iPhone 5 as a replacement phone for Verizon. I needed to upgrade to but did not want to lose my unlimited data. Purchased on June 23, received on June 25. Activated without a hitch.",5
The phone is in great shape very happy known Nick's dings or cracks almost like new. Except that the battery life is extremely short. Having to charge at least 2 to 3 times per day I guess I'll have to get a new battery.,2
"I have waited my entire life for this IPhone 5 and to-date, I never received it. I contacted the Seller 5-6 times and She responded once . I still didn't received my iPhone5. I filed a claim with Amazon and is presently waiting for my money to be credited to my account!",1
Bought this for our daughter for Christmas. I was a little nervous but it worked great with her plan. This iPhone is great and she loved it. She had an iPhone 4 before and this is so much more intuitive. It really is worth upgrading.,5
"the phone was described as unlocked and it was locked had to pay money to unlock,this was very miss leading,never had a problem with amazon until I bought from this dealer,had to go to many stores before I could use this phone. not satisfied with this at all",2
Awfull iphone came with broken battery i have to replace it. Such a scame! Unfortunaly i waste the money And i cant return because im Out of usa.I always shop in amazon but this was so dessapoitend,1
"The worse thing I've ever bought, I was sent the wrong phone then they tried to tell me I bought a completely different thing. Does not hold a charge and the charger already quit working. I would advise everyone to stay clear.",1
"This phone came in like new condition. My daughter loves it! I did have to send it to Apple to replace the power button as it was a known defect in some of the iPhone 5 phones, but it was repaired and shipped back within a week and free of charge.",5
Phone came with more scratches then expected and after a day or two of use the back camera has these tiny purple specks on every picture you take while using the back camera.,4
The phone is in great condition but the battery dies 15 minutes after being fully chartered.. I feel ripped off. I wish I could get a refund or exchange cause I have all the stuff even the box...,1
Very professional. Fast response to email. Super fast shipping. I don't think this phone is new but it looks pretty good. It did come in the original box but it has some signs that it's not new. Also it's not unblocked! Accessories are brand new!,4
I can not use the this phone because it is currently linked to an Apple ID to its original owner.This phone is stolen or the original owner didn't remove the device from his account. PHONE IS USELESS!!!,1
"The item arrived a couple of days ahead of delivery date which was great because it was a late Christmas gift for my granddaughter who was in need of a new phone. However, the charger that came with the phone does NOT work!!!!",3
The seller is actually a great individual to speak with but I think he just need to be more specific with the item he is trying to sell as well as more details.,3
"The seller advertised this as brand new, fully checked and having no problems. However, the front facing camera has never worked and will cost over $60 to fix. Other than missing the front camera, the phone is great.",1
"T Mobile dealer unlocked and fix it,right now I can use it,but I paid 40 dollars for them.The battery too weak no can keep long time only 24 hours I must recharge.",3
"I wanted to buy an iphone and was a good choice . New and quality product. For those who want an iphone , I recommend . Just missed the key to open the place to put the chip .",5
"This phone sucks, the charger doesn't work, the phone dies way to fast and the batter is insufficient, the phone constantly needs to be charged and it switched my 4g to 3G",1
dear sir :i have not use my iphon5 because it is on contract until July 2014 or 2015 so is blocked to be use outside of the USA.i do not recommend buying any cellular phone in AMAZON.,1
It arrived with a bunch of stickers and such on the back of it. I took some baby shampoo and cleaned it up nice. Wish someone would have done that before sending it. I panicked for a minute.,2
"I really like the phone I got, works perfectly! The order was shipped in a good amount of time. I thought it was going to take longer to get it but I got it right away.",4
My 2nd Iphone 5 this year.Bought this one for my Dad who travels a lot so that we can facetime anytime.I won't upgrade for the coming 5s or 5c...they never disappointed me.,5
I love this phone! It was such an easy transaction and was promptly shipped! It was brand new and works perfectly. Its so fast compared to my iphone 4. So glad I made the switch! Thank you!,5
I ordered an Iphone unlocked and it was not like that. I had to unlock it myself (I had to pay for it). The speaker as well as th hand set don`t work properly. I can bearly have a proper conversation on the Phone.,1
"It worked okay for the first week and a half or so. Then the power button stops working. It literally will lock by itself, or the power screen will come on. Then at one point, the LCD got messed up but it somehow returned to normal. But I'm too scared to keep this phone if after only 2 weeks it breaks down this badly.",1
from blackberry to iphone. I researched this over a long period of time. Nothing but positives. Saved hundreds of dollars not buying from my cellular carrier.,5
"I took the phone to Apple Store because it would not accept the SIM card. Per the Apple Tech, the phone had long term liquid damage. I returned the phone and received a full reimbursement.",1
The phone is locked which is not clear in specification. In reviews one review says it works with all companies which is not true. This is a deception. Unfortunately is is fulfillment by Amazon,1
"BUY this phone, it is the best i phone yet. Faster, bigger and better. Siri is way better than the 4s and this phone can do allot more stuff. Would recommend to everyone.",5
Best used item I've ever bought!!!!! Way better then I even expected and had NO PROBLEMS with activation. Just remember to purchase a SIM card with this phone!!!!! LOVE MY PHONE!!!,5
"I bought this phone claiming that it was ""new"" in the full description, and as I had a gut feeling which I should have listened to, the phone came in with lots of cosmetic wear and light yet noticeable scratches on the glass screen. However, the internals worked fine.",2
"We went from a flip phone to this iphone and were a bit nervous about the learning curve. As it turns out, it wasn't as bad as we antiipated and it works as it should.",5
"This phone arrived quickly and in better shape than they reported.One has to be skeptical for tech devices, but I felt very comfortable after receiving the product and would definitely order from them again.",5
I bought this phone as a AT&T phone but when I went to AT&T to get started I found out it was only works with t moble.. I needed phone so I just get a t moble pay as you go plan. But phone itself is working great so I'm happy with my purches !,4
"Phone was listed as new, it came refurbished and didn't even work! It would NOT charge. It did NOT come with a sim card. The volume buttons were broken! The box was banged up!",1
the phone was excellent brand new the case was weird inside the usual phone holder did not fit the charger did not work i need to get new ones but the i phone itself was what i expected.,4
"Very good product from the sender. It's everything that is expected, and should be expected from a refurbished product. I just didn't anticipate how much I'd dislike iOS.",4
"Seller did not let me return the phone, and after about a month I bought it, the phone literally died and the batter is dead, forever. Should have never bought this phone, caused me so much stress.",1
"BUY this phone, it is the best i phone yet. Faster, bigger and better. Would recommend to everyone. I bought this for a high school student and loves it.",5
The phone itself was really good and just as described but unfortunately I'm having problems connecting with wifi. I've looked it up and apparently it's happened on a lot of iPhone 5's,3
"The battery sucks. One minute I'm on 100% and a couple of minutes later, I'm on 37%. I can barely enjoy my phone because the battery is very messed up so NOW I have to spend more money buying a battery replacement kit. The phone is in good condition but glitches are very obvious. smh",2
First the phones battery was terrible hadn't been replaced since 2012 and the barely could stay alive. Other than that the phone was good. Next time I'll read over the description better.,3
"Phone was in amazing condition on the outside but just a few months in to the phone everything went bad ! First it was the battery , then the screen, lastly the phone did not even want to start ! Waste of 205$",1
they considered it in good condition it was actually in excellent condition just one little scuff mark on the back and I had it before 12 noon the next day can't beat that I have recommend them already and will order again very pleased,5
The phone had no home button the phone was locked and couldn't use it. Picture on Amazon did not match the product screen has punctures in it as well. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT,1
"This came defective from the seller. Battery drains at an alarming rate and the whole phone shuts off at between 20% and 30% power. Not sure where this seller got it from, but clearly a bad unit.",1
"shipped and arrived in a timely manner. But, phone is almost new and the screen is already cracked. Not high quality material. Phone fell out my pants pocket from the standing position. I didnt expect it to break the first time I dropped it. I've dropped other brand phones several times and Ive never had a screen break before this iPhone.",3
Phone was not what was advertised. The back camera was broken so is the screen. And the phone glitches also has two white lines on it. Please do not buy from this carried.,2
"Phone works for the most part. Freezes occassionally and has minimal damage, but this is expected from a refurbished phone. You get what you pay for. Overall, I am satisfied with the value derived from the price I paid.",4
I was not happy with this product. The phone would not stay charged and also the the phone was broke. I had to take it to a third party to have the problems fixed. It cost me an extra $100 Not happy at all,1
"I am beyond impressed with my phone I received. Perfect condition. Fast shipping, great quality. Everything about it is perfect. Thank you. Order today, you won't be sorry!",5
This phone is amazing..I was a little skeptical when I ordered it but I must say its great. The shipping was very fast. The phone functions great and in great condition. I would recommend this phone to everyone.,5
"The article said 5s this is not a 5s it's just a 5. Disappointed, but it's still a working phone. It also was not in excellent condition like the article said.",3
"I ordered a iPhone 5 Unlocked AT&T For my GrandaughterWhat I got was a IPhone 5 unlocked Sprint Phone,I had to return it for an Amazon Gift Card whichTies up my money's until I get the gift card,",1
"Absolutely terrible; huge headache. Phone was advertised as new however I have had many issues since purchase including the chargeport and battery being ""dead"" causing me to purchase new ones. Now my phone won't allow me to type adequately, as it seems like it's possessed and just types random letters and clicks random apps.",1
"While we love the iPhone--it was purchased through Amazon Warehouse Deals and came with a useless battery. Though it is 'backed by the return policy"" it is basically not any safer than buying through craigs list or ebay. buyer beware--its a gamble. :)",2
I have always been an android user and decided to try the iPhone. I love it!!The phone looks brand new. No scratches and works great.Fast shipping arrived several days before due date.Would recommend this seller.,5
I got this ring for someone very special to me and she loves it beyond belief. Its so pretty and it does not leave any sort of green marks whatsoever. Shes worn it in water and stuff and its fine! Im really happy too bc every princess needs princess ring (: 10/10 would suggest getting! The shipping was sooner than expected as well!,5
"Never been a huge fan of iPhones since I was able to escape the brainwashing after the 3GS. Only purchased this for my mother in law who, like all eastern Europeans, love anything apple because it's ""premium"". The truth is, the iPhone 5 is an outdated, small phone that's very overpriced on the market.",2
I wld give mre stars becuz it came in perfect condition bt my issue is that the charger doesnt work properly wen i plug it in the fone it says cable is unstable?,3
"Product worked. However, camera was broken. Big huge blob in middle of all images. Very unhappy with this, after going through the trouble of activation.",1
"Got my phone within 4 or 5 days after ordering. Its in great condition almost perfect, not a single scratch. The battery lasts forever and phone came with a 30 day warranty! Would definitely recommend to someone looking to buy one. Usually don't do reviews but had to for this one!",5
"Great phone for a great price. I got it because my iphone 4 kept messing up and i needed a working phone. All in all this phone works alot better than my old one, and it got to me within a few days. Altogether i am pleased.",5
Beyond happy with my purchase. The phone was just as described & almost like new. As soon as it arrived I Inserted my SIM card and got it working ASAP with no complications.,5
"This is a review for Mango Wireless not the iPhone. After buying several phones on Amazon that we said to be ""new"" but were refurbished or used, I finally got one that appears to actually be new!! Nice job Mango Wireless on selling what you advertise!",5
"Do NOT buy from RESELLCEL. I wish i could give less than one star for this product. Phone didn't last one month!!! After a few weeks the battery was completely dead and the phone wouldn't turn on. I wasted $50 dollars on a new battery, and a few days after the phone completely shut down. I contacted RESELLCEL and they were not able to fix my phone.",1
"The phone was perfect, except the button to lock the screen didn't work. Everything else was fine, it was just irritating to not be able to use it. We are going to Apple to fix it.",4
"Good condition, works fine, however the headphone jack is damaged and when either headphones or an aux cord is plugged in, music sounds like nothing but static. Can't really give it higher because I now have to spend more money fixing a problem. Other than that, it's a fairly decent phone for the price.",3
"First off, it took forever to get here. And then only a couple weeks later the screen has started to come off and it completely distorts the image. Not worth the money, never ordering again.",1
"Bought 2 of these, one for me and one for my mom. I love the iPhone, but everything is defaulted to an Asian language, and my mom's phone crashed within 6 months. She took it in to her service store, and they couldn't even fix it.",2
I bought this a little over a month ago and I haven't had any problems whatsoever. I was a little sketched out about buying a phone online but I couldn't be more satisfied!,5
The phone is in much better condition than I expected. It's not fantastic at connecting to the internet but I might just be getting bad reception because of my area. Fast shipping and painless process.,5
It was the perfect phone when i opened the package... It was like new.. The bad thing is that they have to call me twice for my phone to ring.. If they call once my phone would just say i have a missed call.. But great deal:),4
"iPhone works perfectly. Did not come with the tray that holds the SIM card, but I had one from my old phone. The iPhone was in perfect condition and looks and works as if brand new. Overall I am very satisfied with this purchase.",5
"This phone arrived quickly and in better shape than they reported.One has to be skeptical for tech devices, but I felt very comfortable after receiving the product and would definitely order from them again.",5

"The phone I received did not work well. I bought it to replace my broken phone right before I went on a trip, and by the time I returned it was too late to return it. But I wished I could.",2
Wow Its NOT ORIGINAL!!! Bought this Iphone 2 years ago but the battery start to fail so I take it to the Apple store to recycle with a new one but attendant checked the serial number and SURPRISEEE they didnt recognize as an apple product.... Its fake.,1
I brought this phone in September and it stopped working in October it was a brand new and all the accessories are non genuine. Please save your money and do not buy this phone. They only haven one month warranty. BIG WASTE OF MY MONEY PLEASE DON'T BUY.,1
"The phone had a passcode. I took it an Apple store near me, only to find that it is not really unlocked. Do yourselves a favor and STAY AWAY from this seller!!!",1
"Another great product from Amazon Marketplace. Newer iphones are faster, but for the money (not retail price) don't forget the 5! I use for business, and have no problem running the apps, or staying connected.",4
"todo muy bien,perfecto ,era todo como lo esperaba muchas gracias,100% lo mejor ,DIOS le bendiga......excelente, excelente, agradecido y muy conforme con todo",5
"Excelente producto, aunque las diferencias con la versión anterior es poca.Entrega totalmente a tiempo, 100% recomendado.Van a disfrutar bastante de este excelente teléfono inteligente",5
"MUY BUEN TELEFONO LO USO CON MOVISTAR AQUI EN VENEZUELA Y LA SEÑAL SE VA EN ALGUNAS PARTES, HAY QUE PROBAR CON DIGITEL A VER. ESTOY EN VALENCIA SALUDOS EXCELENTE TELEFONO.",5
"I used the Galaxy S3 for 5 months and Android is much better than iOS, but the samsung hardware is disgusting. Apple still rock it and iphone 5 prove that.",5
It's everything you come to expect from apple. Aluminum build quality is very solid. Beveled edges tend to get easily chipped though so buy a case. The wifi can be suspect at times. This may be a software issue or more likely the result of the aluminum design. Apps load very quickly. No stutter at all with this phone.,5
"I've been happy with this phone - I've had it for about a month now and there hasn't been a single problem. It works great, the battery life is good; no complaints at all.",4
yea I got what I ordered and my niece loves it!! she thinks she is the bee knees now lol. it is exactly what it says it is. did not have any problems.,5
was supposed to be unlocked why did I get a phone that cant recognize my tmobile sim card??? double checked on here that it said it would work for tmobile before spending 140$ yet here I am with a disappointing product.....,1
This was perfectly authentic. My phone does usually die around 5-9% however but that's fine since it is a used phone and little things like that are to be expected. I stuck this baby in an otterbox and stuck a glass screen protector on it. Awesome purchase!,5
"The phone stop working in a month (Starts fine than when the phone is on it turns white completely, i even let it like that for 2hours before it shut down) and my refund request was denied.",1
"Bought used from Ecok-Tokyo. It came device only, no headphone or charger. The iphone had some small dings around the metallic rim but the screen, back case and buttons were in excellent condition. Turned on ok and phone prompted for setup. So, vendor had cleaned and reset the phone before selling it.",4
Product worked great as soon as I got it out the box and charged. The item looked brand new and all items that would have been sent in an original package was there also. Really can't complain about this phone and I'm just hoping I don't break it like my other ones.,5
"The problem that the device is unlocked but when I travel to Saudi Arabia I tried to put my sim card in some places the works very well but in another the device give me no signal, and the LTE doesn't work in Saudi Arabia",3
These are the type of people who make you not want to buy anything on-line. I lost 500 dollars and will never trust buying on-line again. This is the type of seller who makes it difficult for other who are just starting out. I just can not express how much this seller should be in jail.,1
Received product in excellent condition. I like the apple phone is much better than the Samsung S3 I have.Feels like I never missed my Apple Iphone 4S,5
The heading says it all. I bought a Galaxy S4 and thankfully the screen stopped working after two days so I want back to Apple. I have learned my lesson!,5
"The performance of this phone is really good. Awesome design, great features, slim, a bit heavy at times but you get used too. iPhone works flawlessly.",5
"the phone is very fast and fancy. feels light in your hands like u arent holding anything. I DONT KNOW IF is my phone alone but sometimes the wifi goes and comes back when i go to put it on but its on. so that's the only problem,",4
Extremly dissapointed. The item came with a non compatible charger and the phone itself has issues charging even when I use the priginal apple charger form my other Iphone 5. I have purchased as a gift and eventualy had to take it back because of the charging issue.,1
The iphone arrived well but with the surprise that I discovered that it was repaired in the past and badly assembled.The seller did not specify that detail. it was not in mint conditions,3
"This phone was great for the price . However it was a bit hard , getting it activated . It was damage on the edges . Nothing a phone case , couldn't hide though . Also for some reason it , doesn't receive picture mail .",4
"I'm surprise with this, new and no one scratch in the phone, really good price for 32gb, compare with the other store I save lot money for this, very happy",5
This phone was not what I expected at all! My phone at little dents all on the back and sides of ohone was chipped . This phone was s*** . Also it said unlocked iphone which it was not unlock and did not even come with a SIM card ! Very pissed off about this !,1
I received the iPhone 5C with plastic on the back instead of regular iPhone 5 . We thought that this product is apple iPhone 5 in silver and white color. But my friend said it's fine and she kept it since the price is considerable low,3
"It worked perfect. It was a gift to my daughter, (I'm team Android) and she loves it although I thought I was ordering the 5S ..It was my mistake. She was hurt at first, but now she loves that thing. 32 gigs is a lot. She wont be complaining about storage",5
"Phone worked good for the first month but the battery wouldn't last more than a day so I had to replace it. After 2 months the phone started acting a little ""buggy"". 5 months later now and I am looking to replace it because it's just too buggy.",2
Love it. Great quality for refurb. A few slim slight scratches mainly just on the back Apple reflector. Other than that it was like brand new. Great value with the 32 GB.,5
"iPhone does not work properly with AT&T as advertised. The strength of signal inside buildings drops to ''No Services"" while AT&T cell phone works in the same place well. I returned this item and bought iPhone at AT&T.",2
"Bought This July 2nd 2015. I've Had To Change The Battery Twice. Now Unfortunately Again The Battery Has Stopped Functioning, There's No Way The Batteries Have Such A Short Lifespan, This Phone Was Obviously Faulty.Also The Screen Has Stopped Working. I DO NOT Recommend Buying From This Seller At All.",1
"I purchased 2 of these, they arrived in 2 days! One is working perfect, one had a bad battery and had to be returned. They had my refund processed the same day! I will be ordering another one soon",4
- The headphones stopped working after a few moths- The touch screen doesn't always respond- The lock button stopped working almost immediately- Had to get SIM card tray replaced- Battery only lasts 10 hours with minimal useWhen I was first getting this p,1
"I receive my iPhone today....it look ok..got a few scratches, no headphones but it's a nice phone the only problem is the battery is damaged it won't stay on for a long time other than that it's ok but I don't like it because I got to keep it on the charger....BAD FOR BUSINESS!!!!!!",2
"The iPhone works fine. However the headphones broke in less than 2 weeks, the charging cable gives you the annoying message that it is not approved by apple so that is a bit wearing.",3
Works like new - no problems. A little crack on back cover but hardly noticeable. Works fine with T-mobile - just had to purchase a new sim card for $10.,4
"excellent very happy with the product received, I am satisfied with the purchase !!! really congratulate and excellent office !!! thank you very much ...",5
"The phone is brand new and working perfectly I would recommend anyone to buy their products with them , shipping was on time and everything comes in great conditions!! I'm happy with the phone",5
The phone came with some scratches in the back that weren't mentioned in the description. Also came with some photos and one of a naked man. Totally inappropiate. The delivery in perfect time.,4
The phone is great but it initially had battery problems. Apple fixed it and now it works great. But it was disappointing at first and should have been fixed before.,4
"The Iphone has scratches, scuffs on the sides, a lot of dust and dirt. In addition, the charger, cable box and headphones are not the originals. I am disgusted with purchase!!!",2
"The phone does work. However, the seller said that it had never been dropped and it clearly has. It had some pretty big gashes on one end of it. The screen was good though. The volume buttons don't want to work sometimes but so far, I've been able to mess with them until they do.",3
The phone does have minor wear n tear around the edges. Screen had no scratches. At first facetime wasn't working for me but then something kicked in everything has been working just perfect ever since. Not too bad a price nor product.,4
"I loved the fact that iphone has developed and covered most of its software-related issues in the iOS 7Also and most importantly, I see that iphone 5 is far better than 5C due to having an Aluminum case, while having same attributes.",5
"EQUIPMENT IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, THE CODE IMEI TEAM NO COINSIDE AL OF THE BOX MAKES DEBLOQUEADO FACTORY BUT IN THE CONFIGURATION OF EQUIPMENT BRAND AT & T, BUT IN VENEZUELA ME WORKED VERY WELL, NOT GOOD TO AMAZON VERIFIED PRODUCTS OFFERED BY SELLERS , THANK GOD IT WORKS LIKE THE CELL PHONE, I MEAN THAT YOU OPERATE AS SOME FRIENDS IPOD.",3
"I ordered an Unlocked Phone and a friend brought it to Africa where I work and when I got it here, found out it was locked. Had to send it back with another friend to get my money back.",1
The Iphone wasn`t unlocked..when I tried to use my sim card it says that it isn`t from a supported carrier .. when I contacted the seller he said ( it was unlocked when I sent it)..If he didn`t want to cooperate he will be charged by the law..,1
I put this phone personally to the Apple store they read the serial number and determined that this was a used phone and defective the phone would not power on would not take a charge state it online the phone was brand new never used that was completely a lie I am sending this phone back asap!,1
Itll be a year in April since Ive had this phone and im already having like BAD battery problems..when i first got it the back had a dent; i made the mistake of not looking at the reviews before i bought from this vendor and now i regret.,2
"The phone was in great condition, but it wasn't unlocked and would not work with my sim card. The company refunded my purchase but I've had to order a different phone. It could just be a one time problem, but I would not recommend it.",1
"good afternoonI make a reference question to my phone iphone 5, which acquired through you .. do four months my phone just gets the iphone logo that is on the apple which does not allow me access to the device functions .. .what can I do",1
"I purchased used from JP Mobiles LLC, and I couldn't be happier. After my last phone went swimming with the fishes, I needed to pick up another phone for use with T-Mobile. I love the feel of the iPhone 5, it definitely feels well built and classy. I used Android for awhile, but you just can't beat the simplicity offered by Apple.",5
My iPhone arrived in perfect condition as described. So happy with my purchase. I'm really pleased with this phone and all of it's features. Just insert my SIM card and.....ready to GO !,5
"The iphone was not in the perfect conditions I was expecting. A little dirty and some scratch. Also some troubles to get it charged. Appart from that I am happy with the purchase, for now...",3
Love this phone and it is deff worth the buy especially since it's at it's cheapest. I love the memory on it to. There is no way that you will use 32gb unless you takes selfies everyday lol.,5
my phone dies randomly without being on low battery. probably a battery connectivity problem but it works when plugged into a charger. Not willing to pay for another one though #cheapo,2
The phone had scratches as said it would. It worked fine. However the problem I had was the charger cord stopped working after a week or two. I received new ones after contacting them about that.,4
"First of all it came without a charger, which is deceiving. Second, the battery sucks! The phone keeps dying on me after just a couple hours - I can't have it plugged in all the time! Seriously disappointed by the quality of the phone.",1
"Callers cannot hear me on this phone unless I have it on speaker. It's a shame I spent this much money on a phone that I can only use if I put people on speaker. That's what I get for buying used, I guess. Won't happen again.",2
This is absolutely garbageAlso battery has very big problemIt's finished 3 min from chargingAlso I ordered iPhone 5 with 32 gband I got iPhone 5 16gbThat's not normal !!!!!!!,1
The company made a good job. I received the phone quickly.My daughter wanted this phone. I am still searching to find a significant difference between her previous iphone to pay so much Money.,3
"As usual, Apple make an extraordinary gadget with great presentation, nice design, awesome speed and very nice user interface.Excellent productI love it",5
"Although in the long run this phone turned out okay, it took some expert tweaking to make it so. The settings ought to have been returned to the default before it was sold. As for appearance, it was ""like new.""",3
"I bought a used iPhone 5, 32GB, and am very happy with it. I've had it for a month and haven't run into any issues. Did not come with headphones, but included charger.",4
"Terrible product! Phone freezes way too much, it dies with nearly 35-45% battery remaining. Many apps do not work properly that include using the camera. Very disappointed with the seller and this product. Will not be receiving my business again.",1
I guess you could just say I'm jealous because I have the 4S and this 5 was perfectly wrapped from Apple UNLOCKED! And it works fine with Walmart Family Mobile which I highly recommend because it's really T-Mobile without all the headaches!,5
Only thing is the charger that came with the phone stopped working to where the only way I could charge my phone is if I turn the phone completely off. The phone itself works perfect I love it.,5
"Received it in time!Brand new!Unlocked works in Venezuela.Just make sure to read the reviews of the seller, I read them and saw that most of them were positive so I purchased and everything worked great!",5
"I brought an iphone 5 from this sellers in June 2015. The phone was not what I expected to receive, and the worst part about it is I can't use the phone. This battery can't hold a charge for nothing, not even a half an hour.I would not recommend it purchasing from this seller.",1
DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. the home button was hard to press. And the phone had a shortage. It would restart out of nowhere and the battery life wasn't accurate. And sometimes it wouldn't charge. When it restarted it sometimes deleted things from my phone do not buy it thank god I got a new phone,1
I bought an iPhone from the seller and the seller is great you can trust him so for anybody that wants an iPhone and my iPhone five is still working it's fantastic he's a great seller I will give him all 10 stars Cindy thank you,5
"I personally do not see any significant difference between this phone and the iPhone 4. The only difference is that it's lighter and slimmer. If I had to do it over again, I would stick with the iPhone 4.",4
"This is my first iPhone so I can't compare it to earlier models, but I love it. So simple, such a smooth performance, so many apps, great camera. With the unlocked version, I can use it in any country as long as I change the nano SIM card. Worth the price.",5
"The merchandise was achieved, this was received by the service lady and had saved, her arrived of travel and said that these packages were saved. I'm sorry for this issue, my more sincerely apologize.EXCELLENT ITEM AND GOOD BUYING",5
It is a good phone.My wife had an android now she sees the difference.She says it is a cool phoneThe touch screen works perfect.And everything works perfect too.,5
"Was happy that I got it unlocked, but after I used it. My smile quickly turned upside down, my battery went from 100 percent to 1 percent... have to alway have it charged is I wanted to use it. So most likely I'm going to have to buy a new battery for it. Never again that I go online for a phone smh...",1
I m sorry to tell you that I bought from YOUNGRAMSEYLORD order prescribed as black iphone 5brand new 32gb unlockedBut i received it used with scratches and wearsAlso locked not worked with my sim card And 16 gb.so its fake,1
"cellphone is real, but earphone and charger inside seems to be fake(compare to three of my friends' earphones and chargers). charger is not working properly!!!Company maybe take the original one out, then sell them. I really regret for not checking the mobile accessories before unlocked this cellphone, I even can not return it right now!! :(",1
"Very nice phone, I recommend buying used because the price is super low with a few minor scratches here and there overall good but be carefull on which used one you get.",4
"battery was no good, plus it would do weird things while using it, would freeze up, and the screen, which must have been replaced was not attached properly, must have got the lemon!!",1
"I love apple, and the new iphone 5 is simply amazing, with a processor that never tires, a battery good durability, multifunctionality and versatility, I love it.",5
"No doubt, it's an excellent device, it's faster, lighter and more elegant that its predecessor. Good option for that person who looking for a vanguard technology.",5
"I am happy with my new phone. Everything is very good, the only problem is battery. I drains too quickly (from 6-8 hours when using internet) It really needs improvement!!!",4
"The phone was Defective not like they said ""used like-new, just open box to check internet"" Dropping calls and the Battery dying really fast.Plus, I also got a defective charger cable that i NEVER GOT BACK the new one from them. I don't recommend this seller AT ALL, they are selling BAD products over the internet.",1
They are just wonderful. I had been wanting one and now I have it....got one for my daughter....these phones are absolutely great. Very happy with it.,5
I have had excellent service from Amazon for this item. It was shipped and I received it in one week from my courier in MiamiI have been using an I phone 4for the last 2 years and I must say that with the upgrade to I5 this works faster with lots more apps,4
"I was a bit scared, to fly back to my country and find out that was not unlocked as ordered, but everything worked perfect, also the delivery time .....This is because in some reviews they said that was not new and was not unlocked .......",5

I love the iPhone 5 it works good the only problem was the case and free screen protecter. But I contacted the seller and they responded fast. I wish I got that screen protecter lol but still love the phone :3,4
"I loved the fact that iphone has developed and covered most of its software-related issues in the iOS 7Also and most importantly, I see that iphone 5 is far better than 5C due to having an Aluminum case, while having same attributes.",5
"EQUIPMENT IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, THE CODE IMEI TEAM NO COINSIDE AL OF THE BOX MAKES DEBLOQUEADO FACTORY BUT IN THE CONFIGURATION OF EQUIPMENT BRAND AT & T, BUT IN VENEZUELA ME WORKED VERY WELL, NOT GOOD TO AMAZON VERIFIED PRODUCTS OFFERED BY SELLERS , THANK GOD IT WORKS LIKE THE CELL PHONE, I MEAN THAT YOU OPERATE AS SOME FRIENDS IPOD.",3
My friend brought this for me. The battery backup is dead poor. If I'm traveling or in a vacation. My worry is that the battery is discharging rapidly and I couldn't be able to be in contact with my friends.,1
"This device cannot use really long time. Because its battle has problem from used problem, I check its IMEI in Apple store, then they told me this device can reship a battle and it is free. It is great. Now, I can use it like a new phone.",3
"I bought a used iPhone 5, 32GB, and am very happy with it. I've had it for a month and haven't run into any issues. Did not come with headphones, but included charger.",4
after a year I do not feel happy for the first product will Replace the battery and now stopped working and lost a lot of money for repacion the phone as I like and I lost everything,1
"I've been happy with this phone - I've had it for about a month now and there hasn't been a single problem. It works great, the battery life is good; no complaints at all.",4
"Its like new! I love it! And i but it at a good price. No scratch in the screen, no damage at all its like new and it come with earphone and charger and the boxTotally worth it.",5
"As soon as I got the phone I switched, but it started dropping contacts. I guess it was defective when sold or something went wrong during the shipment. Not happy with this phone. I ended up going back to my old phone. Given this, I will not buy used phones for a long time.",1
"The phones appearance was fresh and new, but the operating system operated like a phone that was 5 years old. The battery drained quickly and the screen would black out while using voice mail.",2
"the phone is very fast and fancy. feels light in your hands like u arent holding anything. I DONT KNOW IF is my phone alone but sometimes the wifi goes and comes back when i go to put it on but its on. so that's the only problem,",4
I ordered this iphone 5 expecting it to be unlocked little did I know it was locked and un accessible I'm only 16 and spent my own money on this for nothing,1
The phone had scratches as said it would. It worked fine. However the problem I had was the charger cord stopped working after a week or two. I received new ones after contacting them about that.,4
"I bought Iphon5 Unlocked. The seller -Everyday Black Friday- promised that phone will be new, with established iOs6. But to me sold phone which was in the use. In a box there is no paper clip for access to a tray with Sim. Model and Imei number on a box don't correspond to numbers in phone. The seller - the deceiver.",1
"iPhone does not work properly with AT&T as advertised. The strength of signal inside buildings drops to ''No Services"" while AT&T cell phone works in the same place well. I returned this item and bought iPhone at AT&T.",2
"Bought This July 2nd 2015. I've Had To Change The Battery Twice. Now Unfortunately Again The Battery Has Stopped Functioning, There's No Way The Batteries Have Such A Short Lifespan, This Phone Was Obviously Faulty.Also The Screen Has Stopped Working. I DO NOT Recommend Buying From This Seller At All.",1
"I purchased 2 of these, they arrived in 2 days! One is working perfect, one had a bad battery and had to be returned. They had my refund processed the same day! I will be ordering another one soon",4
This was perfectly authentic. My phone does usually die around 5-9% however but that's fine since it is a used phone and little things like that are to be expected. I stuck this baby in an otterbox and stuck a glass screen protector on it. Awesome purchase!,5
This phone was not what I expected at all! My phone at little dents all on the back and sides of ohone was chipped . This phone was s*** . Also it said unlocked iphone which it was not unlock and did not even come with a SIM card ! Very pissed off about this !,1
- The headphones stopped working after a few moths- The touch screen doesn't always respond- The lock button stopped working almost immediately- Had to get SIM card tray replaced- Battery only lasts 10 hours with minimal useWhen I was first getting this p,1
On January 12 2015 I bought this phone and I thought that the phone was new but as the battery start to get hot I went to the iStore and they say the phone was not new and it was open by a no authorized agent.I have to change the battery and the iStore did not change it because the phone was out of guaranty,1
I received the iPhone 5C with plastic on the back instead of regular iPhone 5 . We thought that this product is apple iPhone 5 in silver and white color. But my friend said it's fine and she kept it since the price is considerable low,3
"It worked perfect. It was a gift to my daughter, (I'm team Android) and she loves it although I thought I was ordering the 5S ..It was my mistake. She was hurt at first, but now she loves that thing. 32 gigs is a lot. She wont be complaining about storage",5
The iphone arrived well but with the surprise that I discovered that it was repaired in the past and badly assembled.The seller did not specify that detail. it was not in mint conditions,3
Only thing is the charger that came with the phone stopped working to where the only way I could charge my phone is if I turn the phone completely off. The phone itself works perfect I love it.,5
"I brought an iphone 5 from this sellers in June 2015. The phone was not what I expected to receive, and the worst part about it is I can't use the phone. This battery can't hold a charge for nothing, not even a half an hour.I would not recommend it purchasing from this seller.",1
Negative star if I can give. Horrible! Don't buy it. U will just waste ur money if u buy it. It's an old phone with scratches everywhere! The battery is also horrible! It'll run out after 1 hour. And the seller is suck!!! Can't contact or return!,1
"The phone stop working in a month (Starts fine than when the phone is on it turns white completely, i even let it like that for 2hours before it shut down) and my refund request was denied.",1
Works like new - no problems. A little crack on back cover but hardly noticeable. Works fine with T-mobile - just had to purchase a new sim card for $10.,4
"excellent very happy with the product received, I am satisfied with the purchase !!! really congratulate and excellent office !!! thank you very much ...",5
My iPhone arrived in perfect condition as described. So happy with my purchase. I'm really pleased with this phone and all of it's features. Just insert my SIM card and.....ready to GO !,5
"The iphone was not in the perfect conditions I was expecting. A little dirty and some scratch. Also some troubles to get it charged. Appart from that I am happy with the purchase, for now...",3
"LOVE it! it set up with straight talk with no issues or disruption. has great capacity and more to spare for all my apps. battery runs fast, but that an Apple thing, so I wasn't surprised. Great product, speedy delivery, will recommend!",5
"i bought this iPhone and did not work, then I went to an apple store to replace it and looks like the device is not actually the unit which the IMEI looks up, so the service was denied... Don't buy this item, it is a scam.",1
"Brand new, everything still all boxed up, shiny and works great. Took it to a t-mobile store to set up and had to spend $20 on a new sim card, but it started right up with no problems.",5
"Great phone. I read other reviews stating that they got the international unlocked model, but I got model A1428 and it works all the way up to LTE with no issues.",5
"I love it! I was so glad it wasn't stolen, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get service on it. The only downside is that it dies faster when there are too much changes with turning on the wifi and other stuff. Pretty good price for what was given.",4
"the WORST phone EVER!!! THE BATTERY DID NOT HOLD NOT EVEN FOR 3 HOURS, THE PHONE WOULD TURN OFF WITHOUT NOTICE, A TOTAL DISASTER AND TERRIBLE MISTAKE BUYING THIS PHONE, I AM SO UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED",1
"All I can say about this phone is that I am happy with it, if you take good care of it , not installing hundreds of apps, only the necessary ones this phone works lightning fast, I have a friend that bought a similar phone but he installed so many apps that he rendered his phone unusable, and keeps restoring it almost every week.",5
"Hi, I got the new iPhone before 45 days but certainly i have a problem with display of iPhone . It doesn't display anything, it is like power off. When somebody called me i heard the ringtone but i cannot see who is calling me. What's wrong with my iPhone?",5
"wrecked iPhone, it says very good, and has lots of scratches and hits, battery doesn't work at all, neither at the beginning when connecting to the power. Not trustworthy seller. Be aware of this, I lost money for nothing....",1
"It's pretty good, i can't really complain, maybe they should send a more decent charger next time, at first I thought the battery was corrupted, it was the charger, when I used my own, it was better",5
"The description listed was ""Item model number: A1428"" however, what I received was the model number A1429. The problem with this is that A1429 is not compatible with the 4G network.",1
I bought the phone for my son and soon as we got it he was having trouble charging it when i took it to be looked at. come to find out i bought a phone and the battery was no good the battery was permanently damage.,3
Horrible! Not having this phone for even a month and multiple problems are happening. First the screen glitches a lot. Then screen fades to black and even blacks out for days at a time. I am returning it today.,1
"I purchased four of you and only one cut out the problem ,, problem that the device heats up when charging too much and don't save charging inside the machine ends with the development of dormancy after 4 hours",1
"My only complaint The Battery life isn't good it dies quicker than i believe it should.The phone is great, minor scratches from previously used. Shipping was fast and it arrived safely.",2
"It is ok though linking everything to iTunes is rather limiting -updates, playing games, etc. I think the more liberal android phones are much user friendly. The Bluetooth will not link with other phone type Bluetooth. Maybe I missed something",4
"Shipping was fine, the phone works but I think something maybe wrong with product as a whole. Not an issue with seller but Apple. This phone appears very cheaply made in my opinion, the App are shown in very low quality, my itouch 4th gen has better quality images. Still doing my research though.",3
"This phone is just what I was looking for. Familiar layout, works faster tha the iPhone 4. Good camera. Very light and sleek. I love it! The one negative is that it uses a different power cord so I know have to keep two sets of cords/adapters around to accommodate my phone and my iPad.",5
"Lighter than the previous model (iPhone 4S) apple again innovates with this new model.Faster, better screen touch and with the brand new connector without loosing the original speed.",5
"5 stars is not enough for a phone like this. I have had Samsung changing to Samsung was a huge leap. After some years of using smartphones, I love Android and hate Samsung.",5
I used to have iPhone4 16GB I decided to upgrade to iPhone5 64GB.. So far it's I love it. They say that the battery run out that fast but for me it was ok.. It's always depend how u use ur phone.iLove it so much a perfect gift for my self =),5
Just got it and came sooner than expected which makes me really happy can't wait until my new sims come in and I'll be good to go. Flawless looks brand new and the deal is even amazing. Thank you,5
"I've been using a 3GS with an 8GB hard drive up to now, so this is a major step up. I have room for everything and more, I haven't explored the new functionality but I'm looking forward to it.",5
"Maybe because I has no functional problems now because it's new, I've heard things about the batery and etc, but up to now it works incredible, I love this phone",5
"I wish I had known the phone was originally sold in Japan, which meant I couldn't turn off the camera sounds. It didn't come with any cables, just the phone in its box. It did come on time, and the phone lasted pretty well.",3
"VERY DISAPPOINTED...WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAINWhat I got is not a new genius iphone 5. When I just got the phone, the plastic seal did not look right. It looked like was done very sloppy, even had some big holes. After open the box, the iphone has a after market aluminum body shell. Be aware with this seller.",1
Good look physically. The screen looked great however half of the time it didn't register touch. When finally able to type/get into apps it would freeze and multi click. Very frustrating unfortunately,3
"Know that it doesn't come with a sim card, so either be prepared to go to the closest AT&T or Verizon store to get any apps and have phone turned on. Either than that it alright.",3
It has surpassed my expectations. I love it. The vendor was wonderful to work with and responded quickly when I had a request after placing the order. Thanks very much.,5
"The phone does work properly for the most part. The bluetooth does not function which does not allow me to connect to hands free devices, but all other functions work properly. There were more scratches and dings than I expected, but the previous owner did say there were signs of usage. Thankfully, there were no scratches on the touch screen.",3
"I totally love the phone but was deeply upset when I found that the phone shipped to me came with an AT&T nano SIM and I was unable to use my Ethiopian and Afghan SIM cards. I plan to have an actual ""UNLOCKED"" 64GB IPhone 5 shipped to me since I paid astronomical prices and received a useless locked version.",1
"this ad says in the description ""Item model number: A1429"" .. what i received A1428!!there is difference between the two models! i wouldn't made the purchase if they said it's A1428!",1
"I ordered an iPhone 5 64GB Unlocked, and indeed it was what I ordered. It arrived fast and everything as advertised. Thank you.I would recommend it to anybody.",5
"The phone is exactly what it was advertised to be. I have been using it since August, and it is wonderful! Delivered in excellent condition. I would buy from JP Mobiles again without hesitation.",5
It got supposed be unlocked but one more time what have been offered is not exceeded... Terrible.. Now i had to take this Item to another Store here in Caracas to Lock it Out... Moreover waste of money and time...,2
"the phone is presented many probleas the screen is frozen does nothing and should restart it , the other thing is that when I take a picture leaves a red stain on the image and what I read is a burned pixel , now as I get I recognize the guarantee of the equipment was expensive, I am very disappointed",2
"I must say that its a great phone, in great conditions on the outside. However, after few weeks of using, the image on screen showed some lines until it black out completly, that last only a momment not even an hour but doesnt happen all de time. I wish the seller had been more honest about this",3
"This Iphone is fine, unfortunately, it is rated this way because the charger is defaulted and therefore the phone cannot perform to its best since the accessory is not working. This rating will change with a change made towards another charger.",3
"It meet my exceptions , flawless. . I recommended it to anybody who doesn't have time to go to the apple store . And it is unlocked so it works with any sim",5
"is a great phone, I made the purchase and the phone really is new. the seller is very responsible and careful, because when a problem communicating to introduce myself, did everything possible to help",4
Performance Execellent!You can go to any place therefore the IPHONE you have a system efficient localizer that helps the policy to find you in sequestration case.,5
"This is a great product and with the amount of storage I can save all my music and pics., the phone was as explained by the seller so i highly recommend this seller....",5
"Excellent phone!!! Great screen, great apps, great photos, very multifunctional, awesome....I chose this rating because is one of the best phone I've ever seen.I like it because is smarter, is thinnest, is lightweight and very stylish and also because is made it by Apple.",5
I got this phone as a gift for my wife and she loves it. I asked for next day delivery and it was at my door exactly at 3 pm the next day. Many thanks Amazon,5
"This works great. Bought it from amazon warehouse (open box), and it was a good buy! I use it with a smaller carrier (ptel) and it works just fine. Would highly recommend going this route!",5
This phone was purchased used. Arrived in the condition stated a few scratches on side but the screen was fine. Arrived on time. Phone is worked well.,4
This phone is broken and does not charge with the charger provided or an apple charger. the headphones were also not included. It has completely stopped working 2 days outside of the return policy. DO not BUY from JR World.,1
phone looks exactly like the picture. has small scratches on the back but it came with a case and a screen protector which wasn't bad. y'all should get this phone. PLUS ITS 64GB,5
My order arrived a lot earlier than expected. Everything about the product in the description is correct. Very good and I'm happy about it. I will definitely buy from the seller again. Thank you.,5
phones are brand new factory? buy one a few days ago. I get the phone I do not agree with serial box. explain this. my phone provider said it might have trouble or stolen,1
I was very considered about not being able to use this phone with my Walmart plan. It worked WONDERFULLY and the phone looks Brand NEW!!! …I would buy again and again.I LOVE IT thx!,5
"Arrived fast in A+ protected packaging. It looks and works like brand new! The only issue is the battery doesn't stay charged for very long, but we would by from seller again.",3
"Phone was from Japan - could not use in the states even though the claim was that it was a brand new, unlocked phone and could be used anywhere. It was actually registered to a Japanese phone number and an account that was open. Very disappointed.",1
Phone was delivered early but is being sent back because the phone consistantly showed no service. I checked with the carrier and went through apple support and it was a problem with the the phone. It wasn't worth it to spend $100 plus to get it fixed through Apple.,1
not clean iphone.bacttery problem . i went to apple many time to fix it . they check it and said they phone is not register and it is stolen. it can't fixed .,1
This iPhone 5 has terrible reception!!!! The phone locks up a lot when I try to get into it and it is a huge disappointment! A true waste of my money!!,2
I received my phone with bad batteries that I dies in less than 3 hours. And now the battery is worse than before and the power button isn't working. However the iPhone system is not bad,1
"Affordable 64GB capacity. I use this phone on StraightTalk with AT&T service. I purchased my previous iphone (4) directly through StraightTalk over three years ago which operated on Verizon's network. Virtually no difference in coverage, signal strength or service. Really pleased with the purchase.",5
"It's a good deal.The iPhone 5 is great including phone accessories earphone, charger and transmission cable.they also gave me the screen protection and phone case. They are really thoughtful.",5
Phone works great but was a hassle due to not being factory unlocked as it was stated online. It was still locked with T-Mobile and AT&T charged me 100.00 to unlock it and switch it to at&t network.,3
"I bought this device and works great, 2 weeks after lightning cable was damage and the IPhone battery was complety dead, I bought an original Apple lightning cable and surprise, phone doesn't works anymore.",1
"I change my iphone 4 for this iphone 5. I thought the change was going to be dramatic... but it wasn't, compared to my old Iphone 4g this will be a 20-30% faster, stable, thinner, lighter... great product But don't think it should be twice as expensive as the iphone 4 considering that you are getting 25% better phone.",4
"The transaction was smooth and efficient. The phone is great but ... Apple really missed their aim with the plug. It broke on the third day. I ordered another one which sounded tougher, thicker, stronger... It broke in two weeks.Maybe it's just me but I really liked the old plug better. Now I have to buy an adapter to fit my old tools and addons.",5
"I bought an iphone 5, but never thought that batterie life would be SO short. At 3 pm I have to recharge it. I had to turn off everything, bluethooth, wifi, gps, etc and there is no improvement... I cannot belive I spend $950 for this!!",2
"NO figerprint option, bug when it hot outside so people in Texas ans africa can not use that? crazy phone, if I can get my money back I will ask it right away.",2
"Iphone came locked, when tried to contact seller, there was no response. Now I am going through the headache of filing a claim. Extremely disappointed.",1
this product came so fast but I am very dissapointed. the battery dies so fast. like 2 hours. even if you are not using it.the home button doesn't work. I could return it because I was outside the country and when I came back and start using the phone was too late.dont buy a Japanese phone because the batteries of the iphones are very bad,2
"After 2 months of working just fine, the phone suddenly has crapped out. It will not turn on. I'm extremely disappointed and i will never purchase a refurbished phone from Amazon again.",1
"Brand new, everything still all boxed up, shiny and works great. Took it to a t-mobile store to set up and had to spend $20 on a new sim card, but it started right up with no problems.",5

"Phone was from Japan - could not use in the states even though the claim was that it was a brand new, unlocked phone and could be used anywhere. It was actually registered to a Japanese phone number and an account that was open. Very disappointed.",1
phone looks exactly like the picture. has small scratches on the back but it came with a case and a screen protector which wasn't bad. y'all should get this phone. PLUS ITS 64GB,5
"I totally love the phone but was deeply upset when I found that the phone shipped to me came with an AT&T nano SIM and I was unable to use my Ethiopian and Afghan SIM cards. I plan to have an actual ""UNLOCKED"" 64GB IPhone 5 shipped to me since I paid astronomical prices and received a useless locked version.",1
"this ad says in the description ""Item model number: A1429"" .. what i received A1428!!there is difference between the two models! i wouldn't made the purchase if they said it's A1428!",1
"I ordered an iPhone 5 64GB Unlocked, and indeed it was what I ordered. It arrived fast and everything as advertised. Thank you.I would recommend it to anybody.",5
"Hi, I got the new iPhone before 45 days but certainly i have a problem with display of iPhone . It doesn't display anything, it is like power off. When somebody called me i heard the ringtone but i cannot see who is calling me. What's wrong with my iPhone?",5
"wrecked iPhone, it says very good, and has lots of scratches and hits, battery doesn't work at all, neither at the beginning when connecting to the power. Not trustworthy seller. Be aware of this, I lost money for nothing....",1
I received my phone with bad batteries that I dies in less than 3 hours. And now the battery is worse than before and the power button isn't working. However the iPhone system is not bad,1
"It's pretty good, i can't really complain, maybe they should send a more decent charger next time, at first I thought the battery was corrupted, it was the charger, when I used my own, it was better",5
"The description listed was ""Item model number: A1428"" however, what I received was the model number A1429. The problem with this is that A1429 is not compatible with the 4G network.",1
It got supposed be unlocked but one more time what have been offered is not exceeded... Terrible.. Now i had to take this Item to another Store here in Caracas to Lock it Out... Moreover waste of money and time...,2
"Know that it doesn't come with a sim card, so either be prepared to go to the closest AT&T or Verizon store to get any apps and have phone turned on. Either than that it alright.",3
It has surpassed my expectations. I love it. The vendor was wonderful to work with and responded quickly when I had a request after placing the order. Thanks very much.,5
"The phone does work properly for the most part. The bluetooth does not function which does not allow me to connect to hands free devices, but all other functions work properly. There were more scratches and dings than I expected, but the previous owner did say there were signs of usage. Thankfully, there were no scratches on the touch screen.",3
Phone works great but was a hassle due to not being factory unlocked as it was stated online. It was still locked with T-Mobile and AT&T charged me 100.00 to unlock it and switch it to at&t network.,3
"I bought this device and works great, 2 weeks after lightning cable was damage and the IPhone battery was complety dead, I bought an original Apple lightning cable and surprise, phone doesn't works anymore.",1
I bought the phone for my son and soon as we got it he was having trouble charging it when i took it to be looked at. come to find out i bought a phone and the battery was no good the battery was permanently damage.,3
"All I can say about this phone is that I am happy with it, if you take good care of it , not installing hundreds of apps, only the necessary ones this phone works lightning fast, I have a friend that bought a similar phone but he installed so many apps that he rendered his phone unusable, and keeps restoring it almost every week.",5
"It is ok though linking everything to iTunes is rather limiting -updates, playing games, etc. I think the more liberal android phones are much user friendly. The Bluetooth will not link with other phone type Bluetooth. Maybe I missed something",4
"Shipping was fine, the phone works but I think something maybe wrong with product as a whole. Not an issue with seller but Apple. This phone appears very cheaply made in my opinion, the App are shown in very low quality, my itouch 4th gen has better quality images. Still doing my research though.",3
"This phone is just what I was looking for. Familiar layout, works faster tha the iPhone 4. Good camera. Very light and sleek. I love it! The one negative is that it uses a different power cord so I know have to keep two sets of cords/adapters around to accommodate my phone and my iPad.",5
"Lighter than the previous model (iPhone 4S) apple again innovates with this new model.Faster, better screen touch and with the brand new connector without loosing the original speed.",5
"5 stars is not enough for a phone like this. I have had Samsung changing to Samsung was a huge leap. After some years of using smartphones, I love Android and hate Samsung.",5
I used to have iPhone4 16GB I decided to upgrade to iPhone5 64GB.. So far it's I love it. They say that the battery run out that fast but for me it was ok.. It's always depend how u use ur phone.iLove it so much a perfect gift for my self =),5
"The phone is exactly what it was advertised to be. I have been using it since August, and it is wonderful! Delivered in excellent condition. I would buy from JP Mobiles again without hesitation.",5
Phone was delivered early but is being sent back because the phone consistantly showed no service. I checked with the carrier and went through apple support and it was a problem with the the phone. It wasn't worth it to spend $100 plus to get it fixed through Apple.,1
not clean iphone.bacttery problem . i went to apple many time to fix it . they check it and said they phone is not register and it is stolen. it can't fixed .,1
This iPhone 5 has terrible reception!!!! The phone locks up a lot when I try to get into it and it is a huge disappointment! A true waste of my money!!,2
"Brand new, everything still all boxed up, shiny and works great. Took it to a t-mobile store to set up and had to spend $20 on a new sim card, but it started right up with no problems.",5
"NO figerprint option, bug when it hot outside so people in Texas ans africa can not use that? crazy phone, if I can get my money back I will ask it right away.",2
"Iphone came locked, when tried to contact seller, there was no response. Now I am going through the headache of filing a claim. Extremely disappointed.",1
this product came so fast but I am very dissapointed. the battery dies so fast. like 2 hours. even if you are not using it.the home button doesn't work. I could return it because I was outside the country and when I came back and start using the phone was too late.dont buy a Japanese phone because the batteries of the iphones are very bad,2
"After 2 months of working just fine, the phone suddenly has crapped out. It will not turn on. I'm extremely disappointed and i will never purchase a refurbished phone from Amazon again.",1
"Great phone. I read other reviews stating that they got the international unlocked model, but I got model A1428 and it works all the way up to LTE with no issues.",5
"the WORST phone EVER!!! THE BATTERY DID NOT HOLD NOT EVEN FOR 3 HOURS, THE PHONE WOULD TURN OFF WITHOUT NOTICE, A TOTAL DISASTER AND TERRIBLE MISTAKE BUYING THIS PHONE, I AM SO UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED",1
Horrible! Not having this phone for even a month and multiple problems are happening. First the screen glitches a lot. Then screen fades to black and even blacks out for days at a time. I am returning it today.,1
"I purchased four of you and only one cut out the problem ,, problem that the device heats up when charging too much and don't save charging inside the machine ends with the development of dormancy after 4 hours",1
"My only complaint The Battery life isn't good it dies quicker than i believe it should.The phone is great, minor scratches from previously used. Shipping was fast and it arrived safely.",2
"I love it! I was so glad it wasn't stolen, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to get service on it. The only downside is that it dies faster when there are too much changes with turning on the wifi and other stuff. Pretty good price for what was given.",4
"This works great. Bought it from amazon warehouse (open box), and it was a good buy! I use it with a smaller carrier (ptel) and it works just fine. Would highly recommend going this route!",5
This phone was purchased used. Arrived in the condition stated a few scratches on side but the screen was fine. Arrived on time. Phone is worked well.,4
This phone is broken and does not charge with the charger provided or an apple charger. the headphones were also not included. It has completely stopped working 2 days outside of the return policy. DO not BUY from JR World.,1
My order arrived a lot earlier than expected. Everything about the product in the description is correct. Very good and I'm happy about it. I will definitely buy from the seller again. Thank you.,5
phones are brand new factory? buy one a few days ago. I get the phone I do not agree with serial box. explain this. my phone provider said it might have trouble or stolen,1
"I wish I had known the phone was originally sold in Japan, which meant I couldn't turn off the camera sounds. It didn't come with any cables, just the phone in its box. It did come on time, and the phone lasted pretty well.",3
"VERY DISAPPOINTED...WOULD NEVER BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAINWhat I got is not a new genius iphone 5. When I just got the phone, the plastic seal did not look right. It looked like was done very sloppy, even had some big holes. After open the box, the iphone has a after market aluminum body shell. Be aware with this seller.",1
Good look physically. The screen looked great however half of the time it didn't register touch. When finally able to type/get into apps it would freeze and multi click. Very frustrating unfortunately,3
"I change my iphone 4 for this iphone 5. I thought the change was going to be dramatic... but it wasn't, compared to my old Iphone 4g this will be a 20-30% faster, stable, thinner, lighter... great product But don't think it should be twice as expensive as the iphone 4 considering that you are getting 25% better phone.",4
"The transaction was smooth and efficient. The phone is great but ... Apple really missed their aim with the plug. It broke on the third day. I ordered another one which sounded tougher, thicker, stronger... It broke in two weeks.Maybe it's just me but I really liked the old plug better. Now I have to buy an adapter to fit my old tools and addons.",5
"I bought an iphone 5, but never thought that batterie life would be SO short. At 3 pm I have to recharge it. I had to turn off everything, bluethooth, wifi, gps, etc and there is no improvement... I cannot belive I spend $950 for this!!",2
"It meet my exceptions , flawless. . I recommended it to anybody who doesn't have time to go to the apple store . And it is unlocked so it works with any sim",5
"is a great phone, I made the purchase and the phone really is new. the seller is very responsible and careful, because when a problem communicating to introduce myself, did everything possible to help",4
Performance Execellent!You can go to any place therefore the IPHONE you have a system efficient localizer that helps the policy to find you in sequestration case.,5
"This is a great product and with the amount of storage I can save all my music and pics., the phone was as explained by the seller so i highly recommend this seller....",5
"Excellent phone!!! Great screen, great apps, great photos, very multifunctional, awesome....I chose this rating because is one of the best phone I've ever seen.I like it because is smarter, is thinnest, is lightweight and very stylish and also because is made it by Apple.",5
I got this phone as a gift for my wife and she loves it. I asked for next day delivery and it was at my door exactly at 3 pm the next day. Many thanks Amazon,5
"Affordable 64GB capacity. I use this phone on StraightTalk with AT&T service. I purchased my previous iphone (4) directly through StraightTalk over three years ago which operated on Verizon's network. Virtually no difference in coverage, signal strength or service. Really pleased with the purchase.",5
"It's a good deal.The iPhone 5 is great including phone accessories earphone, charger and transmission cable.they also gave me the screen protection and phone case. They are really thoughtful.",5
"LOVE it! it set up with straight talk with no issues or disruption. has great capacity and more to spare for all my apps. battery runs fast, but that an Apple thing, so I wasn't surprised. Great product, speedy delivery, will recommend!",5
"i bought this iPhone and did not work, then I went to an apple store to replace it and looks like the device is not actually the unit which the IMEI looks up, so the service was denied... Don't buy this item, it is a scam.",1
Just got it and came sooner than expected which makes me really happy can't wait until my new sims come in and I'll be good to go. Flawless looks brand new and the deal is even amazing. Thank you,5
"I've been using a 3GS with an 8GB hard drive up to now, so this is a major step up. I have room for everything and more, I haven't explored the new functionality but I'm looking forward to it.",5
"Maybe because I has no functional problems now because it's new, I've heard things about the batery and etc, but up to now it works incredible, I love this phone",5
"Exactly what I expected, the phone worked great for 5 months. Then the camera stopped working,and a short time later the screen would fade to black. I would have to restart the phone to get the screen back and then for just a short time. It was apparent that it was refurbished very poorly or not at all !! Don't buy from this seller",1
"All I can say about this phone is that I am happy with it, if you take good care of it , not installing hundreds of apps, only the necessary ones this phone works lightning fast, I have a friend that bought a similar phone but he installed so many apps that he rendered his phone unusable, and keeps restoring it almost every week.",5
"First, the battery will not reloaded and had to buy a new charger for the battery could work.Now the iphone does not recognize the chip and gsm is no signal to speak.The antenna of the iphone is not functional.",1
"I love my iPhone 5, I have being using it like crazy ever since it arrived. I have been taking excellent clear crisp photo's and I also use the phone to visit my twitter account. Thank you!",5
"I could not connect the phone in Venezuela (my country) because it was not unlocked and it was suposed to be, what can you do in this case? phone IMEI is 013435003182980",1
"this iphone 64 gb not released you are scammer and this anger biggest causes $ 785 and the phone is A1429 NOT a A1428 is blocked by sprint I need you to rejoin my giftcard to gie you and me cheating!! I WANT MY MONEY BACK THIS NO UNLOCKED IPHONE ,",1
"I had a bad experience with this one , but it was all my fault, my mistake, because i wanted to buy the 5s and ended up buying the 5 so i had to returned back to the seller...but then they gave me my money back so no hassle.",3

"the phone is presented many probleas the screen is frozen does nothing and should restart it , the other thing is that when I take a picture leaves a red stain on the image and what I read is a burned pixel , now as I get I recognize the guarantee of the equipment was expensive, I am very disappointed",2
"I must say that its a great phone, in great conditions on the outside. However, after few weeks of using, the image on screen showed some lines until it black out completly, that last only a momment not even an hour but doesnt happen all de time. I wish the seller had been more honest about this",3
"This Iphone is fine, unfortunately, it is rated this way because the charger is defaulted and therefore the phone cannot perform to its best since the accessory is not working. This rating will change with a change made towards another charger.",3

I was very considered about not being able to use this phone with my Walmart plan. It worked WONDERFULLY and the phone looks Brand NEW!!! …I would buy again and again.I LOVE IT thx!,5
"Arrived fast in A+ protected packaging. It looks and works like brand new! The only issue is the battery doesn't stay charged for very long, but we would by from seller again.",3
It got supposed be unlocked but one more time what have been offered is not exceeded... Terrible.. Now i had to take this Item to another Store here in Caracas to Lock it Out... Moreover waste of money and time...,2
I received my phone with bad batteries that I dies in less than 3 hours. And now the battery is worse than before and the power button isn't working. However the iPhone system is not bad,1

I brought this phone in September and it stopped working in October it was a brand new and all the accessories are non genuine. Please save your money and do not buy this phone. They only haven one month warranty. BIG WASTE OF MY MONEY PLEASE DON'T BUY.,1
"The phone had a passcode. I took it an Apple store near me, only to find that it is not really unlocked. Do yourselves a favor and STAY AWAY from this seller!!!",1
Better than I ever expected! Brand new Sprint iPhone still in the package. I broke my 5c and Sprint wanted to charge me $600 for a new phone. I saved myself a bundle finding this gem. They swapped my SIM card and activated this awesome phone.,5
The phone was like new. Only needed a sims card which I got for free from the Apple store and had it installed at the Sprint store. It's working out great!,5
I received the phone quickly but am disappointed to say that the headphone /auxiliary cord plug in does not work. One reeson for wanting the iPhone was for music. Paid a decent price for a manufacturer refurbished phone and it does not completely work,3
Just as described. I contacted seller for a faster shipping option as I was without a phone and he hooked me up. I received it within days! It also came with the SIM card so all I had to do was contact Sprint to activate and I was in business!This is my first iPhone so I am still learning all of it's functions.,5
well i don't have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star,3
"Do not buy, could not activate iPhone due to it still being linked to another account that was not paid up to date..sending back immediately..waste of time and money",1
I took it to the sprint store to get a sim card. told me it's not on their network. Now im stuck.. I have sprint. You lied to me. They don't even know which network it's apart of so i can't do anything.,1
"ugh I asked for the pink and a green one came, also it came cracked with no charger, no headphones not even a box! im super pissed that I wasted my money on that.",1
Phone works great! Had a few problems with the battery and audio but vendor helped me resolve these issues. Phone was in great conditions like stated. this is a great deal.,5
It was shipped on time and was exactly as advertised. In very good condition with only 1 small scratch on the front. Our daughter was thrilled with her Christmas present.,5
I am not the owner of it but I suspect everything is good. It was a gift for a lost soul.Delivery was as stated and on time as promised.Thank you guys so much and have a blessed 2015.Arnold Collins,5
"Love the phone.The only problem was finding a sprint store for the Sim card, but finally found one.Phone is working very good.No problems so far.Came with head phones and phone charger.The phone was New.",4
"Had a hard time getting activated from Sprint and when activated the ear piece didn't work, had to return to Apple and get a another one and that had the same problem , and back to the Apple store again .",2
"When I bought it the advertisement said... unlocked. Its not true... I tried cancel it, but it was not possible. I need to send back, it's big hard time for me... I lived in Brazil....",1
Great phone! I really thought there would a lot pf scratches on it but there was totally nothing it is like brand new the only complaint i have was that the charger was broken but is ok i bought one and it works perfectly fine thank you for the phone,5
"i absolutely love this product, it was everything the description said. there are a few minor scratches but its barely noticeable, phone works great; it included the charger and headphones. it was sold by the warehouse deals, inc",5
"Phone Came On Time ! i was very excited and it came just How it was described , ( no charger , and unlocked , 16GB , ect ) it does Have very light scratches on the back But a good Ole case Will take care of that !!!!!!!! the screen is perfectly clear , phone works just as new , Thank Youu!",4
The item arrived in a timely manner. It was exactly as advertised and contained all the bells and whistles that I expected.. I could not be more pleased.,5
Incredibly disappointed and angry. Bought phone for son (his first) who was very excited to get. Took to Sprint store to get added to plan only to find out phone is reported as stolen. In process of return which I hope goes better than the purchase itself. Yet to be determined.,1
"Product as described, fast shipping. We struggled to get it working and ended up at the Sprint store. Could have been ""user error"". Other than that, no hiccups or issues. Have had the phone for 2 weeks, so far so good.",5
"Phone came in Like New condition as advertised; this includes the condition of the earbuds and charger as well. No trouble activating the device, just had to get a new SIM card from my carrier.Overall, very satisfied with the condition and performance of this device. Great experience and shipping was extremely fast.",5
Came in. Early but terrible! Would't get it unless you can work it properly. It didn't even come with a charger. When said it would be provided. Also it doesn't read my SIM card and won't let you use it like a regular phone. A SIM card is needed to get pass set up.,1
"very pleased with this purchase. I was skeptical buying a previously owned iphone but just couldnt see paying full price for a brand new one since we werent eligible for an upgrade yet. It was a gift for my daughter for christmas. It was in such good shape with the box and all, she had no idea it was previously owned.",5
The add said very good condition not even close the back has obvious signs it has taken at least 2 drops and the screen looks like someone cleaned it with steel wool,1
Really fast shipping and is great quality and all I had to do was make an appointment with apple and they gave me a free SIM card then the phone was turned on,5
"The phone was labeled on Amazon as ""new"", but when I went to get it set up, they told me this phone has a contract on it with another carrier and can't be set up till the contract is paid off. Not very happy with ""ChubbiesTech"". The phone guy chuckled when I told him we got it from ChubbiesTech because he said it happens a lot with their phones.",1
"I went to sprint service for TWO HOURS so I can activate it and they can't do it because this phone is not for sprint, if I were you I wouldn't buy this phone just save up your money",1
"I'm an Android person, got an I-phone 4 and HATED it, decided I'd be an Android person forever, but then I thought I'd try this and I really like it. With all the changes and updates it does most of the Android stuff, easier to clean up memory, the only thing it's missing is Swype.",5
It is less expensive than the iphone 5s and I bought it with no contract to replace the iphone 4s that she had. She loves it and I think the phone looks nice and sleek.,5
There was an issue with the ESN number of this phone. We were unable to use the phone.The seller was easy to work with to give me a quick refund. We still have no phone unfortunatly.,1
"Exactly what I wanted! Phone is in great condition.. Only problem was the SIM card was reported lost or stolen, so had to go to the sprint store and get a new one..",4
"Product I returned it , it was locked because it was reported stolen. Sprint the informed me the device will not work because it's looked because it's stolen item.",1
I bought this I-Phone for my dtr. but I had to return it because it couldn't be unlocked for any other network. phone is beautiful blue. great phone but we just didn't want to be on phone plan,3
"So far so good..... Ordered it Feb 6, 2015 & rcvd it Feb 10, 2015. No problem getting a sim card & having the phone activated. Really no signs of a used phone that i can see. Great seller!",4
"Perfect phone! Only down fall was that I wasn't aware you had to go to sprint to get a SIM card, so that was awkward Christmas morning! But overall great experience.",4
"Not pleased with it , tried to get it connected with sprint. But sprint came back saying the serial number was bad and that it was clearly not a sprint phone . Like the seller clearly states in the title",1
"Couldn't even activated it when it came in . Had to get sprint to do some extra stuff with it , my service still blinks out sometimes like I don't have a SIM card in it",2
I was unable to get the phone activated because I have a T-Mobile phone!! I couldn't get anyone to unlock the phone so I could get the SIMS card that I had to buy to work. The package it came in was also cracked on the edge...,2
"The flash/light does not work, which could really be useful at some times. Also, when I tried activating the phone it shows up as being BLUE cell instead of GREEN with my cellular service. Everything else works pretty well.",3
"Great phone, great service despite not reading the fine print that it doesn't come with a SIM card. Easy fix from my phone carrier and after a friendly email exchange from the shipping carrier all was taken care of.",5
"The iPhone is great, it's the connection to sprint that is terrible. I can't believe they won't unlock their phones. I would encourage anyone to stay away from a phone connected to sprint.",1
Very upset with this purchase. Phone cane with a simcard already active on another account. Took 3 weeks for my carrier to get me a fresh one. Bad experience,1
"Was not a sprint phone like it claims in the title. The sprint store also claims that its refurbished, which is not indicated anywhere in the discription. Very disappointed.",1
"When I got the phone it was in perfect condition. Then when I went to go activate it, it turned it that it had a previous owner with a outstanding balance with sprint so I could not use it. Very disappointed.",1
"We paid the ""new"" price for this phone, but the one that arrived was used. When we went to activate with Sprint, we were told that the prior owner left a balance owing and that we had to pay that in order to activate the phone. I am trying to return phone now.",1
"For the most part the phone works well. However, it does not work as well as the description says. Phone shuts down and shows low battery icon whenever the camera is opened or flash is used. The power cord that came with the home did not work. Overall, it meets every expectation you think of when you order a cell phone online for $100.",3
"2nd try at buying a phone and having it activated on my sprint account. Don't know if its the phones or sprint just sucks. Probably the latter, but I'm done with the trying to save money by buying a used phone.",1
"I received this phone on 04th of March, now the phone don't work well and the clock doesn't work anymore, in addition at the apple store told me that the phone is not new but born on 2014, the supplier, the supplier don' t help me well.",1
"I switched to Sprint and got an HTC One, It is a good phone but before that I had an iPhone 4s, couldn't live without an iPhone i guess! very happy with my switch back to an iPhone!Shipping was fast!",5
"My son words, I wish it wasn't activated!! so Mom had to return it.. Very good condition and for the price of phone was reasonable He was very Disappointed...",3
Phone is great no problems with that. Sims card is the problem and sprint is the biggest problem on getting one. Not the phone guys problem but sprint is just a pain to deal with period. finally after 2 weeks of fighting with sprint they are sending me a new sims card.,3
I liked the phone but unfortunately I had to ship it back due to me not being able to switch to Sprint service. Everything else about the phone is great including the appearance and performance of the phone.,4
I am having the hardest time getting a SIM card. Apple said they can't give me one. All the sprint stores around me are out but I finally found a sprint store that would give me a free SIM card if I activated my phone there. So I did. And I love my new phone. (:,5
Very disappointed the iphone 5c eye received already been activatied and has an outstanding bill So Not Happy it was 4 my daughters 16th b-day she is so sad,1
Quick and easy! Got it fast and activated it without a problem. I liked it so much I bought another for my wife from this company. I highly recommend them.,5
After the first phone we ordered was unable to activate because the serial number was reported Lost/Stolen. The replacement phone the glass was not even fils with the phone indicating that it was refurbished.,1
When I got to the inside of the memory of the phone found out it was from Mexico... I guess peso for dollar i got the right trade for the phone. It works great no issues been able to converge all the files I desire and the call capability is exactly whAt I needed,4
"I have been using the phone for around three weeks with no complaint so far. Exactly as described, functioned with Sprint as advertised, nothing hidden",5
Phone works perfectly!! Activated with no issues. Description was on point. Screen was fine with minor minor minor scratches. No nicks or chips anywhere. VERY SATISFIED with this purchase. And I got it in a timely fashion without expedited shipping. Definitely would recommend to anyone!!!,5
I received the phone quickly but am disappointed to say that the headphone /auxiliary cord plug in does not work. One reeson for wanting the iPhone was for music. Paid a decent price for a manufacturer refurbished phone and it does not completely work,3
Better than I ever expected! Brand new Sprint iPhone still in the package. I broke my 5c and Sprint wanted to charge me $600 for a new phone. I saved myself a bundle finding this gem. They swapped my SIM card and activated this awesome phone.,5
The phone was like new. Only needed a sims card which I got for free from the Apple store and had it installed at the Sprint store. It's working out great!,5
"Do not buy, could not activate iPhone due to it still being linked to another account that was not paid up to date..sending back immediately..waste of time and money",1
I took it to the sprint store to get a sim card. told me it's not on their network. Now im stuck.. I have sprint. You lied to me. They don't even know which network it's apart of so i can't do anything.,1
Just as described. I contacted seller for a faster shipping option as I was without a phone and he hooked me up. I received it within days! It also came with the SIM card so all I had to do was contact Sprint to activate and I was in business!This is my first iPhone so I am still learning all of it's functions.,5
well i don't have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star,3
"This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!!",5
"Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price.",4
"Great deal for an iPhone! We use it for our tween (and as backup for Waze and other apps) as an AT&T GoPhone. Since the case is less robust than the other iPhones, we got an Otterbox case and so far it's been working great!",5
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new .,2
"I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline.",1
I had the phone for about two months and all of a sudden it starts shutting off on me and won't stay on contacted the seller and got no response. Horrible service and looks like it was put together like crap,1
"Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast.",5
"Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract.",3
Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs.,5
Purchases a used iPhone and that's what it got. Looks used with scratches on screen. I put an Otter box on it for protection but it also works to cover used look. Phone works great. Good phone for kids.,4
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,2
Cell phone works as expected. So far no problems with the cell phone.Had a little trouble with the charger but had no problems at all getting a replacement. Customer service was great. Will differently buy again in the future.,5
I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster.,1
"Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the ""best"" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both.",5
"The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back.",2
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5
Just received my iPhone 5c used but like brand new:) working so far perfectly on WiFi only.. Will hook up with AT&T Monday.. From HandHeld Heroes as promised.. With charger.. Will be doing business with them again.. Can't say enough nice stuff about them!,5
"Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful.",1
"When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone.",1
at this time the phone works fine. The cables were not a Apple approved charging cable and they were disabled by Itunes. Had to spend more money on a cable,3
"I got this few days before Christmas and it came it right in time. The phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. My daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. So far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there's any concern on the phone, hopefully not.",5
"The phone is new. Everything is included in the package. However, the ICCID of the SIM was identified by AT&T as permanently disabled. So instead of being able to activate it online, I'm going to have to the nearest AT&T store an hour away.5 stars for the phone itself. 3 starts for the BS SIM card.",3
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy,1
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new! Also love the case but I do use other ones. In the pics I have a sticker button and a screen protector so I can't show you the screen,5
"Got this from Doc and Roc Overstock through Amazon as a replacement for my wife's phone. Seller was awesome and super fast, device works wonderfully. No complaints, everything working perfectly.",5
The iPhone itself works like a charm! I was very pleased with my purchase. However the charger that came with the iPhone was very short and charged the phone really slow which wasn't too big of a problem being that you can get another charger for a small price. Overall I love the iPhone. Thanks!,5
"Phone was in decent physical shape but the battery sucks. When I went to replace it someone had glued the battery in, some the screws were missing to the circuit boards. Now the phone freezes and restarts very often.",1
I was happy I got a case and a charger that was in the description but I was told the phone works perfectly fine but it doesn't. The phone twitches which is beyond annoying. I don't appreciate that,1
"I was nervous about getting a used phone,but so far I have not had any problems .It works and functions every bit as good as the new iPhone I had before someone stole in hospital lobby as I was charging it!..My contract wasn't up and I couldn't afford the 500~600 for another one!",5
"Great phone for my daughter. She still has it. Was practically new when I received it. Seller was wonderful and very helpful with some of the technical issues we had, not with the phone. Would highly recommend him.",5
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought.,1
"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap.",1
"I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested!",1
The phone was a gift to my grandson to replace his broken phone. It was just as described and was easy to set up. Everything migrated over very easily and completely. Phone was in very good condition,5
"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it,1
"I have had phone for a short time and the top of the screen started to crack without me going anything. I thought I was purchasing a quality product, but I was mistaken. I have been an Amazon prime shopper for a long time and this has been my worst purchase.",1
"Brought for my Grandaughter and she loves it, still working strong.....now she want the one that works underwater, so then this phone will soon be mine....I guess I need to get updated shortly from my good ole Pantech Matrix flip phone with keypad....",5
"I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating.",2
I bought this phone for my husband for his birthday. He was still using his original flip phone from 2006 prior to this. He is so glad that I got this phone. He doesn't know why he didn't change to this sooner. He found it easy to use.,5
"This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no?",4
The 5c is an awesome device. This device doesn't just come in black or white like all of the other iPhones. The plastic build is also good quality and feels durable.,5
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see.,4
"The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too!",4
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage. It's simple but effective. The seller didn't fail to give good service. The iPhone 's legit and I love it!",5
"The delivery was fast, the phone is in good shape for the most part. The earphone port is broken though. My earphones can't go all the way in which is upsetting because I am that person that uses my earphones nonstop!",2
The phone arrived earlier than anticipated and it is absolutely as good as new. I am very pleased and will definitely work with this seller when my husband purchases a new phone in a few months. No complaints at all!,5
I ordered my phone Tuesday night at almost midnight and received it today even though shipping said May 17- June 2. I use AT&T go phone and all I had to do was go into my local store for a sim card and they set it up! So pleased with this purchase,5
"The phone arrived and the touch on the screen is messed up. :( It works okay sometimes but most of the time if I touch something, it reads like I touched another part of the screen and something else opens instead. Very frustrating.",1
"it has a glitch that drops wifi, and you can't simply turn it back on. shut it off, then reboot, and wifi capability returns. otherwise, it's been a good phone. it's used, after all. even a new one can have a glitch, over time.",4
"The phone was on time and no cracks, but minor wear. However, after a week it blanked out and gave me issues, it does this once every few weeks.But other than that, I do enjoy my phone.",4
"Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a ""new"" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work.",1
"The iPhone heats up & battery dies too fast & I only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don't seem like it. From internal conditions. looks great, don't work great:(",2
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
"when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good.",1
"The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it.",2
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"The description said it was in 'very good' condition, but when I actually received the phone it was in perfect condition. No nicks or scratches period. Definitely recommend.",5
Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together!,2
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5

The screen was popped out. It had scratches on the back. Didn't match description. I dropped it on a soft surface and my screen was jacked. I had to pay to get it fixed.,1
Received my phone faster than expected. Just what I wanted. The phone has been working just fine. The price was right and I have enjoyed using the phone.,4
Love the phone got here on time....At first i had read it would have a few scratches but you cant even tell. Thank you love the phone...plus any questions i had they would right away answer them....,5

"The phone was in the condition as advertised which was ""fair"". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen",3
Absolutely Awful This seller sold me a lost or stolen phone that has a block on it. The phone appearance was great however I could not get it activated because there was a system block on the phone.beyond angry! 0stars!!!,1
"I'm not a fan of Apple anymore, I had gotten it to do Face Time with my little cousin but I was under the assumption it was an AT&T Phone I could use on Straight Talk but turned out it was a Sprint phone. If you like iPhones it's nice but I found it too small as well",1
"Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody!",5
"For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it.",5
The phone came within a week. The phone fit the description and it was unlocked for me to use. Phone was in great condition and will definitely order again.,5

I am having the hardest time getting a SIM card. Apple said they can't give me one. All the sprint stores around me are out but I finally found a sprint store that would give me a free SIM card if I activated my phone there. So I did. And I love my new phone. (:,5
Very disappointed the iphone 5c eye received already been activatied and has an outstanding bill So Not Happy it was 4 my daughters 16th b-day she is so sad,1
Quick and easy! Got it fast and activated it without a problem. I liked it so much I bought another for my wife from this company. I highly recommend them.,5
The add said very good condition not even close the back has obvious signs it has taken at least 2 drops and the screen looks like someone cleaned it with steel wool,1
Really fast shipping and is great quality and all I had to do was make an appointment with apple and they gave me a free SIM card then the phone was turned on,5
"The phone was labeled on Amazon as ""new"", but when I went to get it set up, they told me this phone has a contract on it with another carrier and can't be set up till the contract is paid off. Not very happy with ""ChubbiesTech"". The phone guy chuckled when I told him we got it from ChubbiesTech because he said it happens a lot with their phones.",1
"I went to sprint service for TWO HOURS so I can activate it and they can't do it because this phone is not for sprint, if I were you I wouldn't buy this phone just save up your money",1
"For the most part the phone works well. However, it does not work as well as the description says. Phone shuts down and shows low battery icon whenever the camera is opened or flash is used. The power cord that came with the home did not work. Overall, it meets every expectation you think of when you order a cell phone online for $100.",3
"2nd try at buying a phone and having it activated on my sprint account. Don't know if its the phones or sprint just sucks. Probably the latter, but I'm done with the trying to save money by buying a used phone.",1
"I received this phone on 04th of March, now the phone don't work well and the clock doesn't work anymore, in addition at the apple store told me that the phone is not new but born on 2014, the supplier, the supplier don' t help me well.",1
"Love the phone.The only problem was finding a sprint store for the Sim card, but finally found one.Phone is working very good.No problems so far.Came with head phones and phone charger.The phone was New.",4
I received the phone quickly but am disappointed to say that the headphone /auxiliary cord plug in does not work. One reeson for wanting the iPhone was for music. Paid a decent price for a manufacturer refurbished phone and it does not completely work,3
I bought this I-Phone for my dtr. but I had to return it because it couldn't be unlocked for any other network. phone is beautiful blue. great phone but we just didn't want to be on phone plan,3
"So far so good..... Ordered it Feb 6, 2015 & rcvd it Feb 10, 2015. No problem getting a sim card & having the phone activated. Really no signs of a used phone that i can see. Great seller!",4
"very pleased with this purchase. I was skeptical buying a previously owned iphone but just couldnt see paying full price for a brand new one since we werent eligible for an upgrade yet. It was a gift for my daughter for christmas. It was in such good shape with the box and all, she had no idea it was previously owned.",5
"Great phone, great service despite not reading the fine print that it doesn't come with a SIM card. Easy fix from my phone carrier and after a friendly email exchange from the shipping carrier all was taken care of.",5
Just as described. I contacted seller for a faster shipping option as I was without a phone and he hooked me up. I received it within days! It also came with the SIM card so all I had to do was contact Sprint to activate and I was in business!This is my first iPhone so I am still learning all of it's functions.,5
well i don't have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star,3
"Had a hard time getting activated from Sprint and when activated the ear piece didn't work, had to return to Apple and get a another one and that had the same problem , and back to the Apple store again .",2
"When I bought it the advertisement said... unlocked. Its not true... I tried cancel it, but it was not possible. I need to send back, it's big hard time for me... I lived in Brazil....",1
Great phone! I really thought there would a lot pf scratches on it but there was totally nothing it is like brand new the only complaint i have was that the charger was broken but is ok i bought one and it works perfectly fine thank you for the phone,5
"i absolutely love this product, it was everything the description said. there are a few minor scratches but its barely noticeable, phone works great; it included the charger and headphones. it was sold by the warehouse deals, inc",5
"The iPhone is great, it's the connection to sprint that is terrible. I can't believe they won't unlock their phones. I would encourage anyone to stay away from a phone connected to sprint.",1
Very upset with this purchase. Phone cane with a simcard already active on another account. Took 3 weeks for my carrier to get me a fresh one. Bad experience,1
"Was not a sprint phone like it claims in the title. The sprint store also claims that its refurbished, which is not indicated anywhere in the discription. Very disappointed.",1
"When I got the phone it was in perfect condition. Then when I went to go activate it, it turned it that it had a previous owner with a outstanding balance with sprint so I could not use it. Very disappointed.",1
"We paid the ""new"" price for this phone, but the one that arrived was used. When we went to activate with Sprint, we were told that the prior owner left a balance owing and that we had to pay that in order to activate the phone. I am trying to return phone now.",1
Came in. Early but terrible! Would't get it unless you can work it properly. It didn't even come with a charger. When said it would be provided. Also it doesn't read my SIM card and won't let you use it like a regular phone. A SIM card is needed to get pass set up.,1
It was shipped on time and was exactly as advertised. In very good condition with only 1 small scratch on the front. Our daughter was thrilled with her Christmas present.,5
I am not the owner of it but I suspect everything is good. It was a gift for a lost soul.Delivery was as stated and on time as promised.Thank you guys so much and have a blessed 2015.Arnold Collins,5
When I got to the inside of the memory of the phone found out it was from Mexico... I guess peso for dollar i got the right trade for the phone. It works great no issues been able to converge all the files I desire and the call capability is exactly whAt I needed,4
"I have been using the phone for around three weeks with no complaint so far. Exactly as described, functioned with Sprint as advertised, nothing hidden",5
Phone works perfectly!! Activated with no issues. Description was on point. Screen was fine with minor minor minor scratches. No nicks or chips anywhere. VERY SATISFIED with this purchase. And I got it in a timely fashion without expedited shipping. Definitely would recommend to anyone!!!,5
"I switched to Sprint and got an HTC One, It is a good phone but before that I had an iPhone 4s, couldn't live without an iPhone i guess! very happy with my switch back to an iPhone!Shipping was fast!",5
"My son words, I wish it wasn't activated!! so Mom had to return it.. Very good condition and for the price of phone was reasonable He was very Disappointed...",3
Phone is great no problems with that. Sims card is the problem and sprint is the biggest problem on getting one. Not the phone guys problem but sprint is just a pain to deal with period. finally after 2 weeks of fighting with sprint they are sending me a new sims card.,3
"ugh I asked for the pink and a green one came, also it came cracked with no charger, no headphones not even a box! im super pissed that I wasted my money on that.",1
Phone works great! Had a few problems with the battery and audio but vendor helped me resolve these issues. Phone was in great conditions like stated. this is a great deal.,5
After the first phone we ordered was unable to activate because the serial number was reported Lost/Stolen. The replacement phone the glass was not even fils with the phone indicating that it was refurbished.,1
Better than I ever expected! Brand new Sprint iPhone still in the package. I broke my 5c and Sprint wanted to charge me $600 for a new phone. I saved myself a bundle finding this gem. They swapped my SIM card and activated this awesome phone.,5
The phone was like new. Only needed a sims card which I got for free from the Apple store and had it installed at the Sprint store. It's working out great!,5
"Phone Came On Time ! i was very excited and it came just How it was described , ( no charger , and unlocked , 16GB , ect ) it does Have very light scratches on the back But a good Ole case Will take care of that !!!!!!!! the screen is perfectly clear , phone works just as new , Thank Youu!",4
The item arrived in a timely manner. It was exactly as advertised and contained all the bells and whistles that I expected.. I could not be more pleased.,5
I received the phone quickly but am disappointed to say that the headphone /auxiliary cord plug in does not work. One reeson for wanting the iPhone was for music. Paid a decent price for a manufacturer refurbished phone and it does not completely work,3
"Do not buy, could not activate iPhone due to it still being linked to another account that was not paid up to date..sending back immediately..waste of time and money",1
I took it to the sprint store to get a sim card. told me it's not on their network. Now im stuck.. I have sprint. You lied to me. They don't even know which network it's apart of so i can't do anything.,1
"very pleased with this purchase. I was skeptical buying a previously owned iphone but just couldnt see paying full price for a brand new one since we werent eligible for an upgrade yet. It was a gift for my daughter for christmas. It was in such good shape with the box and all, she had no idea it was previously owned.",5
"Perfect phone! Only down fall was that I wasn't aware you had to go to sprint to get a SIM card, so that was awkward Christmas morning! But overall great experience.",4
"Not pleased with it , tried to get it connected with sprint. But sprint came back saying the serial number was bad and that it was clearly not a sprint phone . Like the seller clearly states in the title",1
"Couldn't even activated it when it came in . Had to get sprint to do some extra stuff with it , my service still blinks out sometimes like I don't have a SIM card in it",2
I was unable to get the phone activated because I have a T-Mobile phone!! I couldn't get anyone to unlock the phone so I could get the SIMS card that I had to buy to work. The package it came in was also cracked on the edge...,2
"Love the phone.The only problem was finding a sprint store for the Sim card, but finally found one.Phone is working very good.No problems so far.Came with head phones and phone charger.The phone was New.",4
"The flash/light does not work, which could really be useful at some times. Also, when I tried activating the phone it shows up as being BLUE cell instead of GREEN with my cellular service. Everything else works pretty well.",3
"Great phone, great service despite not reading the fine print that it doesn't come with a SIM card. Easy fix from my phone carrier and after a friendly email exchange from the shipping carrier all was taken care of.",5
"For the most part the phone works well. However, it does not work as well as the description says. Phone shuts down and shows low battery icon whenever the camera is opened or flash is used. The power cord that came with the home did not work. Overall, it meets every expectation you think of when you order a cell phone online for $100.",3
"2nd try at buying a phone and having it activated on my sprint account. Don't know if its the phones or sprint just sucks. Probably the latter, but I'm done with the trying to save money by buying a used phone.",1
"I received this phone on 04th of March, now the phone don't work well and the clock doesn't work anymore, in addition at the apple store told me that the phone is not new but born on 2014, the supplier, the supplier don' t help me well.",1
"The phone was labeled on Amazon as ""new"", but when I went to get it set up, they told me this phone has a contract on it with another carrier and can't be set up till the contract is paid off. Not very happy with ""ChubbiesTech"". The phone guy chuckled when I told him we got it from ChubbiesTech because he said it happens a lot with their phones.",1
"I went to sprint service for TWO HOURS so I can activate it and they can't do it because this phone is not for sprint, if I were you I wouldn't buy this phone just save up your money",1
Just as described. I contacted seller for a faster shipping option as I was without a phone and he hooked me up. I received it within days! It also came with the SIM card so all I had to do was contact Sprint to activate and I was in business!This is my first iPhone so I am still learning all of it's functions.,5
well i don't have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star,3
"I'm an Android person, got an I-phone 4 and HATED it, decided I'd be an Android person forever, but then I thought I'd try this and I really like it. With all the changes and updates it does most of the Android stuff, easier to clean up memory, the only thing it's missing is Swype.",5
It is less expensive than the iphone 5s and I bought it with no contract to replace the iphone 4s that she had. She loves it and I think the phone looks nice and sleek.,5
There was an issue with the ESN number of this phone. We were unable to use the phone.The seller was easy to work with to give me a quick refund. We still have no phone unfortunatly.,1
"Exactly what I wanted! Phone is in great condition.. Only problem was the SIM card was reported lost or stolen, so had to go to the sprint store and get a new one..",4
"Product I returned it , it was locked because it was reported stolen. Sprint the informed me the device will not work because it's looked because it's stolen item.",1
The add said very good condition not even close the back has obvious signs it has taken at least 2 drops and the screen looks like someone cleaned it with steel wool,1
Really fast shipping and is great quality and all I had to do was make an appointment with apple and they gave me a free SIM card then the phone was turned on,5
I liked the phone but unfortunately I had to ship it back due to me not being able to switch to Sprint service. Everything else about the phone is great including the appearance and performance of the phone.,4
I am having the hardest time getting a SIM card. Apple said they can't give me one. All the sprint stores around me are out but I finally found a sprint store that would give me a free SIM card if I activated my phone there. So I did. And I love my new phone. (:,5
Very disappointed the iphone 5c eye received already been activatied and has an outstanding bill So Not Happy it was 4 my daughters 16th b-day she is so sad,1
Quick and easy! Got it fast and activated it without a problem. I liked it so much I bought another for my wife from this company. I highly recommend them.,5
Incredibly disappointed and angry. Bought phone for son (his first) who was very excited to get. Took to Sprint store to get added to plan only to find out phone is reported as stolen. In process of return which I hope goes better than the purchase itself. Yet to be determined.,1
"Product as described, fast shipping. We struggled to get it working and ended up at the Sprint store. Could have been ""user error"". Other than that, no hiccups or issues. Have had the phone for 2 weeks, so far so good.",5
"Phone came in Like New condition as advertised; this includes the condition of the earbuds and charger as well. No trouble activating the device, just had to get a new SIM card from my carrier.Overall, very satisfied with the condition and performance of this device. Great experience and shipping was extremely fast.",5
I bought this I-Phone for my dtr. but I had to return it because it couldn't be unlocked for any other network. phone is beautiful blue. great phone but we just didn't want to be on phone plan,3
"So far so good..... Ordered it Feb 6, 2015 & rcvd it Feb 10, 2015. No problem getting a sim card & having the phone activated. Really no signs of a used phone that i can see. Great seller!",4
I was happy I got a case and a charger that was in the description but I was told the phone works perfectly fine but it doesn't. The phone twitches which is beyond annoying. I don't appreciate that,1
"I was nervous about getting a used phone,but so far I have not had any problems .It works and functions every bit as good as the new iPhone I had before someone stole in hospital lobby as I was charging it!..My contract wasn't up and I couldn't afford the 500~600 for another one!",5
at this time the phone works fine. The cables were not a Apple approved charging cable and they were disabled by Itunes. Had to spend more money on a cable,3
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage. It's simple but effective. The seller didn't fail to give good service. The iPhone 's legit and I love it!",5
"The description said it was in 'very good' condition, but when I actually received the phone it was in perfect condition. No nicks or scratches period. Definitely recommend.",5
Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together!,2
I had the phone for about two months and all of a sudden it starts shutting off on me and won't stay on contacted the seller and got no response. Horrible service and looks like it was put together like crap,1
"when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good.",1
"The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it.",2
"When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone.",1
"Great phone for my daughter. She still has it. Was practically new when I received it. Seller was wonderful and very helpful with some of the technical issues we had, not with the phone. Would highly recommend him.",5
"Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody!",5
"For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it.",5
The phone came within a week. The phone fit the description and it was unlocked for me to use. Phone was in great condition and will definitely order again.,5
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!!",5
"Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price.",4
"Great deal for an iPhone! We use it for our tween (and as backup for Waze and other apps) as an AT&T GoPhone. Since the case is less robust than the other iPhones, we got an Otterbox case and so far it's been working great!",5
"Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast.",5
"Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract.",3
Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs.,5
"The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back.",2
The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it,1
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought.,1
"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap.",1
"I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested!",1
The phone was a gift to my grandson to replace his broken phone. It was just as described and was easy to set up. Everything migrated over very easily and completely. Phone was in very good condition,5
I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new! Also love the case but I do use other ones. In the pics I have a sticker button and a screen protector so I can't show you the screen,5
"Got this from Doc and Roc Overstock through Amazon as a replacement for my wife's phone. Seller was awesome and super fast, device works wonderfully. No complaints, everything working perfectly.",5
The iPhone itself works like a charm! I was very pleased with my purchase. However the charger that came with the iPhone was very short and charged the phone really slow which wasn't too big of a problem being that you can get another charger for a small price. Overall I love the iPhone. Thanks!,5
"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
"Phone was in decent physical shape but the battery sucks. When I went to replace it someone had glued the battery in, some the screws were missing to the circuit boards. Now the phone freezes and restarts very often.",1
"The phone arrived and the touch on the screen is messed up. :( It works okay sometimes but most of the time if I touch something, it reads like I touched another part of the screen and something else opens instead. Very frustrating.",1
"it has a glitch that drops wifi, and you can't simply turn it back on. shut it off, then reboot, and wifi capability returns. otherwise, it's been a good phone. it's used, after all. even a new one can have a glitch, over time.",4
"The phone was on time and no cracks, but minor wear. However, after a week it blanked out and gave me issues, it does this once every few weeks.But other than that, I do enjoy my phone.",4
"Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a ""new"" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work.",1
"The iPhone heats up & battery dies too fast & I only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don't seem like it. From internal conditions. looks great, don't work great:(",2
"It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again",5
"The phone was in the condition as advertised which was ""fair"". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen",3
Absolutely Awful This seller sold me a lost or stolen phone that has a block on it. The phone appearance was great however I could not get it activated because there was a system block on the phone.beyond angry! 0stars!!!,1
"I'm not a fan of Apple anymore, I had gotten it to do Face Time with my little cousin but I was under the assumption it was an AT&T Phone I could use on Straight Talk but turned out it was a Sprint phone. If you like iPhones it's nice but I found it too small as well",1
"I got this few days before Christmas and it came it right in time. The phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. My daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. So far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there's any concern on the phone, hopefully not.",5
"The phone is new. Everything is included in the package. However, the ICCID of the SIM was identified by AT&T as permanently disabled. So instead of being able to activate it online, I'm going to have to the nearest AT&T store an hour away.5 stars for the phone itself. 3 starts for the BS SIM card.",3
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy,1
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol.,1
"This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no?",4
The 5c is an awesome device. This device doesn't just come in black or white like all of the other iPhones. The plastic build is also good quality and feels durable.,5
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see.,4
"The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too!",4
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,2
Cell phone works as expected. So far no problems with the cell phone.Had a little trouble with the charger but had no problems at all getting a replacement. Customer service was great. Will differently buy again in the future.,5
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster.,1
"Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the ""best"" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both.",5
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new .,2
"I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline.",1
The screen was popped out. It had scratches on the back. Didn't match description. I dropped it on a soft surface and my screen was jacked. I had to pay to get it fixed.,1
Received my phone faster than expected. Just what I wanted. The phone has been working just fine. The price was right and I have enjoyed using the phone.,4
Love the phone got here on time....At first i had read it would have a few scratches but you cant even tell. Thank you love the phone...plus any questions i had they would right away answer them....,5
"I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating.",2
I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new!

Better than I ever expected! Brand new Sprint iPhone still in the package. I broke my 5c and Sprint wanted to charge me $600 for a new phone. I saved myself a bundle finding this gem. They swapped my SIM card and activated this awesome phone.,5
The phone was like new. Only needed a sims card which I got for free from the Apple store and had it installed at the Sprint store. It's working out great!,5

There was an issue with the ESN number of this phone. We were unable to use the phone.The seller was easy to work with to give me a quick refund. We still have no phone unfortunatly.,1
"Exactly what I wanted! Phone is in great condition.. Only problem was the SIM card was reported lost or stolen, so had to go to the sprint store and get a new one..",4
"Product I returned it , it was locked because it was reported stolen. Sprint the informed me the device will not work because it's looked because it's stolen item.",1
Just as described. I contacted seller for a faster shipping option as I was without a phone and he hooked me up. I received it within days! It also came with the SIM card so all I had to do was contact Sprint to activate and I was in business!This is my first iPhone so I am still learning all of it's functions.,5
well i don't have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star,3
After the first phone we ordered was unable to activate because the serial number was reported Lost/Stolen. The replacement phone the glass was not even fils with the phone indicating that it was refurbished.,1
"The phone was labeled on Amazon as ""new"", but when I went to get it set up, they told me this phone has a contract on it with another carrier and can't be set up till the contract is paid off. Not very happy with ""ChubbiesTech"". The phone guy chuckled when I told him we got it from ChubbiesTech because he said it happens a lot with their phones.",1
"I went to sprint service for TWO HOURS so I can activate it and they can't do it because this phone is not for sprint, if I were you I wouldn't buy this phone just save up your money",1
"very pleased with this purchase. I was skeptical buying a previously owned iphone but just couldnt see paying full price for a brand new one since we werent eligible for an upgrade yet. It was a gift for my daughter for christmas. It was in such good shape with the box and all, she had no idea it was previously owned.",5
Came in. Early but terrible! Would't get it unless you can work it properly. It didn't even come with a charger. When said it would be provided. Also it doesn't read my SIM card and won't let you use it like a regular phone. A SIM card is needed to get pass set up.,1
The add said very good condition not even close the back has obvious signs it has taken at least 2 drops and the screen looks like someone cleaned it with steel wool,1
Really fast shipping and is great quality and all I had to do was make an appointment with apple and they gave me a free SIM card then the phone was turned on,5
I liked the phone but unfortunately I had to ship it back due to me not being able to switch to Sprint service. Everything else about the phone is great including the appearance and performance of the phone.,4
I am having the hardest time getting a SIM card. Apple said they can't give me one. All the sprint stores around me are out but I finally found a sprint store that would give me a free SIM card if I activated my phone there. So I did. And I love my new phone. (:,5
Very disappointed the iphone 5c eye received already been activatied and has an outstanding bill So Not Happy it was 4 my daughters 16th b-day she is so sad,1
Quick and easy! Got it fast and activated it without a problem. I liked it so much I bought another for my wife from this company. I highly recommend them.,5
"The iPhone is great, it's the connection to sprint that is terrible. I can't believe they won't unlock their phones. I would encourage anyone to stay away from a phone connected to sprint.",1
Very upset with this purchase. Phone cane with a simcard already active on another account. Took 3 weeks for my carrier to get me a fresh one. Bad experience,1
"Was not a sprint phone like it claims in the title. The sprint store also claims that its refurbished, which is not indicated anywhere in the discription. Very disappointed.",1
"When I got the phone it was in perfect condition. Then when I went to go activate it, it turned it that it had a previous owner with a outstanding balance with sprint so I could not use it. Very disappointed.",1
"We paid the ""new"" price for this phone, but the one that arrived was used. When we went to activate with Sprint, we were told that the prior owner left a balance owing and that we had to pay that in order to activate the phone. I am trying to return phone now.",1
I bought this I-Phone for my dtr. but I had to return it because it couldn't be unlocked for any other network. phone is beautiful blue. great phone but we just didn't want to be on phone plan,3
"So far so good..... Ordered it Feb 6, 2015 & rcvd it Feb 10, 2015. No problem getting a sim card & having the phone activated. Really no signs of a used phone that i can see. Great seller!",4
"Phone Came On Time ! i was very excited and it came just How it was described , ( no charger , and unlocked , 16GB , ect ) it does Have very light scratches on the back But a good Ole case Will take care of that !!!!!!!! the screen is perfectly clear , phone works just as new , Thank Youu!",4
"The flash/light does not work, which could really be useful at some times. Also, when I tried activating the phone it shows up as being BLUE cell instead of GREEN with my cellular service. Everything else works pretty well.",3
"ugh I asked for the pink and a green one came, also it came cracked with no charger, no headphones not even a box! im super pissed that I wasted my money on that.",1
Phone works great! Had a few problems with the battery and audio but vendor helped me resolve these issues. Phone was in great conditions like stated. this is a great deal.,5
"Love the phone.The only problem was finding a sprint store for the Sim card, but finally found one.Phone is working very good.No problems so far.Came with head phones and phone charger.The phone was New.",4
Incredibly disappointed and angry. Bought phone for son (his first) who was very excited to get. Took to Sprint store to get added to plan only to find out phone is reported as stolen. In process of return which I hope goes better than the purchase itself. Yet to be determined.,1
"Product as described, fast shipping. We struggled to get it working and ended up at the Sprint store. Could have been ""user error"". Other than that, no hiccups or issues. Have had the phone for 2 weeks, so far so good.",5
"Phone came in Like New condition as advertised; this includes the condition of the earbuds and charger as well. No trouble activating the device, just had to get a new SIM card from my carrier.Overall, very satisfied with the condition and performance of this device. Great experience and shipping was extremely fast.",5
It was shipped on time and was exactly as advertised. In very good condition with only 1 small scratch on the front. Our daughter was thrilled with her Christmas present.,5
I am not the owner of it but I suspect everything is good. It was a gift for a lost soul.Delivery was as stated and on time as promised.Thank you guys so much and have a blessed 2015.Arnold Collins,5

I received the phone quickly but am disappointed to say that the headphone /auxiliary cord plug in does not work. One reeson for wanting the iPhone was for music. Paid a decent price for a manufacturer refurbished phone and it does not completely work,3
I liked the phone but unfortunately I had to ship it back due to me not being able to switch to Sprint service. Everything else about the phone is great including the appearance and performance of the phone.,4

The item arrived in a timely manner. It was exactly as advertised and contained all the bells and whistles that I expected.. I could not be more pleased.,5
"Great phone, great service despite not reading the fine print that it doesn't come with a SIM card. Easy fix from my phone carrier and after a friendly email exchange from the shipping carrier all was taken care of.",5
"I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating.",2
"When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone.",1
"The description said it was in 'very good' condition, but when I actually received the phone it was in perfect condition. No nicks or scratches period. Definitely recommend.",5
Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together!,2
"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
at this time the phone works fine. The cables were not a Apple approved charging cable and they were disabled by Itunes. Had to spend more money on a cable,3
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good.",1
"The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it.",2
I had the phone for about two months and all of a sudden it starts shutting off on me and won't stay on contacted the seller and got no response. Horrible service and looks like it was put together like crap,1
"Phone was in decent physical shape but the battery sucks. When I went to replace it someone had glued the battery in, some the screws were missing to the circuit boards. Now the phone freezes and restarts very often.",1
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
"Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast.",5
"Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract.",3
Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs.,5
I was happy I got a case and a charger that was in the description but I was told the phone works perfectly fine but it doesn't. The phone twitches which is beyond annoying. I don't appreciate that,1
"I was nervous about getting a used phone,but so far I have not had any problems .It works and functions every bit as good as the new iPhone I had before someone stole in hospital lobby as I was charging it!..My contract wasn't up and I couldn't afford the 500~600 for another one!",5
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage. It's simple but effective. The seller didn't fail to give good service. The iPhone 's legit and I love it!",5
I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster.,1
"Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the ""best"" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both.",5
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5
Just received my iPhone 5c used but like brand new:) working so far perfectly on WiFi only.. Will hook up with AT&T Monday.. From HandHeld Heroes as promised.. With charger.. Will be doing business with them again.. Can't say enough nice stuff about them!,5
"Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful.",1
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new .,2
"I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline.",1
The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it,1
"I have had phone for a short time and the top of the screen started to crack without me going anything. I thought I was purchasing a quality product, but I was mistaken. I have been an Amazon prime shopper for a long time and this has been my worst purchase.",1
"Brought for my Grandaughter and she loves it, still working strong.....now she want the one that works underwater, so then this phone will soon be mine....I guess I need to get updated shortly from my good ole Pantech Matrix flip phone with keypad....",5
I ordered my phone Tuesday night at almost midnight and received it today even though shipping said May 17- June 2. I use AT&T go phone and all I had to do was go into my local store for a sim card and they set it up! So pleased with this purchase,5
"Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody!",5
"For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it.",5
The phone came within a week. The phone fit the description and it was unlocked for me to use. Phone was in great condition and will definitely order again.,5
"The phone arrived and the touch on the screen is messed up. :( It works okay sometimes but most of the time if I touch something, it reads like I touched another part of the screen and something else opens instead. Very frustrating.",1
"it has a glitch that drops wifi, and you can't simply turn it back on. shut it off, then reboot, and wifi capability returns. otherwise, it's been a good phone. it's used, after all. even a new one can have a glitch, over time.",4
"The phone was on time and no cracks, but minor wear. However, after a week it blanked out and gave me issues, it does this once every few weeks.But other than that, I do enjoy my phone.",4
"Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a ""new"" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work.",1
"The iPhone heats up & battery dies too fast & I only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don't seem like it. From internal conditions. looks great, don't work great:(",2
"The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back.",2
The screen was popped out. It had scratches on the back. Didn't match description. I dropped it on a soft surface and my screen was jacked. I had to pay to get it fixed.,1
Received my phone faster than expected. Just what I wanted. The phone has been working just fine. The price was right and I have enjoyed using the phone.,4
Love the phone got here on time....At first i had read it would have a few scratches but you cant even tell. Thank you love the phone...plus any questions i had they would right away answer them....,5
"This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!!",5
"Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price.",4
"Great deal for an iPhone! We use it for our tween (and as backup for Waze and other apps) as an AT&T GoPhone. Since the case is less robust than the other iPhones, we got an Otterbox case and so far it's been working great!",5
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"I got this few days before Christmas and it came it right in time. The phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. My daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. So far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there's any concern on the phone, hopefully not.",5
"The phone is new. Everything is included in the package. However, the ICCID of the SIM was identified by AT&T as permanently disabled. So instead of being able to activate it online, I'm going to have to the nearest AT&T store an hour away.5 stars for the phone itself. 3 starts for the BS SIM card.",3
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy,1
I bought this phone for my husband for his birthday. He was still using his original flip phone from 2006 prior to this. He is so glad that I got this phone. He doesn't know why he didn't change to this sooner. He found it easy to use.,5
"It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again",5
"The phone was in the condition as advertised which was ""fair"". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen",3
Absolutely Awful This seller sold me a lost or stolen phone that has a block on it. The phone appearance was great however I could not get it activated because there was a system block on the phone.beyond angry! 0stars!!!,1
"I'm not a fan of Apple anymore, I had gotten it to do Face Time with my little cousin but I was under the assumption it was an AT&T Phone I could use on Straight Talk but turned out it was a Sprint phone. If you like iPhones it's nice but I found it too small as well",1
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol.,1
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought.,1
"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap.",1
"I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested!",1
The phone was a gift to my grandson to replace his broken phone. It was just as described and was easy to set up. Everything migrated over very easily and completely. Phone was in very good condition,5
"When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone.",1
"The delivery was fast, the phone is in good shape for the most part. The earphone port is broken though. My earphones can't go all the way in which is upsetting because I am that person that uses my earphones nonstop!",2
The phone arrived earlier than anticipated and it is absolutely as good as new. I am very pleased and will definitely work with this seller when my husband purchases a new phone in a few months. No complaints at all!,5
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,2
Cell phone works as expected. So far no problems with the cell phone.Had a little trouble with the charger but had no problems at all getting a replacement. Customer service was great. Will differently buy again in the future.,5
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
"The phone seems to be decent, but I can't be sure. The listing says it is unlocked, and can be used on Verizon Wireless 4G LTE plans, but when I tried to activate it with the carrier, I was told it cannot be used with them. This was supposed to be my son's 13th birthday gift, now I have to make other plans.",2
I ordered this to replace a previous phone I bought on Amazon that simply stopped working after 1 week. So far this iPhone seems to be working well and I have had no problems. The battery isn't that great but thats to be expected with an older phone.,4
"This phone lasted me 4 good years. Worked very well. I upgraded to a 7 last week & honestly its just like it. Only difference is that the screen on the 7 is bigger. Didn't see much difference in camera. If you like small phones or are scared about dropping a big phone then this phone is just for you. Gets the job of being a phone, done.",5
Got this phone a few days ago and it was in perfect condition ! I went yesterday and hooked it up to tmobile . This phone is perfect no flaws at all. The seller is awesome as well and even checked in with me after the phone was delievered to make sure I was happy! Thank you so much .,5
Phone was blocked by T-Mobile as payment was not made for the phone or it was stolen. Service was disconnected once T-Mobile tracked the serial number. We are sending back to Amazon for refund.,1
My sister bought this on my account and she loves this phone. It's her first iphone and she really likes the quality of them! She did have to replace the screen because they are very fragile but they are very great phones!,5
"Awesome replacement phone for my sister who lost her phone in a car accident. She's used to having a Galaxy and it seems like she likes the iPhone a lot more which is a relief as I am an iPhone user myself. It arrived without a charger or headphones so that sucks but the phone was in good shape. No scratches, dings, or dents.",5
Phone came quickly and was basically new. There was small scratch on the back but I quickly bought a case to prevent future damages. I just popped in my SIM card and the phone was ready to go! I did have to change the default language from Spanish to English but other than that it was a breeze!,5
"This phone worked perfectly for 1 month and then had no service. After going to T-Mobile for help, they discovered this phone was never paid for by the original owner and shut off. This is fraud!!",1
NOT A T-MOBILE IPHONE. ITS UNLOCKED! SERVICE IS POTATO AND THE PHONE IS SLOW AND LAGGY. THE SIDE BUTTONS WORK AND DONT WORK. BOUGHT 2 BOTH GAVE SAME ISSUES,1
I left negative feed back of how frustrating the process take when you received a defective item.overall they did a good job replacing my phone when something did not work and did what needed to be done.great job guys,5
the review said good condition but it came with a lot of scratches it was not unlocked and i have to buy a new charger because the charger that came with it . it was not charging/working,2
The charger provided by the manufacturer was defective. The phone wouldn't charge until I used a friends cable. I purchased a new USB cable and now it is charging properly. Extra expense.,3
"Came as described, could tell it was used but not really noticeable unless inspected closely. Purchased for my mom and she's fallen in love with it, easier to use than her previous android. It was unlocked so was able to connect to Walmarts FamilyMobile service.",5
"Great phone bought for my teen daughter, was able to connect phone with T-mobile just as described during purchase. Phone was delivered on time also no scratches too",5
I've had this phone since August 2014 and I've had zero problems with it. I feel bad for those that did have problems with it getting shut off. Maybe it's cause I bought it for 500$ not long after it came out.,5
I purchased this phone for my niece - I went to Tmobile to get it turned on with service plan and I was told it was blocked because it was stolen and I couldn't get it turned on after spending $80.00 with Tmobile.I am completely disappointed.,1
NEVER WILL I MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN!! Im a single mom trying to save $ ordered my son this phone to find out it was STOLEN upon taking it to the T-Mobile store to activate....Pay retail and save yourself a lot of problems!!!,1
Worked fine for about two and a half months and then it stopped working. I contacted T-Mobile and they informed me that the previous owner had not paid their bill and the phone is now shut off and reported stolen. This is fraud!!!,1
I would give zero stars they sent me 3 phones n all 3 phone didn't work n they even told merge phones r expired n the batteries dead so y do u take our. 400$ rip off,1
This is a terrible place to get a product. Very poor product quality control. I received an iPhone that was visibly broken with the hassle of having to return. This is not worth you time.,1

Phone came quickly and was basically new. There was small scratch on the back but I quickly bought a case to prevent future damages. I just popped in my SIM card and the phone was ready to go! I did have to change the default language from Spanish to English but other than that it was a breeze!,5
"This phone worked perfectly for 1 month and then had no service. After going to T-Mobile for help, they discovered this phone was never paid for by the original owner and shut off. This is fraud!!",1
NEVER WILL I MAKE THIS MISTAKE AGAIN!! Im a single mom trying to save $ ordered my son this phone to find out it was STOLEN upon taking it to the T-Mobile store to activate....Pay retail and save yourself a lot of problems!!!,1
Worked fine for about two and a half months and then it stopped working. I contacted T-Mobile and they informed me that the previous owner had not paid their bill and the phone is now shut off and reported stolen. This is fraud!!!,1
Phone was blocked by T-Mobile as payment was not made for the phone or it was stolen. Service was disconnected once T-Mobile tracked the serial number. We are sending back to Amazon for refund.,1
Got this phone a few days ago and it was in perfect condition ! I went yesterday and hooked it up to tmobile . This phone is perfect no flaws at all. The seller is awesome as well and even checked in with me after the phone was delievered to make sure I was happy! Thank you so much .,5
"Awesome replacement phone for my sister who lost her phone in a car accident. She's used to having a Galaxy and it seems like she likes the iPhone a lot more which is a relief as I am an iPhone user myself. It arrived without a charger or headphones so that sucks but the phone was in good shape. No scratches, dings, or dents.",5
I would give zero stars they sent me 3 phones n all 3 phone didn't work n they even told merge phones r expired n the batteries dead so y do u take our. 400$ rip off,1
This is a terrible place to get a product. Very poor product quality control. I received an iPhone that was visibly broken with the hassle of having to return. This is not worth you time.,1
My sister bought this on my account and she loves this phone. It's her first iphone and she really likes the quality of them! She did have to replace the screen because they are very fragile but they are very great phones!,5
I've had this phone since August 2014 and I've had zero problems with it. I feel bad for those that did have problems with it getting shut off. Maybe it's cause I bought it for 500$ not long after it came out.,5
I purchased this phone for my niece - I went to Tmobile to get it turned on with service plan and I was told it was blocked because it was stolen and I couldn't get it turned on after spending $80.00 with Tmobile.I am completely disappointed.,1
This phone came packaged VERY WELL . It also does work FANTASIC. It also is unlocked ☺️. Love the product/device. Hopefully it will continue to work and hold up well after today .,5

NOT A T-MOBILE IPHONE. ITS UNLOCKED! SERVICE IS POTATO AND THE PHONE IS SLOW AND LAGGY. THE SIDE BUTTONS WORK AND DONT WORK. BOUGHT 2 BOTH GAVE SAME ISSUES,1
I left negative feed back of how frustrating the process take when you received a defective item.overall they did a good job replacing my phone when something did not work and did what needed to be done.great job guys,5
the review said good condition but it came with a lot of scratches it was not unlocked and i have to buy a new charger because the charger that came with it . it was not charging/working,2
The charger provided by the manufacturer was defective. The phone wouldn't charge until I used a friends cable. I purchased a new USB cable and now it is charging properly. Extra expense.,3

"wow !! I wasn't expecting this phone to come so fast , I love it only had one Scratch , and came with 3 Chargers , 6 screen protectors and even a car charger !! I will be buying from this seller again & again , THANK YOU !",5
Yes will buy from again phone was spot on as described and fast shiping lovely purchase and great price...very satisfied he just uses it for wifi so fit our needs u do need to buy a sim card but 25 bucks at walmart and we were good to go😉,5
"I was expecting to receive junk with the price so low. However, this product arrived in GREAT condition, the color is vibrant, no scratches, cracks or visible wear. My daughter says it works PERFECT! This phone is in BETTER condition than described. Amazon Needs More Sellers Like YOU!",5
I bought this for my 11 year old son. The color is great and it meets his needs. He is very happy with it. The only thing I dont like is that the Visual Voicemail doesnt work on it. I dont know if that is a problem with the carrier or the phone. Luckily he doesnt need it.,4
Vibration is strongEarpiece and speakerphone is crispButtons are firmPorts are clean of lint and liquids.ESN is clean.Battery holds a good chargeRadio signals are good,5
"this phone is not new, it is a refurbished phone, mine after 2 month it crash and i took it to the apple store and they told me it is refurbished and doesn't have any guarantee from apple.",1

Got my phone a little while ago and had a little bit of trouble with getting it over and working on Metro PCS . But I got it and am finally #teamiphone !,5
"No problem getting this phone turn on by metro pcs. Works great and my daughter loved it for her birthday. Also, came in the date I was suppose to receive it by.",5
I was so skeptical to buy a used phone off here BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! Not a scratch on it and works perfect! Don't buy from anyone else saved so much money and I'm very satisfied,5
"Scam! When I was buying it, it was a sim card, not iPhone! It costed 1 cent and didn't worked. They did it to get reviewes and now are changing description. What a shame!",1
The phone is beautiful work lovely and no scratches All I have to do is put my Sim card and turn it on and goes work right away I Gave this a five-star cousin I have no problem with it,5
This phone works just fine and as described by the seller. There was not a scratch on it when I received it. I am very satisfied with this phone and would buy from this seller again.,4
"I want to know how to have a feedback or return a product that went wrong , buy a iPhone 5c and the start button and a front camera that I do not work",2
"This has been a great cell phone. Price was reasonable and since it was unlocked, was simple to set up service with our carrier. Love the look of the phone (blue) and a good size to fit in pocket, purse, etc.",5
"Arrived in perfect condition; no problem setting up and works like it's brand new. Buying a used phone can be a scary proposition, but this seller is honest/safe.",5
"ordered it and it came on time, nothing wrong with the phone. it only cost $15 for a sim card to activate your phone or switch phones (same carrier). truly decent.((my carrier is t-mobile))",5
I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far. Otherwise its a decent iPhone and arrived on time through Amazon Prime which is a terrific service,3
"the phone arrived as described in great condition. it was ready to go to a sprint store and get signed up for a sprint account, etc. I'm using it and loving it! no issues with getting a sim card, etc.",5
The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping.,1
"Got it in great shape. Love it. A faulty charger cable caused a bit of a scare, but otherwise, got a quality product for a decent price. Very satisfied.",4
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4
"The phone powered on once, shut off and did not turn back on. The time it did come on, I got a ""white screen of death"" and had to manually restart it. This was incredibly frustrating and irritating.",1
"I got this phone day before yesterday. Arrived on time. The phone was sealed and is brand new. Loved it. I bought it for my mother in India. So, I will have to take it to India and check if it works with the service providers there. It should, hopefully. :)",5
The phone was brand new as advertised but it wasn't factory unlocked. I had to return it. I guess I am gonna stop buying electronic devices through amazon,3
Really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. I would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. Thanks!,5
Love my phone . It was used but it look brand NEW! The only thing I wasn't impressed with is that she sent me fake iPhone headsets but that's okay. Overall great seller. I recommend this seller. @Sharri International Inc 'i got the green one ',5
Only had fone for about month and it was stolen. I'm out all that money. No one would do anything for me. Even a discount when I'm ready to purchase another fone. I just felt something could of been done that's a lot of money to be out,1
I was skeptical when I bought this product. It works perfectly. The seller also asked any questions that may arise after purchasing the product. Excellent quality and shipped fast. I highly recommend it,5
Thank goodness the phone worked. However the earphones were not the original apple earphones; they looked very cheap and you can tell they aren't from apple.,2
"This is my first iphone ever and I'm 100% satisfied. This iPhone 5c came earlier than it was supposed to arrive, looking brand new, unlocked, with 3 chargers, screen cases, headphones (not regular iPhone headphones though). All in all, I'm a happy camper.",5
Nice looking phone as usual buy Apple just screwed me up yet again with the phone memory it said it was 8gb and turned out to be 5.4 to be precise. Why do they keep shoving us up all their stupid apps that No one ever uses,1
I like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top. Also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that. I can say other than that it is a good phone.,3
Great iPhone 5C for a used one! Has a few miner scratches but if it wasn't cause of that would off gave it 5 stars. Other than that no complaints works well.,4
The phone I received was defective. The home button does not work. It did arrive a day earlier than expected. Phone powers on and all but cannot exit any app. Cannot return to home screen. Phone is useless. I have to power it off then back on again to get to home screen.,1
I just got my phone today and it keeps freezing I have to lock it than unlock it so it will act right ..I'm so upset and I waited for this phone for so long ..just hope I don't have to pay to get another one,1
"I purchased three phones each phone is in good condition, arrival time was great, received current update from apple, so far so good from three teenagers.",5
Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don't like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one.,2
excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much.,5
You will not get a 1 yr Apple warranty with this purchase. My phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. I contacted Apple and was told it was already replaced. I contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. Horrible experience. Will never buy from this seller.,1
My phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. Not to mention 2 of my letters won't work when I'm typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself,2
"The screen had a sort of smudge in the center. We bought the telephone for testing, so we can live with that. But is a defect that wasn't advertised and in my opinion that's not ""very good"" quality.",2
"Do not buy this phone. It is USELESS I REPEAT IT IS USELESS. The screen does not work. These people sell BASURAR on amazon. I don't know y amazon grants them the permission to sell cheap, useless and garbage product on their site.",1
"In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You'd never know this phone wasn't brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!!",5
I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it,1
"Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.",2
"8GB iPhone is USELESS. iOS takes up nearly /2 the storage -- the device is maxed out after few pictures, songs and chats. DON'T BUY AN 8GB IPHONE!!! Expensive lesson learned.",1
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I was so worried that it would not be what we expected it to be per online pics, but it was! My 2nd worry was whether or not I could get it activated with Metro PCS and of course I was! MY DAUGHTER HAS NO COMPLAINTS>>What u see is what you get! Love It!",5
Great phone! Down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. Learned this the hard way. I'm an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. Spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must.,5
"Initially had some issues with the phone not being unlocked, seller contacted me and rectified the situation. Phone works great and I am very happy with the product, especially the customer service.",5
I purchased 2 of these phones in early Dec 2016. Both phones could not be activated by Verizon. Wasted a lot of my time with Verizona customer support. Very angry.,1
"Perfect size for ease of use, easy to drop the phone with big screen. I thought the plastic material on the back can cause scratch easily, it's actually very not the case.",5
"I ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, I got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. I'm thinking about returning it, but I can't go without a phone for long and I'm not sure how long it'll take for them to get me the right one. I'm bummed out.",1
"Not even 4 months into owning this phone has it stopped working, well I have no screen. I am getting texts and calls, I just can't respond to them. Not pleased at all!!!!!!",1
Phone was listed as like new but when we tried to activate it the camera didn't work and you could make a call but the person you were calling couldn't hear you,1
We purchased this item as a gift on Christmas 2014 and this item is still in use. Works like a charm with no problems. Item new in box with all accessories included. Excellent performance quality even in the middle of nowhere. It has been a great phone. We would again purchase the same item from the same seller.,5
"in the description it said it was unlocked but the sim card was locked to att, I had to go to a lot of trouble just to try and unlock the from from att, I had to go in the store presonnally and it took forever. but the phone it self is good.",3
This phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn't go through. I can't return because window has been closed. Apple won't replace because I didn't purchase from them. I'm out $300. I recommend you do not buy!,1
"The phone works great!!! Although, a few days after I received the phone, the charger that came with it stopped working. I was sent a new charger and it charges my phone very slowly. I let them know again and they are sending me another charger. They help solve their customers problems and I highly recommend you buy their products. HAPPY BUYING (:",5
"Perfect all the way around but if you are a big music fan I recommend getting the one with moré storage, this iPhone has 13 apps and I can only fit about 80 songs",5
"Interestingly, the phone actually came with a Verizon simcard though it claims it will not work with Verizon. My from the big apple is model A1532 which is prossibly an verizon unlocked version. I tested it with my H2O prepaid card and it works well though. Hope this help.",4
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use.,5
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition.,3
"Phone was NOT NEW as described. Phone stopped working after 8 months. When I took it to the Apple store they told me my phone was a ""Franken-Phone"" made up of parts from many old phones. Apple will not repair it and I seriously doubt I will see my money again. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!",1
"Might be unlucky because this phone itself is unfuctional. It doesn't open half the time when I click the power or home button, sometimes I even flick the mute button for it to work but it doesn't. It only opens when I recieve a call",1
"Sold as new, but I don't think it was. The key to open the sim card slot was missing and there was already a sim card in the phone. Otherwise, all is working well.",2
"The phone arrived extremely fast in just 2 business days, which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected, almost new. It runs great. It arrived with everything the seller said it would in the listing. This was a great buy. I am extremely happy.",5
"I'm Having problems receiving calls with this phone...the calls go straight to the voice mail. not every single call though, some friends say that they had to call twice or three times to reach me...I get notifications for missed calls and I can see who called me, but still it's a frustrating problem to have!",1
"i bought this product and i choose the option ''new'' now it results its refubrished. it doesnt have warranty anymore, i bought it 4 months ago. What can i do if a need the warranty now. i need an answer",1
"Purchased this for my mom. She loves it.. came when promised. Arrived in immaculate condition. Flawless.. unlocked as promised, everything works no issues, for $150 best iphone 5 u will get. . Charger included. No complaints",5
I order this phone as a gift for my niece. I was really unsure to get this on Amazon because I never got an iPhone other than the Apple Store but ended up being a good experience. This is my review:1. Works good.2. The outside conditions are 9/10.3. Software ok!4. Fast delivery5. Headphones and charger works perfect,5
"The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there's a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer",2
IPhone 5c is extremely slow on current iOS. If I take about 30 Pictures and couple of videos the storage is full. It was a mistake buying an 8GB phone.,1
"This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed",3
I got my phone yesterday it looked brand new my Sims card counldnt fit in it so I took it to the store got exchange for a pink one but overall the phone look brand new no scratches,3
I was skeptical when I bought this product. It works perfectly. The seller also asked any questions that may arise after purchasing the product. Excellent quality and shipped fast. I highly recommend it,5
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4
"This phone was a great price, and works as intended. i have always been and android user, this is my first IPhone and it works great. i also love the color.",4
"Awesome!!!It had a couple of scuff marks along the edges but other than that I was very pleasantly surprised. It was very affordable, ecspecially for a 14 year old with a small job...so happy....",5
I ended up taking the phone to Walmart and asked them if they could activate it. The employee inserted a new SIM card in it and activated it thru their Straight Talk wireless. When the only carrier in my small town couldn't or either wouldn't do it. Now it works fine! Will not be sending it back after all.,4
"the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used",2
We purchased this item as a gift on Christmas 2014 and this item is still in use. Works like a charm with no problems. Item new in box with all accessories included. Excellent performance quality even in the middle of nowhere. It has been a great phone. We would again purchase the same item from the same seller.,5
"This was a nightmare. The phone was not unlocked, and it took me forever to try to activate it. Then I found out it was because the phone was reported as STOLEN. I had to send it back and purchase a different phone. Never again will I buy a phone online",1
"It came in excellent condition, runs very good, only sidenote would be a slight scuff on the Sim card tray but other than that very good phone 10/10 would recommend",4
"This product came earlier than the expected date. Mines were as cheap as 85 dollars , the only difficult is that i needed a sim card to activate my Phone luckily my cousin was there to let me borrow hers . phone came perfectly no scratches or nothing , a charger came with it so i recommend any body to purchase from this seller",5
I was worried at first considering the low price but I'm very happy with the my 5c it had very very small scratches and I was able to put an ATT sim in before switching to cricket wireless.no problems.5 stars all day.,5
"The seller is very trustworthy, I received the phone safe and sound with no issues on it except that whenever there's pressure on a certain area of the phone screen the screen will kind of go in and out. Very minor detail and doesn't affect phone at all, it just shows that the phone has had its screen replaced before selling.",4
"Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.",2

I personally prefer the androids but my daughter loved this phone! It was everything she wanted and I got it at a really good price! It does what she needs and all the extras that she wants. We are happy!,5
Really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. I would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. Thanks!,5
Love my phone . It was used but it look brand NEW! The only thing I wasn't impressed with is that she sent me fake iPhone headsets but that's okay. Overall great seller. I recommend this seller. @Sharri International Inc 'i got the green one ',5
"It came very fast, cute phone and of course amazing Apple quality, the only weird thing is that even the phone was new, it came with a sim card inside of the phone...",4
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4
"in the description it said it was unlocked but the sim card was locked to att, I had to go to a lot of trouble just to try and unlock the from from att, I had to go in the store presonnally and it took forever. but the phone it self is good.",3
The phone is beautiful work lovely and no scratches All I have to do is put my Sim card and turn it on and goes work right away I Gave this a five-star cousin I have no problem with it,5
This phone works just fine and as described by the seller. There was not a scratch on it when I received it. I am very satisfied with this phone and would buy from this seller again.,4
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4
Leary at first puchasing a used phone however couldn't be happier. Looks almost brand new and no problems at all with use. Will start with a used phone from this seller next time shopping for a phone.,5
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use.,5
"In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You'd never know this phone wasn't brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!!",5
"The phone works great!!! Although, a few days after I received the phone, the charger that came with it stopped working. I was sent a new charger and it charges my phone very slowly. I let them know again and they are sending me another charger. They help solve their customers problems and I highly recommend you buy their products. HAPPY BUYING (:",5
"Perfect all the way around but if you are a big music fan I recommend getting the one with moré storage, this iPhone has 13 apps and I can only fit about 80 songs",5
"Got it in great shape. Love it. A faulty charger cable caused a bit of a scare, but otherwise, got a quality product for a decent price. Very satisfied.",4
"recieved this phone today, when i started to set it up I couldnt as it told me it had to be activated by a certain icloud account which was not mine!!!!!!!",1
I was so skeptical to buy a used phone off here BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! Not a scratch on it and works perfect! Don't buy from anyone else saved so much money and I'm very satisfied,5
"i bought this product and i choose the option ''new'' now it results its refubrished. it doesnt have warranty anymore, i bought it 4 months ago. What can i do if a need the warranty now. i need an answer",1
"Purchased this for my mom. She loves it.. came when promised. Arrived in immaculate condition. Flawless.. unlocked as promised, everything works no issues, for $150 best iphone 5 u will get. . Charger included. No complaints",5
The phone was brand new as advertised but it wasn't factory unlocked. I had to return it. I guess I am gonna stop buying electronic devices through amazon,3
"This phone was a great price, and works as intended. i have always been and android user, this is my first IPhone and it works great. i also love the color.",4
"Awesome!!!It had a couple of scuff marks along the edges but other than that I was very pleasantly surprised. It was very affordable, ecspecially for a 14 year old with a small job...so happy....",5
"Scam! When I was buying it, it was a sim card, not iPhone! It costed 1 cent and didn't worked. They did it to get reviewes and now are changing description. What a shame!",1
I order this phone as a gift for my niece. I was really unsure to get this on Amazon because I never got an iPhone other than the Apple Store but ended up being a good experience. This is my review:1. Works good.2. The outside conditions are 9/10.3. Software ok!4. Fast delivery5. Headphones and charger works perfect,5
"The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there's a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer",2
IPhone 5c is extremely slow on current iOS. If I take about 30 Pictures and couple of videos the storage is full. It was a mistake buying an 8GB phone.,1
I like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top. Also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that. I can say other than that it is a good phone.,3
Great iPhone 5C for a used one! Has a few miner scratches but if it wasn't cause of that would off gave it 5 stars. Other than that no complaints works well.,4
The phone I received was defective. The home button does not work. It did arrive a day earlier than expected. Phone powers on and all but cannot exit any app. Cannot return to home screen. Phone is useless. I have to power it off then back on again to get to home screen.,1
"No problem getting this phone turn on by metro pcs. Works great and my daughter loved it for her birthday. Also, came in the date I was suppose to receive it by.",5
"bought this as a gift for my mom's bday, she absolutely adores it, much better than her previous iphone 4, fast and sleek, standard apple product, i might get the pink for myself, shipped super quick, will do business again",4
"This was the best buy for my situation, did not want to give my current phone carrier. They were able to activate this iphone with no problems. thank you.",5
"This was a nightmare. The phone was not unlocked, and it took me forever to try to activate it. Then I found out it was because the phone was reported as STOLEN. I had to send it back and purchase a different phone. Never again will I buy a phone online",1
"It came in excellent condition, runs very good, only sidenote would be a slight scuff on the Sim card tray but other than that very good phone 10/10 would recommend",4
My phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. Not to mention 2 of my letters won't work when I'm typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself,2
Got my phone a little while ago and had a little bit of trouble with getting it over and working on Metro PCS . But I got it and am finally #teamiphone !,5
I purchased 2 of these phones in early Dec 2016. Both phones could not be activated by Verizon. Wasted a lot of my time with Verizona customer support. Very angry.,1
"Perfect size for ease of use, easy to drop the phone with big screen. I thought the plastic material on the back can cause scratch easily, it's actually very not the case.",5
I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it,1
"The seller is very trustworthy, I received the phone safe and sound with no issues on it except that whenever there's pressure on a certain area of the phone screen the screen will kind of go in and out. Very minor detail and doesn't affect phone at all, it just shows that the phone has had its screen replaced before selling.",4
"Phone was NOT NEW as described. Phone stopped working after 8 months. When I took it to the Apple store they told me my phone was a ""Franken-Phone"" made up of parts from many old phones. Apple will not repair it and I seriously doubt I will see my money again. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!",1
"Might be unlucky because this phone itself is unfuctional. It doesn't open half the time when I click the power or home button, sometimes I even flick the mute button for it to work but it doesn't. It only opens when I recieve a call",1
I just got my phone today and it keeps freezing I have to lock it than unlock it so it will act right ..I'm so upset and I waited for this phone for so long ..just hope I don't have to pay to get another one,1
"I purchased three phones each phone is in good condition, arrival time was great, received current update from apple, so far so good from three teenagers.",5
Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don't like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one.,2
excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much.,5
You will not get a 1 yr Apple warranty with this purchase. My phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. I contacted Apple and was told it was already replaced. I contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. Horrible experience. Will never buy from this seller.,1
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4
Thank goodness the phone worked. However the earphones were not the original apple earphones; they looked very cheap and you can tell they aren't from apple.,2
"This is my first iphone ever and I'm 100% satisfied. This iPhone 5c came earlier than it was supposed to arrive, looking brand new, unlocked, with 3 chargers, screen cases, headphones (not regular iPhone headphones though). All in all, I'm a happy camper.",5
Nice looking phone as usual buy Apple just screwed me up yet again with the phone memory it said it was 8gb and turned out to be 5.4 to be precise. Why do they keep shoving us up all their stupid apps that No one ever uses,1
"This product came earlier than the expected date. Mines were as cheap as 85 dollars , the only difficult is that i needed a sim card to activate my Phone luckily my cousin was there to let me borrow hers . phone came perfectly no scratches or nothing , a charger came with it so i recommend any body to purchase from this seller",5
I was worried at first considering the low price but I'm very happy with the my 5c it had very very small scratches and I was able to put an ATT sim in before switching to cricket wireless.no problems.5 stars all day.,5
Only had fone for about month and it was stolen. I'm out all that money. No one would do anything for me. Even a discount when I'm ready to purchase another fone. I just felt something could of been done that's a lot of money to be out,1
"The screen had a sort of smudge in the center. We bought the telephone for testing, so we can live with that. But is a defect that wasn't advertised and in my opinion that's not ""very good"" quality.",2
"Do not buy this phone. It is USELESS I REPEAT IT IS USELESS. The screen does not work. These people sell BASURAR on amazon. I don't know y amazon grants them the permission to sell cheap, useless and garbage product on their site.",1
Phone was listed as like new but when we tried to activate it the camera didn't work and you could make a call but the person you were calling couldn't hear you,1
"I want to know how to have a feedback or return a product that went wrong , buy a iPhone 5c and the start button and a front camera that I do not work",2
"This has been a great cell phone. Price was reasonable and since it was unlocked, was simple to set up service with our carrier. Love the look of the phone (blue) and a good size to fit in pocket, purse, etc.",5
"Arrived in perfect condition; no problem setting up and works like it's brand new. Buying a used phone can be a scary proposition, but this seller is honest/safe.",5
"This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed",3
I got my phone yesterday it looked brand new my Sims card counldnt fit in it so I took it to the store got exchange for a pink one but overall the phone look brand new no scratches,3
I was skeptical when I bought this product. It works perfectly. The seller also asked any questions that may arise after purchasing the product. Excellent quality and shipped fast. I highly recommend it,5
"I ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, I got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. I'm thinking about returning it, but I can't go without a phone for long and I'm not sure how long it'll take for them to get me the right one. I'm bummed out.",1
"Not even 4 months into owning this phone has it stopped working, well I have no screen. I am getting texts and calls, I just can't respond to them. Not pleased at all!!!!!!",1
I'm wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound...,1
The phone is beautiful work lovely and no scratches All I have to do is put my Sim card and turn it on and goes work right away I Gave this a five-star cousin I have no problem with it,5
This phone works just fine and as described by the seller. There was not a scratch on it when I received it. I am very satisfied with this phone and would buy from this seller again.,4
"Initially had some issues with the phone not being unlocked, seller contacted me and rectified the situation. Phone works great and I am very happy with the product, especially the customer service.",5
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition.,3
"I bought Apple I Phone for my mom as a gift, unfortunately it didn't work. I contact seller and I receive refund. I am very happy with customer service. I have never had so nice and understanding service.",4
"Flawless Phone!!! A+++++ besides it being practically new I got it real quick and took 2 minutes to activate with my carrier! Will do business again in a heartbeat! Thanks ""CELLAS""",5
"iphone was indeed unlocked. there was a slight misfit with my charger, but it was promptly replaced by the seller. phone looks good. needs a nano sim - you will need to buy your own for a buck, typically. absolutely new",5
This phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn't go through. I can't return because window has been closed. Apple won't replace because I didn't purchase from them. I'm out $300. I recommend you do not buy!,1
"Sold as new, but I don't think it was. The key to open the sim card slot was missing and there was already a sim card in the phone. Otherwise, all is working well.",2
"The phone arrived extremely fast in just 2 business days, which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected, almost new. It runs great. It arrived with everything the seller said it would in the listing. This was a great buy. I am extremely happy.",5
I ended up taking the phone to Walmart and asked them if they could activate it. The employee inserted a new SIM card in it and activated it thru their Straight Talk wireless. When the only carrier in my small town couldn't or either wouldn't do it. Now it works fine! Will not be sending it back after all.,4
"the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used",2
We purchased this item as a gift on Christmas 2014 and this item is still in use. Works like a charm with no problems. Item new in box with all accessories included. Excellent performance quality even in the middle of nowhere. It has been a great phone. We would again purchase the same item from the same seller.,5
"Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.",2
"8GB iPhone is USELESS. iOS takes up nearly /2 the storage -- the device is maxed out after few pictures, songs and chats. DON'T BUY AN 8GB IPHONE!!! Expensive lesson learned.",1
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I was so worried that it would not be what we expected it to be per online pics, but it was! My 2nd worry was whether or not I could get it activated with Metro PCS and of course I was! MY DAUGHTER HAS NO COMPLAINTS>>What u see is what you get! Love It!",5
Great phone! Down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. Learned this the hard way. I'm an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. Spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must.,5
I personally prefer the androids but my daughter loved this phone! It was everything she wanted and I got it at a really good price! It does what she needs and all the extras that she wants. We are happy!,5
"Purchased for my daughter for t mobile prepaid service. Had to purchase a micro sim card from tmobile and phone worked perfectly. Phone did not come in the standard iphone white box I'm used to, but upon opening it phone looked new and had all the plastic coverings a new phone should have.",5
"Got a great price for iphone 5c. Was delivered in two days, brand new as advertised and my daughter loves it. It works great with AT&T and I get to keep the same plan without having to do the AT&T upgrade for my daughter which is even better deal.",5
"Interestingly, the phone actually came with a Verizon simcard though it claims it will not work with Verizon. My from the big apple is model A1532 which is prossibly an verizon unlocked version. I tested it with my H2O prepaid card and it works well though. Hope this help.",4
"in the description it said it was unlocked but the sim card was locked to att, I had to go to a lot of trouble just to try and unlock the from from att, I had to go in the store presonnally and it took forever. but the phone it self is good.",3
"ordered it and it came on time, nothing wrong with the phone. it only cost $15 for a sim card to activate your phone or switch phones (same carrier). truly decent.((my carrier is t-mobile))",5
I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far. Otherwise its a decent iPhone and arrived on time through Amazon Prime which is a terrific service,3
"I'm Having problems receiving calls with this phone...the calls go straight to the voice mail. not every single call though, some friends say that they had to call twice or three times to reach me...I get notifications for missed calls and I can see who called me, but still it's a frustrating problem to have!",1
"I got this phone day before yesterday. Arrived on time. The phone was sealed and is brand new. Loved it. I bought it for my mother in India. So, I will have to take it to India and check if it works with the service providers there. It should, hopefully. :)",5
"the phone arrived as described in great condition. it was ready to go to a sprint store and get signed up for a sprint account, etc. I'm using it and loving it! no issues with getting a sim card, etc.",5
The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping.,1
"The phone powered on once, shut off and did not turn back on. The time it did come on, I got a ""white screen of death"" and had to manually restart it. This was incredibly frustrating and irritating.",1
Really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. I would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. Thanks!,5

"It came very fast, cute phone and of course amazing Apple quality, the only weird thing is that even the phone was new, it came with a sim card inside of the phone...",4
The phone looked like it went through a blender. Deep scratches all over the blue part. Turned the phone on and there was nothing but a line down the side of it. Returned for refund.,1
This was an amazing buy. I was very skeptical considering that its risky to buy a used phone.The phone is exactly as it was advertised. Shipped fast.Its been more than 3 months now and never experienced any issues.,5
"For the price, this is an excellent entry level iOS phone.Its interesting that this phone is cheaper than a new iPod touch.Sister dropped her 4s in the toilet, this was a great replacement to that.",5
Totally better than I expected it to be. Fully functional with no problems what so ever. There is minimal wear and tear but you can barely see it. Will definitely be ordering from you guys again soon!,5

I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it,1
"The phone works great!!! Although, a few days after I received the phone, the charger that came with it stopped working. I was sent a new charger and it charges my phone very slowly. I let them know again and they are sending me another charger. They help solve their customers problems and I highly recommend you buy their products. HAPPY BUYING (:",5
"Perfect all the way around but if you are a big music fan I recommend getting the one with moré storage, this iPhone has 13 apps and I can only fit about 80 songs",5
"For the price, this is an excellent entry level iOS phone.Its interesting that this phone is cheaper than a new iPod touch.Sister dropped her 4s in the toilet, this was a great replacement to that.",5
Totally better than I expected it to be. Fully functional with no problems what so ever. There is minimal wear and tear but you can barely see it. Will definitely be ordering from you guys again soon!,5
"This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed",3
I got my phone yesterday it looked brand new my Sims card counldnt fit in it so I took it to the store got exchange for a pink one but overall the phone look brand new no scratches,3
I was skeptical when I bought this product. It works perfectly. The seller also asked any questions that may arise after purchasing the product. Excellent quality and shipped fast. I highly recommend it,5
"This product came earlier than the expected date. Mines were as cheap as 85 dollars , the only difficult is that i needed a sim card to activate my Phone luckily my cousin was there to let me borrow hers . phone came perfectly no scratches or nothing , a charger came with it so i recommend any body to purchase from this seller",5
I was worried at first considering the low price but I'm very happy with the my 5c it had very very small scratches and I was able to put an ATT sim in before switching to cricket wireless.no problems.5 stars all day.,5
"Phone was NOT NEW as described. Phone stopped working after 8 months. When I took it to the Apple store they told me my phone was a ""Franken-Phone"" made up of parts from many old phones. Apple will not repair it and I seriously doubt I will see my money again. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!",1
"Might be unlucky because this phone itself is unfuctional. It doesn't open half the time when I click the power or home button, sometimes I even flick the mute button for it to work but it doesn't. It only opens when I recieve a call",1
The phone looked like it went through a blender. Deep scratches all over the blue part. Turned the phone on and there was nothing but a line down the side of it. Returned for refund.,1
This was an amazing buy. I was very skeptical considering that its risky to buy a used phone.The phone is exactly as it was advertised. Shipped fast.Its been more than 3 months now and never experienced any issues.,5
"The screen had a sort of smudge in the center. We bought the telephone for testing, so we can live with that. But is a defect that wasn't advertised and in my opinion that's not ""very good"" quality.",2
"Do not buy this phone. It is USELESS I REPEAT IT IS USELESS. The screen does not work. These people sell BASURAR on amazon. I don't know y amazon grants them the permission to sell cheap, useless and garbage product on their site.",1
Phone was listed as like new but when we tried to activate it the camera didn't work and you could make a call but the person you were calling couldn't hear you,1

"In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You'd never know this phone wasn't brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!!",5
"Got it in great shape. Love it. A faulty charger cable caused a bit of a scare, but otherwise, got a quality product for a decent price. Very satisfied.",4
I purchased 2 of these phones in early Dec 2016. Both phones could not be activated by Verizon. Wasted a lot of my time with Verizona customer support. Very angry.,1

The phone is beautiful work lovely and no scratches All I have to do is put my Sim card and turn it on and goes work right away I Gave this a five-star cousin I have no problem with it,5
This phone works just fine and as described by the seller. There was not a scratch on it when I received it. I am very satisfied with this phone and would buy from this seller again.,4
"This phone was a great price, and works as intended. i have always been and android user, this is my first IPhone and it works great. i also love the color.",4
"Awesome!!!It had a couple of scuff marks along the edges but other than that I was very pleasantly surprised. It was very affordable, ecspecially for a 14 year old with a small job...so happy....",5
I ended up taking the phone to Walmart and asked them if they could activate it. The employee inserted a new SIM card in it and activated it thru their Straight Talk wireless. When the only carrier in my small town couldn't or either wouldn't do it. Now it works fine! Will not be sending it back after all.,4
"the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used",2
We purchased this item as a gift on Christmas 2014 and this item is still in use. Works like a charm with no problems. Item new in box with all accessories included. Excellent performance quality even in the middle of nowhere. It has been a great phone. We would again purchase the same item from the same seller.,5
"The seller is very trustworthy, I received the phone safe and sound with no issues on it except that whenever there's pressure on a certain area of the phone screen the screen will kind of go in and out. Very minor detail and doesn't affect phone at all, it just shows that the phone has had its screen replaced before selling.",4
"recieved this phone today, when i started to set it up I couldnt as it told me it had to be activated by a certain icloud account which was not mine!!!!!!!",1
"Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.",2
"8GB iPhone is USELESS. iOS takes up nearly /2 the storage -- the device is maxed out after few pictures, songs and chats. DON'T BUY AN 8GB IPHONE!!! Expensive lesson learned.",1
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I was so worried that it would not be what we expected it to be per online pics, but it was! My 2nd worry was whether or not I could get it activated with Metro PCS and of course I was! MY DAUGHTER HAS NO COMPLAINTS>>What u see is what you get! Love It!",5
Great phone! Down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. Learned this the hard way. I'm an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. Spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must.,5
I personally prefer the androids but my daughter loved this phone! It was everything she wanted and I got it at a really good price! It does what she needs and all the extras that she wants. We are happy!,5
The phone was brand new as advertised but it wasn't factory unlocked. I had to return it. I guess I am gonna stop buying electronic devices through amazon,3
"Sold as new, but I don't think it was. The key to open the sim card slot was missing and there was already a sim card in the phone. Otherwise, all is working well.",2
"The phone arrived extremely fast in just 2 business days, which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected, almost new. It runs great. It arrived with everything the seller said it would in the listing. This was a great buy. I am extremely happy.",5
"This was a nightmare. The phone was not unlocked, and it took me forever to try to activate it. Then I found out it was because the phone was reported as STOLEN. I had to send it back and purchase a different phone. Never again will I buy a phone online",1
"It came in excellent condition, runs very good, only sidenote would be a slight scuff on the Sim card tray but other than that very good phone 10/10 would recommend",4
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use.,5
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4
I like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top. Also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that. I can say other than that it is a good phone.,3
Great iPhone 5C for a used one! Has a few miner scratches but if it wasn't cause of that would off gave it 5 stars. Other than that no complaints works well.,4
The phone I received was defective. The home button does not work. It did arrive a day earlier than expected. Phone powers on and all but cannot exit any app. Cannot return to home screen. Phone is useless. I have to power it off then back on again to get to home screen.,1
Phone was listed as like new but when we tried to activate it the camera didn't work and you could make a call but the person you were calling couldn't hear you,1
"the phone arrived as described in great condition. it was ready to go to a sprint store and get signed up for a sprint account, etc. I'm using it and loving it! no issues with getting a sim card, etc.",5
The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping.,1

The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4
Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don't like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one.,2
excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much.,5
You will not get a 1 yr Apple warranty with this purchase. My phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. I contacted Apple and was told it was already replaced. I contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. Horrible experience. Will never buy from this seller.,1

I just got my phone today and it keeps freezing I have to lock it than unlock it so it will act right ..I'm so upset and I waited for this phone for so long ..just hope I don't have to pay to get another one,1
"I purchased three phones each phone is in good condition, arrival time was great, received current update from apple, so far so good from three teenagers.",5
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition.,3
"Initially had some issues with the phone not being unlocked, seller contacted me and rectified the situation. Phone works great and I am very happy with the product, especially the customer service.",5

"This is my first iphone ever and I'm 100% satisfied. This iPhone 5c came earlier than it was supposed to arrive, looking brand new, unlocked, with 3 chargers, screen cases, headphones (not regular iPhone headphones though). All in all, I'm a happy camper.",5
Nice looking phone as usual buy Apple just screwed me up yet again with the phone memory it said it was 8gb and turned out to be 5.4 to be precise. Why do they keep shoving us up all their stupid apps that No one ever uses,1
"Purchased for my daughter for t mobile prepaid service. Had to purchase a micro sim card from tmobile and phone worked perfectly. Phone did not come in the standard iphone white box I'm used to, but upon opening it phone looked new and had all the plastic coverings a new phone should have.",5
"Got a great price for iphone 5c. Was delivered in two days, brand new as advertised and my daughter loves it. It works great with AT&T and I get to keep the same plan without having to do the AT&T upgrade for my daughter which is even better deal.",5
"Interestingly, the phone actually came with a Verizon simcard though it claims it will not work with Verizon. My from the big apple is model A1532 which is prossibly an verizon unlocked version. I tested it with my H2O prepaid card and it works well though. Hope this help.",4
I'm wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound...,1
Got my phone a little while ago and had a little bit of trouble with getting it over and working on Metro PCS . But I got it and am finally #teamiphone !,5
Really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. I would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. Thanks!,5
Love my phone . It was used but it look brand NEW! The only thing I wasn't impressed with is that she sent me fake iPhone headsets but that's okay. Overall great seller. I recommend this seller. @Sharri International Inc 'i got the green one ',5
"It came very fast, cute phone and of course amazing Apple quality, the only weird thing is that even the phone was new, it came with a sim card inside of the phone...",4
The phone was brand new as advertised but it wasn't factory unlocked. I had to return it. I guess I am gonna stop buying electronic devices through amazon,3
"ordered it and it came on time, nothing wrong with the phone. it only cost $15 for a sim card to activate your phone or switch phones (same carrier). truly decent.((my carrier is t-mobile))",5
I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far. Otherwise its a decent iPhone and arrived on time through Amazon Prime which is a terrific service,3
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4

I was skeptical when I bought this product. It works perfectly. The seller also asked any questions that may arise after purchasing the product. Excellent quality and shipped fast. I highly recommend it,5
I order this phone as a gift for my niece. I was really unsure to get this on Amazon because I never got an iPhone other than the Apple Store but ended up being a good experience. This is my review:1. Works good.2. The outside conditions are 9/10.3. Software ok!4. Fast delivery5. Headphones and charger works perfect,5
"The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there's a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer",2
IPhone 5c is extremely slow on current iOS. If I take about 30 Pictures and couple of videos the storage is full. It was a mistake buying an 8GB phone.,1

This phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn't go through. I can't return because window has been closed. Apple won't replace because I didn't purchase from them. I'm out $300. I recommend you do not buy!,1
"I ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, I got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. I'm thinking about returning it, but I can't go without a phone for long and I'm not sure how long it'll take for them to get me the right one. I'm bummed out.",1
"Not even 4 months into owning this phone has it stopped working, well I have no screen. I am getting texts and calls, I just can't respond to them. Not pleased at all!!!!!!",1
"recieved this phone today, when i started to set it up I couldnt as it told me it had to be activated by a certain icloud account which was not mine!!!!!!!",1
The phone was brand new as advertised but it wasn't factory unlocked. I had to return it. I guess I am gonna stop buying electronic devices through amazon,3
"I'm Having problems receiving calls with this phone...the calls go straight to the voice mail. not every single call though, some friends say that they had to call twice or three times to reach me...I get notifications for missed calls and I can see who called me, but still it's a frustrating problem to have!",1

Got my phone a little while ago and had a little bit of trouble with getting it over and working on Metro PCS . But I got it and am finally #teamiphone !,5
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4
"For the price, this is an excellent entry level iOS phone.Its interesting that this phone is cheaper than a new iPod touch.Sister dropped her 4s in the toilet, this was a great replacement to that.",5
Totally better than I expected it to be. Fully functional with no problems what so ever. There is minimal wear and tear but you can barely see it. Will definitely be ordering from you guys again soon!,5
"This was a nightmare. The phone was not unlocked, and it took me forever to try to activate it. Then I found out it was because the phone was reported as STOLEN. I had to send it back and purchase a different phone. Never again will I buy a phone online",1
"It came in excellent condition, runs very good, only sidenote would be a slight scuff on the Sim card tray but other than that very good phone 10/10 would recommend",4
"Initially had some issues with the phone not being unlocked, seller contacted me and rectified the situation. Phone works great and I am very happy with the product, especially the customer service.",5
The phone looked like it went through a blender. Deep scratches all over the blue part. Turned the phone on and there was nothing but a line down the side of it. Returned for refund.,1
This was an amazing buy. I was very skeptical considering that its risky to buy a used phone.The phone is exactly as it was advertised. Shipped fast.Its been more than 3 months now and never experienced any issues.,5
The phone is beautiful work lovely and no scratches All I have to do is put my Sim card and turn it on and goes work right away I Gave this a five-star cousin I have no problem with it,5
This phone works just fine and as described by the seller. There was not a scratch on it when I received it. I am very satisfied with this phone and would buy from this seller again.,4
"Phone was NOT NEW as described. Phone stopped working after 8 months. When I took it to the Apple store they told me my phone was a ""Franken-Phone"" made up of parts from many old phones. Apple will not repair it and I seriously doubt I will see my money again. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!",1
"Might be unlucky because this phone itself is unfuctional. It doesn't open half the time when I click the power or home button, sometimes I even flick the mute button for it to work but it doesn't. It only opens when I recieve a call",1
Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don't like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one.,2
excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much.,5
You will not get a 1 yr Apple warranty with this purchase. My phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. I contacted Apple and was told it was already replaced. I contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. Horrible experience. Will never buy from this seller.,1
"This phone was a great price, and works as intended. i have always been and android user, this is my first IPhone and it works great. i also love the color.",4
"Awesome!!!It had a couple of scuff marks along the edges but other than that I was very pleasantly surprised. It was very affordable, ecspecially for a 14 year old with a small job...so happy....",5
"i bought this product and i choose the option ''new'' now it results its refubrished. it doesnt have warranty anymore, i bought it 4 months ago. What can i do if a need the warranty now. i need an answer",1
"Purchased this for my mom. She loves it.. came when promised. Arrived in immaculate condition. Flawless.. unlocked as promised, everything works no issues, for $150 best iphone 5 u will get. . Charger included. No complaints",5
Only had fone for about month and it was stolen. I'm out all that money. No one would do anything for me. Even a discount when I'm ready to purchase another fone. I just felt something could of been done that's a lot of money to be out,1
"Scam! When I was buying it, it was a sim card, not iPhone! It costed 1 cent and didn't worked. They did it to get reviewes and now are changing description. What a shame!",1
"I bought Apple I Phone for my mom as a gift, unfortunately it didn't work. I contact seller and I receive refund. I am very happy with customer service. I have never had so nice and understanding service.",4
"Flawless Phone!!! A+++++ besides it being practically new I got it real quick and took 2 minutes to activate with my carrier! Will do business again in a heartbeat! Thanks ""CELLAS""",5

I ended up taking the phone to Walmart and asked them if they could activate it. The employee inserted a new SIM card in it and activated it thru their Straight Talk wireless. When the only carrier in my small town couldn't or either wouldn't do it. Now it works fine! Will not be sending it back after all.,4
"the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used",2
We purchased this item as a gift on Christmas 2014 and this item is still in use. Works like a charm with no problems. Item new in box with all accessories included. Excellent performance quality even in the middle of nowhere. It has been a great phone. We would again purchase the same item from the same seller.,5
I order this phone as a gift for my niece. I was really unsure to get this on Amazon because I never got an iPhone other than the Apple Store but ended up being a good experience. This is my review:1. Works good.2. The outside conditions are 9/10.3. Software ok!4. Fast delivery5. Headphones and charger works perfect,5
"The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there's a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer",2
IPhone 5c is extremely slow on current iOS. If I take about 30 Pictures and couple of videos the storage is full. It was a mistake buying an 8GB phone.,1
"ordered it and it came on time, nothing wrong with the phone. it only cost $15 for a sim card to activate your phone or switch phones (same carrier). truly decent.((my carrier is t-mobile))",5
I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far. Otherwise its a decent iPhone and arrived on time through Amazon Prime which is a terrific service,3
"In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You'd never know this phone wasn't brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!!",5
"The seller is very trustworthy, I received the phone safe and sound with no issues on it except that whenever there's pressure on a certain area of the phone screen the screen will kind of go in and out. Very minor detail and doesn't affect phone at all, it just shows that the phone has had its screen replaced before selling.",4
"I want to know how to have a feedback or return a product that went wrong , buy a iPhone 5c and the start button and a front camera that I do not work",2
"This has been a great cell phone. Price was reasonable and since it was unlocked, was simple to set up service with our carrier. Love the look of the phone (blue) and a good size to fit in pocket, purse, etc.",5
"Arrived in perfect condition; no problem setting up and works like it's brand new. Buying a used phone can be a scary proposition, but this seller is honest/safe.",5
I was so skeptical to buy a used phone off here BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! Not a scratch on it and works perfect! Don't buy from anyone else saved so much money and I'm very satisfied,5
"I got this phone day before yesterday. Arrived on time. The phone was sealed and is brand new. Loved it. I bought it for my mother in India. So, I will have to take it to India and check if it works with the service providers there. It should, hopefully. :)",5
Thank goodness the phone worked. However the earphones were not the original apple earphones; they looked very cheap and you can tell they aren't from apple.,2
"This is my first iphone ever and I'm 100% satisfied. This iPhone 5c came earlier than it was supposed to arrive, looking brand new, unlocked, with 3 chargers, screen cases, headphones (not regular iPhone headphones though). All in all, I'm a happy camper.",5
Nice looking phone as usual buy Apple just screwed me up yet again with the phone memory it said it was 8gb and turned out to be 5.4 to be precise. Why do they keep shoving us up all their stupid apps that No one ever uses,1
"The screen had a sort of smudge in the center. We bought the telephone for testing, so we can live with that. But is a defect that wasn't advertised and in my opinion that's not ""very good"" quality.",2
"Do not buy this phone. It is USELESS I REPEAT IT IS USELESS. The screen does not work. These people sell BASURAR on amazon. I don't know y amazon grants them the permission to sell cheap, useless and garbage product on their site.",1
Phone was listed as like new but when we tried to activate it the camera didn't work and you could make a call but the person you were calling couldn't hear you,1
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use.,5
My phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. Not to mention 2 of my letters won't work when I'm typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself,2
Leary at first puchasing a used phone however couldn't be happier. Looks almost brand new and no problems at all with use. Will start with a used phone from this seller next time shopping for a phone.,5
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition.,3
"This product came earlier than the expected date. Mines were as cheap as 85 dollars , the only difficult is that i needed a sim card to activate my Phone luckily my cousin was there to let me borrow hers . phone came perfectly no scratches or nothing , a charger came with it so i recommend any body to purchase from this seller",5
I was worried at first considering the low price but I'm very happy with the my 5c it had very very small scratches and I was able to put an ATT sim in before switching to cricket wireless.no problems.5 stars all day.,5
"Sold as new, but I don't think it was. The key to open the sim card slot was missing and there was already a sim card in the phone. Otherwise, all is working well.",2
"The phone arrived extremely fast in just 2 business days, which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected, almost new. It runs great. It arrived with everything the seller said it would in the listing. This was a great buy. I am extremely happy.",5
"Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.",2
"8GB iPhone is USELESS. iOS takes up nearly /2 the storage -- the device is maxed out after few pictures, songs and chats. DON'T BUY AN 8GB IPHONE!!! Expensive lesson learned.",1
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I was so worried that it would not be what we expected it to be per online pics, but it was! My 2nd worry was whether or not I could get it activated with Metro PCS and of course I was! MY DAUGHTER HAS NO COMPLAINTS>>What u see is what you get! Love It!",5
Great phone! Down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. Learned this the hard way. I'm an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. Spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must.,5
I personally prefer the androids but my daughter loved this phone! It was everything she wanted and I got it at a really good price! It does what she needs and all the extras that she wants. We are happy!,5
"The phone works great!!! Although, a few days after I received the phone, the charger that came with it stopped working. I was sent a new charger and it charges my phone very slowly. I let them know again and they are sending me another charger. They help solve their customers problems and I highly recommend you buy their products. HAPPY BUYING (:",5
"Perfect all the way around but if you are a big music fan I recommend getting the one with moré storage, this iPhone has 13 apps and I can only fit about 80 songs",5
"This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed",3
I got my phone yesterday it looked brand new my Sims card counldnt fit in it so I took it to the store got exchange for a pink one but overall the phone look brand new no scratches,3
I was skeptical when I bought this product. It works perfectly. The seller also asked any questions that may arise after purchasing the product. Excellent quality and shipped fast. I highly recommend it,5
"Purchased for my daughter for t mobile prepaid service. Had to purchase a micro sim card from tmobile and phone worked perfectly. Phone did not come in the standard iphone white box I'm used to, but upon opening it phone looked new and had all the plastic coverings a new phone should have.",5
"Got a great price for iphone 5c. Was delivered in two days, brand new as advertised and my daughter loves it. It works great with AT&T and I get to keep the same plan without having to do the AT&T upgrade for my daughter which is even better deal.",5
"Interestingly, the phone actually came with a Verizon simcard though it claims it will not work with Verizon. My from the big apple is model A1532 which is prossibly an verizon unlocked version. I tested it with my H2O prepaid card and it works well though. Hope this help.",4
I purchased 2 of these phones in early Dec 2016. Both phones could not be activated by Verizon. Wasted a lot of my time with Verizona customer support. Very angry.,1
"Perfect size for ease of use, easy to drop the phone with big screen. I thought the plastic material on the back can cause scratch easily, it's actually very not the case.",5
"recieved this phone today, when i started to set it up I couldnt as it told me it had to be activated by a certain icloud account which was not mine!!!!!!!",1
I like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top. Also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that. I can say other than that it is a good phone.,3
Great iPhone 5C for a used one! Has a few miner scratches but if it wasn't cause of that would off gave it 5 stars. Other than that no complaints works well.,4
The phone I received was defective. The home button does not work. It did arrive a day earlier than expected. Phone powers on and all but cannot exit any app. Cannot return to home screen. Phone is useless. I have to power it off then back on again to get to home screen.,1
"No problem getting this phone turn on by metro pcs. Works great and my daughter loved it for her birthday. Also, came in the date I was suppose to receive it by.",5
"the phone arrived as described in great condition. it was ready to go to a sprint store and get signed up for a sprint account, etc. I'm using it and loving it! no issues with getting a sim card, etc.",5
The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping.,1
"The phone powered on once, shut off and did not turn back on. The time it did come on, I got a ""white screen of death"" and had to manually restart it. This was incredibly frustrating and irritating.",1
Really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. I would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. Thanks!,5
Love my phone . It was used but it look brand NEW! The only thing I wasn't impressed with is that she sent me fake iPhone headsets but that's okay. Overall great seller. I recommend this seller. @Sharri International Inc 'i got the green one ',5
"It came very fast, cute phone and of course amazing Apple quality, the only weird thing is that even the phone was new, it came with a sim card inside of the phone...",4
"bought this as a gift for my mom's bday, she absolutely adores it, much better than her previous iphone 4, fast and sleek, standard apple product, i might get the pink for myself, shipped super quick, will do business again",4
"This was the best buy for my situation, did not want to give my current phone carrier. They were able to activate this iphone with no problems. thank you.",5
"Got it in great shape. Love it. A faulty charger cable caused a bit of a scare, but otherwise, got a quality product for a decent price. Very satisfied.",4
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4
I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it,1
"in the description it said it was unlocked but the sim card was locked to att, I had to go to a lot of trouble just to try and unlock the from from att, I had to go in the store presonnally and it took forever. but the phone it self is good.",3
I just got my phone today and it keeps freezing I have to lock it than unlock it so it will act right ..I'm so upset and I waited for this phone for so long ..just hope I don't have to pay to get another one,1
"I purchased three phones each phone is in good condition, arrival time was great, received current update from apple, so far so good from three teenagers.",5
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5
Just received my iPhone 5c used but like brand new:) working so far perfectly on WiFi only.. Will hook up with AT&T Monday.. From HandHeld Heroes as promised.. With charger.. Will be doing business with them again.. Can't say enough nice stuff about them!,5
"Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful.",1
I bought this phone for my husband for his birthday. He was still using his original flip phone from 2006 prior to this. He is so glad that I got this phone. He doesn't know why he didn't change to this sooner. He found it easy to use.,5
"Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast.",5
"Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract.",3
Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs.,5
"when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good.",1
"The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it.",2
at this time the phone works fine. The cables were not a Apple approved charging cable and they were disabled by Itunes. Had to spend more money on a cable,3
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
"This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!!",5
"Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price.",4
"Great deal for an iPhone! We use it for our tween (and as backup for Waze and other apps) as an AT&T GoPhone. Since the case is less robust than the other iPhones, we got an Otterbox case and so far it's been working great!",5
"When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone.",1
I was happy I got a case and a charger that was in the description but I was told the phone works perfectly fine but it doesn't. The phone twitches which is beyond annoying. I don't appreciate that,1
"I was nervous about getting a used phone,but so far I have not had any problems .It works and functions every bit as good as the new iPhone I had before someone stole in hospital lobby as I was charging it!..My contract wasn't up and I couldn't afford the 500~600 for another one!",5
I ordered my phone Tuesday night at almost midnight and received it today even though shipping said May 17- June 2. I use AT&T go phone and all I had to do was go into my local store for a sim card and they set it up! So pleased with this purchase,5
I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster.,1
"Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the ""best"" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both.",5
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new .,2
"I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline.",1
I had the phone for about two months and all of a sudden it starts shutting off on me and won't stay on contacted the seller and got no response. Horrible service and looks like it was put together like crap,1
The screen was popped out. It had scratches on the back. Didn't match description. I dropped it on a soft surface and my screen was jacked. I had to pay to get it fixed.,1
Received my phone faster than expected. Just what I wanted. The phone has been working just fine. The price was right and I have enjoyed using the phone.,4
Love the phone got here on time....At first i had read it would have a few scratches but you cant even tell. Thank you love the phone...plus any questions i had they would right away answer them....,5
"Great phone for my daughter. She still has it. Was practically new when I received it. Seller was wonderful and very helpful with some of the technical issues we had, not with the phone. Would highly recommend him.",5
"The phone arrived and the touch on the screen is messed up. :( It works okay sometimes but most of the time if I touch something, it reads like I touched another part of the screen and something else opens instead. Very frustrating.",1
"it has a glitch that drops wifi, and you can't simply turn it back on. shut it off, then reboot, and wifi capability returns. otherwise, it's been a good phone. it's used, after all. even a new one can have a glitch, over time.",4
"The phone was on time and no cracks, but minor wear. However, after a week it blanked out and gave me issues, it does this once every few weeks.But other than that, I do enjoy my phone.",4
"Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a ""new"" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work.",1
"The iPhone heats up & battery dies too fast & I only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don't seem like it. From internal conditions. looks great, don't work great:(",2
"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
"I have had phone for a short time and the top of the screen started to crack without me going anything. I thought I was purchasing a quality product, but I was mistaken. I have been an Amazon prime shopper for a long time and this has been my worst purchase.",1
"Brought for my Grandaughter and she loves it, still working strong.....now she want the one that works underwater, so then this phone will soon be mine....I guess I need to get updated shortly from my good ole Pantech Matrix flip phone with keypad....",5
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,2
Cell phone works as expected. So far no problems with the cell phone.Had a little trouble with the charger but had no problems at all getting a replacement. Customer service was great. Will differently buy again in the future.,5
"I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating.",2
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"The delivery was fast, the phone is in good shape for the most part. The earphone port is broken though. My earphones can't go all the way in which is upsetting because I am that person that uses my earphones nonstop!",2
The phone arrived earlier than anticipated and it is absolutely as good as new. I am very pleased and will definitely work with this seller when my husband purchases a new phone in a few months. No complaints at all!,5
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought.,1
"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap.",1
"I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested!",1
The phone was a gift to my grandson to replace his broken phone. It was just as described and was easy to set up. Everything migrated over very easily and completely. Phone was in very good condition,5
I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new! Also love the case but I do use other ones. In the pics I have a sticker button and a screen protector so I can't show you the screen,5
"Got this from Doc and Roc Overstock through Amazon as a replacement for my wife's phone. Seller was awesome and super fast, device works wonderfully. No complaints, everything working perfectly.",5
The iPhone itself works like a charm! I was very pleased with my purchase. However the charger that came with the iPhone was very short and charged the phone really slow which wasn't too big of a problem being that you can get another charger for a small price. Overall I love the iPhone. Thanks!,5
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it,1
"The description said it was in 'very good' condition, but when I actually received the phone it was in perfect condition. No nicks or scratches period. Definitely recommend.",5
Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together!,2
"This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no?",4
The 5c is an awesome device. This device doesn't just come in black or white like all of the other iPhones. The plastic build is also good quality and feels durable.,5
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see.,4
"The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too!",4
Purchases a used iPhone and that's what it got. Looks used with scratches on screen. I put an Otter box on it for protection but it also works to cover used look. Phone works great. Good phone for kids.,4
"The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back.",2
"Phone was in decent physical shape but the battery sucks. When I went to replace it someone had glued the battery in, some the screws were missing to the circuit boards. Now the phone freezes and restarts very often.",1
"Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody!",5
"For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it.",5
The phone came within a week. The phone fit the description and it was unlocked for me to use. Phone was in great condition and will definitely order again.,5
"I got this few days before Christmas and it came it right in time. The phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. My daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. So far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there's any concern on the phone, hopefully not.",5
"The phone is new. Everything is included in the package. However, the ICCID of the SIM was identified by AT&T as permanently disabled. So instead of being able to activate it online, I'm going to have to the nearest AT&T store an hour away.5 stars for the phone itself. 3 starts for the BS SIM card.",3
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy,1
"It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again",5
"The phone was in the condition as advertised which was ""fair"". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen",3
Absolutely Awful This seller sold me a lost or stolen phone that has a block on it. The phone appearance was great however I could not get it activated because there was a system block on the phone.beyond angry! 0stars!!!,1
"I'm not a fan of Apple anymore, I had gotten it to do Face Time with my little cousin but I was under the assumption it was an AT&T Phone I could use on Straight Talk but turned out it was a Sprint phone. If you like iPhones it's nice but I found it too small as well",1
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage. It's simple but effective. The seller didn't fail to give good service. The iPhone 's legit and I love it!",5
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol.,1
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5
Just received my iPhone 5c used but like brand new:) working so far perfectly on WiFi only.. Will hook up with AT&T Monday.. From HandHeld Heroes as promised.. With charger.. Will be doing business with them again.. Can't say enough nice stuff about them!,5
"Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful.",1
"The phone I received was defective. The wifi function of the phone did not work. Thankfully, I had full insurance on my broken iphone that I was attempting to replace. Verizon covered the cost of this phone and provided me with a new one. Never again will I purchase a refurbished phone through Amazon.",1
"I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the ""P"" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT.",4
My son is disatisfied with his phone. It does not consistently work. He isn't able to text or answer calls part of the time. Not sure if it just needs a new screen.,1
"This phone was labeled to be in ""good condition"" instead of excellent or like new- it seemed brand new! No scratches or anything. Very pleased with this purchase.",5
"The speaker did not work. I had to trade it to Verizon for $43 because my 11 year old son had been waiting to activate it. We took it in to activate it and it didn't work so I had to buy one at Verizon so as not to disappoint my son on his birthday, He brought his grades up to earn it. I was out $60 and got a phone contract I did not want.",1
"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money.",1
Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store,5
It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page.,2
"Came in great condition. No SIM included and the information booklet was missing, as well as a few dints. However this was as expected so overall I am stoked!",4
Bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and the phone will not hold a charge. Have to take it to an Apple store to have it repaired. Very unhappy about this.,1
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
"Shipping took a bit, but the phone is in excellent condition and has made my life extremely easier. Bbrewer2 was very polite and got back to me quickly.",5
Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone.,1
The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone.,3
"Phone was glitchy, screen becomes unresponsive in the middle and you can only touch the top and bottom of it until you turn it off and turn it back on. Happens at least 20x a day if you open your phone 30x",1
"The phone arrived promptly as it was a Christmas present. However, the screen began to lift two days after Christmas and the phone froze up. Returned the item on January 6, 2015 and waiting patiently for a return.",2
Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever.,5
Cosmetically it matched the description. It took 2 hours to get the phone activated at the Verizon store. I was worried it was not going to work. The phone keeps freezing and I have to keep resetting it to get text messages.,2
Have had the phone a couple months. Daughter dropped it on a carpeted floor from only about 3 ft away - cracked the screen. I doubt we'll be replacing it with another i5 as we hear that is a problem with them.,3
"Awesome first phone for my 9 yr old. Not too $$$ that if he loses it or breaks it, it will break my bank and the ease of iOS for him is good. Pretty study as well for his needs. Battery life is really good on these.",5
"Exactly what I was looking for! My daughter wanted an iPhone for her birthday and I didn't want to spend a fortune and this was just what I wanted! The condition was nearly perfect, it came quickly and it was exactly as promised!",5
"Just as described. Due to my mistake, I had to send it back. I ordered the Iphone 6. Best value I could find. Great customer support. Wonderful to work with.",5
"DO NOT BUY. When i purchased this phone it was sold to me as a NEW phone, not refurbished. It is clear now that the phone WAS refurbished and the battery only lasted a few month.",1
"After reviewing the phone and trying everything ywsteady to switch over to this phone it would not work. I ordered a new sim as well. Long story short, boh were a waste of my time and money and the phone did not come with a charger. The phone itself is in great condition, but was a waste for me.",1
"Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless.",5
LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :),5
"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone.",4
"The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition. When I received it there were scratches on it, the screen pops up in one corner, and all the accessories were fake with a mispelled word on it. I was very disappointed with this product.",2
"I purchased this phone from cellcow through Amazon. The phone was a piece of junk. It acts possessed, randomly switching screens and typing without my even touching it. Save your money!",1
"When I received it, it didn't come with SIM card and the speaker in the phone didn't work, so I couldn't hear anything. It also wouldn't make a call. The phone looked in new condition, but unfortunately didn't work. But I returned it with no questions asked and the process was very easy.",1
This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day!,5
This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time.,1
"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile.",5
This phone is stuck in the year 1970 and when I try to change the year it just keeps skipping over all of them.. and then the screen wouldn't work when I plugged it in with the charger.. really hope this can be a quick fix otherwise I'll be very disappointed...waste of my money I guess.,3
"Perfect condition. Barely looks touched. No scrapes, scratches or Knicks. It came completely cleaned out and ready for me to use. Charges super fast. No technical issues",5
"I usually don't complain if something isn't too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. The back is also badly scrapped up! It didn't even come with a charger!",1
nice price for phone but the motherboard of the phone sticks and i cant text or do anything with the phone. i thought i wait it out to see what else can be done for the phone nothing,1
"Great phone replacement for our other phone. Shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren't as many defects on the phone as described. It was better.",5
"Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months...",2
Honestly freaked me out a little because it did not come with a sim card but I should'nt have expected that anyways. The seller gave nice institutions on what to do about getting a sim card and activating the phone. My phone is now activated and i am very happy!,5
works great! was able to take it to veroson and have it activated. Daughter loves it as a replacement for her phone that was stolen. Company answered questions and we received it on time.,5
"Ad stated in mint condition except minor damage on the corner. That was accurate, however, a few of the keys don't work and this was a graduation gift for my son. Very disappointed.",3
Received as advertised: Verizon Wireless Apple iPhone 5c. Took it to the Verizon store and had them insert a SIM card and it works great. No complaints.,5
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
"There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up.",4
"iphone came in original Apple packaging and in only two days with standard shipping. Works with Verizon just like the ad says. New condition, no scuffs or anything. Thanks!",5
"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price.",5
"After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone.",1
"The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase.",3
These things are extremely brittle. If you were to purchase one I would highly suggest investing in a heavy duty case. I literally have gone through 4 in the last year and I treat it very carefully.Otherwise a nice piece of technology.,3
The iPhone 5c I received is great. The charger and USB cable that came with it have issues. By trial and error I determined the charger barely works. The USB cable has a very small break in it at the edge where it connects with the phone port. It's a disappointment that I have to replace these items immediately.,4
"This phone was NOT compatible with the Verizon network. I had to get a new phone and pay just as much for it. TERRIBLE marketing, don't believe it when it says it is verizon compatible.",1
"Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great!",4
"I received the phone on time. The phone works really good, but there is a scratch on the back but its not really a big deal for me. I would recommend this phone and the apple outlet store. 100% satisfied on this phone.",4
"Great price for working product in good condition. They did leave out the fact that you need to buy new sim card with this phone, which may have been common sense but it still would have been nice to know. The charger cord that came with it also quit working within a couple of days.",4
"The phones screen broke right away, and just keeps cracking. The refurbisher did not do a good job. Plus the battery dies constantly. Hope others take the time to provide feedback so the rip off doesn't continue.",1
"I'm extremely happy with my purchase. It was a present for my son. The price was great. The pictures weren't entirely accurate. My experience is that the phone that arrived was in much better condition than the one in the pic. I called and asked them to ship it earlier, which they did.",5
"I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great!",5
"This works great! Exactly as described, like-new in case with all accessories and even included a Verizon sim-card. Activated quickly with no problems. I've now had for about 2 months and it works like a charm!",5
Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone.,1
The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone.,3
"The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all..",2
It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out.

Verizon covered the cost of this phone and provided me with a new one. Never again will I purchase a refurbished phone through Amazon.",1
Very satisfied with the quality. This was the first time I'd bought a used phone and I'm very satisfied. The return policy and pictures made me feel better about ordering and I'm likely to do this again in the future.,5
"The speaker did not work. I had to trade it to Verizon for $43 because my 11 year old son had been waiting to activate it. We took it in to activate it and it didn't work so I had to buy one at Verizon so as not to disappoint my son on his birthday, He brought his grades up to earn it. I was out $60 and got a phone contract I did not want.",1
"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star.",4
"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!",4
"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it.",1
"Shipping took a bit, but the phone is in excellent condition and has made my life extremely easier. Bbrewer2 was very polite and got back to me quickly.",5

"Had a hard time getting activated from Sprint and when activated the ear piece didn't work, had to return to Apple and get a another one and that had the same problem , and back to the Apple store again .",2
"When I bought it the advertisement said... unlocked. Its not true... I tried cancel it, but it was not possible. I need to send back, it's big hard time for me... I lived in Brazil....",1
Great phone! I really thought there would a lot pf scratches on it but there was totally nothing it is like brand new the only complaint i have was that the charger was broken but is ok i bought one and it works perfectly fine thank you for the phone,5
"i absolutely love this product, it was everything the description said. there are a few minor scratches but its barely noticeable, phone works great; it included the charger and headphones. it was sold by the warehouse deals, inc",5
I received the phone quickly but am disappointed to say that the headphone /auxiliary cord plug in does not work. One reeson for wanting the iPhone was for music. Paid a decent price for a manufacturer refurbished phone and it does not completely work,3
Came in. Early but terrible! Would't get it unless you can work it properly. It didn't even come with a charger. When said it would be provided. Also it doesn't read my SIM card and won't let you use it like a regular phone. A SIM card is needed to get pass set up.,1
It was shipped on time and was exactly as advertised. In very good condition with only 1 small scratch on the front. Our daughter was thrilled with her Christmas present.,5
I am not the owner of it but I suspect everything is good. It was a gift for a lost soul.Delivery was as stated and on time as promised.Thank you guys so much and have a blessed 2015.Arnold Collins,5
"Phone Came On Time ! i was very excited and it came just How it was described , ( no charger , and unlocked , 16GB , ect ) it does Have very light scratches on the back But a good Ole case Will take care of that !!!!!!!! the screen is perfectly clear , phone works just as new , Thank Youu!",4
"Love the phone.The only problem was finding a sprint store for the Sim card, but finally found one.Phone is working very good.No problems so far.Came with head phones and phone charger.The phone was New.",4
"I'm an Android person, got an I-phone 4 and HATED it, decided I'd be an Android person forever, but then I thought I'd try this and I really like it. With all the changes and updates it does most of the Android stuff, easier to clean up memory, the only thing it's missing is Swype.",5
It is less expensive than the iphone 5s and I bought it with no contract to replace the iphone 4s that she had. She loves it and I think the phone looks nice and sleek.,5
There was an issue with the ESN number of this phone. We were unable to use the phone.The seller was easy to work with to give me a quick refund. We still have no phone unfortunatly.,1
"Exactly what I wanted! Phone is in great condition.. Only problem was the SIM card was reported lost or stolen, so had to go to the sprint store and get a new one..",4
"Product I returned it , it was locked because it was reported stolen. Sprint the informed me the device will not work because it's looked because it's stolen item.",1
"Great phone, great service despite not reading the fine print that it doesn't come with a SIM card. Easy fix from my phone carrier and after a friendly email exchange from the shipping carrier all was taken care of.",5
"Perfect phone! Only down fall was that I wasn't aware you had to go to sprint to get a SIM card, so that was awkward Christmas morning! But overall great experience.",4
"Not pleased with it , tried to get it connected with sprint. But sprint came back saying the serial number was bad and that it was clearly not a sprint phone . Like the seller clearly states in the title",1
"Couldn't even activated it when it came in . Had to get sprint to do some extra stuff with it , my service still blinks out sometimes like I don't have a SIM card in it",2
I was unable to get the phone activated because I have a T-Mobile phone!! I couldn't get anyone to unlock the phone so I could get the SIMS card that I had to buy to work. The package it came in was also cracked on the edge...,2
"For the most part the phone works well. However, it does not work as well as the description says. Phone shuts down and shows low battery icon whenever the camera is opened or flash is used. The power cord that came with the home did not work. Overall, it meets every expectation you think of when you order a cell phone online for $100.",3
"2nd try at buying a phone and having it activated on my sprint account. Don't know if its the phones or sprint just sucks. Probably the latter, but I'm done with the trying to save money by buying a used phone.",1
"I received this phone on 04th of March, now the phone don't work well and the clock doesn't work anymore, in addition at the apple store told me that the phone is not new but born on 2014, the supplier, the supplier don' t help me well.",1
When I got to the inside of the memory of the phone found out it was from Mexico... I guess peso for dollar i got the right trade for the phone. It works great no issues been able to converge all the files I desire and the call capability is exactly whAt I needed,4
"I have been using the phone for around three weeks with no complaint so far. Exactly as described, functioned with Sprint as advertised, nothing hidden",5
Phone works perfectly!! Activated with no issues. Description was on point. Screen was fine with minor minor minor scratches. No nicks or chips anywhere. VERY SATISFIED with this purchase. And I got it in a timely fashion without expedited shipping. Definitely would recommend to anyone!!!,5
"I switched to Sprint and got an HTC One, It is a good phone but before that I had an iPhone 4s, couldn't live without an iPhone i guess! very happy with my switch back to an iPhone!Shipping was fast!",5
"My son words, I wish it wasn't activated!! so Mom had to return it.. Very good condition and for the price of phone was reasonable He was very Disappointed...",3
Phone is great no problems with that. Sims card is the problem and sprint is the biggest problem on getting one. Not the phone guys problem but sprint is just a pain to deal with period. finally after 2 weeks of fighting with sprint they are sending me a new sims card.,3
After the first phone we ordered was unable to activate because the serial number was reported Lost/Stolen. The replacement phone the glass was not even fils with the phone indicating that it was refurbished.,1
"very pleased with this purchase. I was skeptical buying a previously owned iphone but just couldnt see paying full price for a brand new one since we werent eligible for an upgrade yet. It was a gift for my daughter for christmas. It was in such good shape with the box and all, she had no idea it was previously owned.",5
I liked the phone but unfortunately I had to ship it back due to me not being able to switch to Sprint service. Everything else about the phone is great including the appearance and performance of the phone.,4
I am having the hardest time getting a SIM card. Apple said they can't give me one. All the sprint stores around me are out but I finally found a sprint store that would give me a free SIM card if I activated my phone there. So I did. And I love my new phone. (:,5
Very disappointed the iphone 5c eye received already been activatied and has an outstanding bill So Not Happy it was 4 my daughters 16th b-day she is so sad,1
Quick and easy! Got it fast and activated it without a problem. I liked it so much I bought another for my wife from this company. I highly recommend them.,5
I bought this I-Phone for my dtr. but I had to return it because it couldn't be unlocked for any other network. phone is beautiful blue. great phone but we just didn't want to be on phone plan,3
"So far so good..... Ordered it Feb 6, 2015 & rcvd it Feb 10, 2015. No problem getting a sim card & having the phone activated. Really no signs of a used phone that i can see. Great seller!",4
Incredibly disappointed and angry. Bought phone for son (his first) who was very excited to get. Took to Sprint store to get added to plan only to find out phone is reported as stolen. In process of return which I hope goes better than the purchase itself. Yet to be determined.,1
"Product as described, fast shipping. We struggled to get it working and ended up at the Sprint store. Could have been ""user error"". Other than that, no hiccups or issues. Have had the phone for 2 weeks, so far so good.",5
"Phone came in Like New condition as advertised; this includes the condition of the earbuds and charger as well. No trouble activating the device, just had to get a new SIM card from my carrier.Overall, very satisfied with the condition and performance of this device. Great experience and shipping was extremely fast.",5
The add said very good condition not even close the back has obvious signs it has taken at least 2 drops and the screen looks like someone cleaned it with steel wool,1
Really fast shipping and is great quality and all I had to do was make an appointment with apple and they gave me a free SIM card then the phone was turned on,5
"The iPhone is great, it's the connection to sprint that is terrible. I can't believe they won't unlock their phones. I would encourage anyone to stay away from a phone connected to sprint.",1
Very upset with this purchase. Phone cane with a simcard already active on another account. Took 3 weeks for my carrier to get me a fresh one. Bad experience,1
"Was not a sprint phone like it claims in the title. The sprint store also claims that its refurbished, which is not indicated anywhere in the discription. Very disappointed.",1
"When I got the phone it was in perfect condition. Then when I went to go activate it, it turned it that it had a previous owner with a outstanding balance with sprint so I could not use it. Very disappointed.",1
"We paid the ""new"" price for this phone, but the one that arrived was used. When we went to activate with Sprint, we were told that the prior owner left a balance owing and that we had to pay that in order to activate the phone. I am trying to return phone now.",1
Better than I ever expected! Brand new Sprint iPhone still in the package. I broke my 5c and Sprint wanted to charge me $600 for a new phone. I saved myself a bundle finding this gem. They swapped my SIM card and activated this awesome phone.,5
The phone was like new. Only needed a sims card which I got for free from the Apple store and had it installed at the Sprint store. It's working out great!,5
"The flash/light does not work, which could really be useful at some times. Also, when I tried activating the phone it shows up as being BLUE cell instead of GREEN with my cellular service. Everything else works pretty well.",3
"The phone was labeled on Amazon as ""new"", but when I went to get it set up, they told me this phone has a contract on it with another carrier and can't be set up till the contract is paid off. Not very happy with ""ChubbiesTech"". The phone guy chuckled when I told him we got it from ChubbiesTech because he said it happens a lot with their phones.",1
"I went to sprint service for TWO HOURS so I can activate it and they can't do it because this phone is not for sprint, if I were you I wouldn't buy this phone just save up your money",1
The item arrived in a timely manner. It was exactly as advertised and contained all the bells and whistles that I expected.. I could not be more pleased.,5
"ugh I asked for the pink and a green one came, also it came cracked with no charger, no headphones not even a box! im super pissed that I wasted my money on that.",1
Phone works great! Had a few problems with the battery and audio but vendor helped me resolve these issues. Phone was in great conditions like stated. this is a great deal.,5
"Do not buy, could not activate iPhone due to it still being linked to another account that was not paid up to date..sending back immediately..waste of time and money",1
I took it to the sprint store to get a sim card. told me it's not on their network. Now im stuck.. I have sprint. You lied to me. They don't even know which network it's apart of so i can't do anything.,1
Just as described. I contacted seller for a faster shipping option as I was without a phone and he hooked me up. I received it within days! It also came with the SIM card so all I had to do was contact Sprint to activate and I was in business!This is my first iPhone so I am still learning all of it's functions.,5
well i don't have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star,3
"The phone seems to be decent, but I can't be sure. The listing says it is unlocked, and can be used on Verizon Wireless 4G LTE plans, but when I tried to activate it with the carrier, I was told it cannot be used with them. This was supposed to be my son's 13th birthday gift, now I have to make other plans.",2
I ordered this to replace a previous phone I bought on Amazon that simply stopped working after 1 week. So far this iPhone seems to be working well and I have had no problems. The battery isn't that great but thats to be expected with an older phone.,4
"This phone lasted me 4 good years. Worked very well. I upgraded to a 7 last week & honestly its just like it. Only difference is that the screen on the 7 is bigger. Didn't see much difference in camera. If you like small phones or are scared about dropping a big phone then this phone is just for you. Gets the job of being a phone, done.",5
Cosmetically it matched the description. It took 2 hours to get the phone activated at the Verizon store. I was worried it was not going to work. The phone keeps freezing and I have to keep resetting it to get text messages.,2
Have had the phone a couple months. Daughter dropped it on a carpeted floor from only about 3 ft away - cracked the screen. I doubt we'll be replacing it with another i5 as we hear that is a problem with them.,3
Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever.,5
"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star.",4
"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!",4
"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it.",1
"Shipping took a bit, but the phone is in excellent condition and has made my life extremely easier. Bbrewer2 was very polite and got back to me quickly.",5
Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone.,1
The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone.,3
"Awesome first phone for my 9 yr old. Not too $$$ that if he loses it or breaks it, it will break my bank and the ease of iOS for him is good. Pretty study as well for his needs. Battery life is really good on these.",5
"Exactly what I was looking for! My daughter wanted an iPhone for her birthday and I didn't want to spend a fortune and this was just what I wanted! The condition was nearly perfect, it came quickly and it was exactly as promised!",5
"Just as described. Due to my mistake, I had to send it back. I ordered the Iphone 6. Best value I could find. Great customer support. Wonderful to work with.",5
"DO NOT BUY. When i purchased this phone it was sold to me as a NEW phone, not refurbished. It is clear now that the phone WAS refurbished and the battery only lasted a few month.",1
"Phone was glitchy, screen becomes unresponsive in the middle and you can only touch the top and bottom of it until you turn it off and turn it back on. Happens at least 20x a day if you open your phone 30x",1
"The phone arrived promptly as it was a Christmas present. However, the screen began to lift two days after Christmas and the phone froze up. Returned the item on January 6, 2015 and waiting patiently for a return.",2
"The speaker did not work. I had to trade it to Verizon for $43 because my 11 year old son had been waiting to activate it. We took it in to activate it and it didn't work so I had to buy one at Verizon so as not to disappoint my son on his birthday, He brought his grades up to earn it. I was out $60 and got a phone contract I did not want.",1
"Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great!",4
This phone is stuck in the year 1970 and when I try to change the year it just keeps skipping over all of them.. and then the screen wouldn't work when I plugged it in with the charger.. really hope this can be a quick fix otherwise I'll be very disappointed...waste of my money I guess.,3
"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price.",5
"After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone.",1
"Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless.",5
LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :),5
"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone.",4
"I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great!",5
"This works great! Exactly as described, like-new in case with all accessories and even included a Verizon sim-card. Activated quickly with no problems. I've now had for about 2 months and it works like a charm!",5
My son is disatisfied with his phone. It does not consistently work. He isn't able to text or answer calls part of the time. Not sure if it just needs a new screen.,1
"This phone was labeled to be in ""good condition"" instead of excellent or like new- it seemed brand new! No scratches or anything. Very pleased with this purchase.",5
These things are extremely brittle. If you were to purchase one I would highly suggest investing in a heavy duty case. I literally have gone through 4 in the last year and I treat it very carefully.Otherwise a nice piece of technology.,3
The iPhone 5c I received is great. The charger and USB cable that came with it have issues. By trial and error I determined the charger barely works. The USB cable has a very small break in it at the edge where it connects with the phone port. It's a disappointment that I have to replace these items immediately.,4
"This phone was NOT compatible with the Verizon network. I had to get a new phone and pay just as much for it. TERRIBLE marketing, don't believe it when it says it is verizon compatible.",1
Bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and the phone will not hold a charge. Have to take it to an Apple store to have it repaired. Very unhappy about this.,1
works great! was able to take it to veroson and have it activated. Daughter loves it as a replacement for her phone that was stolen. Company answered questions and we received it on time.,5
"Ad stated in mint condition except minor damage on the corner. That was accurate, however, a few of the keys don't work and this was a graduation gift for my son. Very disappointed.",3
"I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the ""P"" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT.",4
"Great phone replacement for our other phone. Shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren't as many defects on the phone as described. It was better.",5
"Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months...",2
Honestly freaked me out a little because it did not come with a sim card but I should'nt have expected that anyways. The seller gave nice institutions on what to do about getting a sim card and activating the phone. My phone is now activated and i am very happy!,5
"There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up.",4
"iphone came in original Apple packaging and in only two days with standard shipping. Works with Verizon just like the ad says. New condition, no scuffs or anything. Thanks!",5
"The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition. When I received it there were scratches on it, the screen pops up in one corner, and all the accessories were fake with a mispelled word on it. I was very disappointed with this product.",2
"I received the phone on time. The phone works really good, but there is a scratch on the back but its not really a big deal for me. I would recommend this phone and the apple outlet store. 100% satisfied on this phone.",4
"Great price for working product in good condition. They did leave out the fact that you need to buy new sim card with this phone, which may have been common sense but it still would have been nice to know. The charger cord that came with it also quit working within a couple of days.",4
"The phones screen broke right away, and just keeps cracking. The refurbisher did not do a good job. Plus the battery dies constantly. Hope others take the time to provide feedback so the rip off doesn't continue.",1
"I'm extremely happy with my purchase. It was a present for my son. The price was great. The pictures weren't entirely accurate. My experience is that the phone that arrived was in much better condition than the one in the pic. I called and asked them to ship it earlier, which they did.",5
It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page.,2
"Came in great condition. No SIM included and the information booklet was missing, as well as a few dints. However this was as expected so overall I am stoked!",4
"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile.",5
This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day!,5
This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time.,1
"The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all..",2
"I purchased this phone from cellcow through Amazon. The phone was a piece of junk. It acts possessed, randomly switching screens and typing without my even touching it. Save your money!",1
"When I received it, it didn't come with SIM card and the speaker in the phone didn't work, so I couldn't hear anything. It also wouldn't make a call. The phone looked in new condition, but unfortunately didn't work. But I returned it with no questions asked and the process was very easy.",1
"The phone I received was defective. The wifi function of the phone did not work. Thankfully, I had full insurance on my broken iphone that I was attempting to replace. Verizon covered the cost of this phone and provided me with a new one. Never again will I purchase a refurbished phone through Amazon.",1
Received as advertised: Verizon Wireless Apple iPhone 5c. Took it to the Verizon store and had them insert a SIM card and it works great. No complaints.,5
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
"I usually don't complain if something isn't too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. The back is also badly scrapped up! It didn't even come with a charger!",1
nice price for phone but the motherboard of the phone sticks and i cant text or do anything with the phone. i thought i wait it out to see what else can be done for the phone nothing,1
"The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase.",3
Very satisfied with the quality. This was the first time I'd bought a used phone and I'm very satisfied. The return policy and pictures made me feel better about ordering and I'm likely to do this again in the future.,5
Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone.,1
The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone.,3
"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money.",1
Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store,5
"I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating.",2
I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new! Also love the case but I do use other ones. In the pics I have a sticker button and a screen protector so I can't show you the screen,5
"Got this from Doc and Roc Overstock through Amazon as a replacement for my wife's phone. Seller was awesome and super fast, device works wonderfully. No complaints, everything working perfectly.",5
The iPhone itself works like a charm! I was very pleased with my purchase. However the charger that came with the iPhone was very short and charged the phone really slow which wasn't too big of a problem being that you can get another charger for a small price. Overall I love the iPhone. Thanks!,5
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good.",1
"The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it.",2
"This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no?",4
The 5c is an awesome device. This device doesn't just come in black or white like all of the other iPhones. The plastic build is also good quality and feels durable.,5
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see.,4
"The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too!",4
"The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back.",2
"The description said it was in 'very good' condition, but when I actually received the phone it was in perfect condition. No nicks or scratches period. Definitely recommend.",5
Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together!,2
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol.,1
The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it,1
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought.,1
"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap.",1
"I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested!",1
The phone was a gift to my grandson to replace his broken phone. It was just as described and was easy to set up. Everything migrated over very easily and completely. Phone was in very good condition,5
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new .,2
"I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline.",1
I ordered my phone Tuesday night at almost midnight and received it today even though shipping said May 17- June 2. I use AT&T go phone and all I had to do was go into my local store for a sim card and they set it up! So pleased with this purchase,5
"Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody!",5
"For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it.",5
The phone came within a week. The phone fit the description and it was unlocked for me to use. Phone was in great condition and will definitely order again.,5
"I got this few days before Christmas and it came it right in time. The phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. My daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. So far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there's any concern on the phone, hopefully not.",5
"The phone is new. Everything is included in the package. However, the ICCID of the SIM was identified by AT&T as permanently disabled. So instead of being able to activate it online, I'm going to have to the nearest AT&T store an hour away.5 stars for the phone itself. 3 starts for the BS SIM card.",3
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy,1
"Great phone for my daughter. She still has it. Was practically new when I received it. Seller was wonderful and very helpful with some of the technical issues we had, not with the phone. Would highly recommend him.",5
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
I was happy I got a case and a charger that was in the description but I was told the phone works perfectly fine but it doesn't. The phone twitches which is beyond annoying. I don't appreciate that,1
"I was nervous about getting a used phone,but so far I have not had any problems .It works and functions every bit as good as the new iPhone I had before someone stole in hospital lobby as I was charging it!..My contract wasn't up and I couldn't afford the 500~600 for another one!",5
"The delivery was fast, the phone is in good shape for the most part. The earphone port is broken though. My earphones can't go all the way in which is upsetting because I am that person that uses my earphones nonstop!",2
The phone arrived earlier than anticipated and it is absolutely as good as new. I am very pleased and will definitely work with this seller when my husband purchases a new phone in a few months. No complaints at all!,5
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage. It's simple but effective. The seller didn't fail to give good service. The iPhone 's legit and I love it!",5
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,2
Cell phone works as expected. So far no problems with the cell phone.Had a little trouble with the charger but had no problems at all getting a replacement. Customer service was great. Will differently buy again in the future.,5
I bought this phone for my husband for his birthday. He was still using his original flip phone from 2006 prior to this. He is so glad that I got this phone. He doesn't know why he didn't change to this sooner. He found it easy to use.,5
"It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again",5
"The phone was in the condition as advertised which was ""fair"". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen",3
Absolutely Awful This seller sold me a lost or stolen phone that has a block on it. The phone appearance was great however I could not get it activated because there was a system block on the phone.beyond angry! 0stars!!!,1
"I'm not a fan of Apple anymore, I had gotten it to do Face Time with my little cousin but I was under the assumption it was an AT&T Phone I could use on Straight Talk but turned out it was a Sprint phone. If you like iPhones it's nice but I found it too small as well",1
at this time the phone works fine. The cables were not a Apple approved charging cable and they were disabled by Itunes. Had to spend more money on a cable,3
"Phone was in decent physical shape but the battery sucks. When I went to replace it someone had glued the battery in, some the screws were missing to the circuit boards. Now the phone freezes and restarts very often.",1
I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster.,1
"Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the ""best"" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both.",5
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
Purchases a used iPhone and that's what it got. Looks used with scratches on screen. I put an Otter box on it for protection but it also works to cover used look. Phone works great. Good phone for kids.,4
"Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast.",5
"Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract.",3
Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs.,5
"The phone arrived and the touch on the screen is messed up. :( It works okay sometimes but most of the time if I touch something, it reads like I touched another part of the screen and something else opens instead. Very frustrating.",1
"it has a glitch that drops wifi, and you can't simply turn it back on. shut it off, then reboot, and wifi capability returns. otherwise, it's been a good phone. it's used, after all. even a new one can have a glitch, over time.",4
"The phone was on time and no cracks, but minor wear. However, after a week it blanked out and gave me issues, it does this once every few weeks.But other than that, I do enjoy my phone.",4
"Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a ""new"" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work.",1
"The iPhone heats up & battery dies too fast & I only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don't seem like it. From internal conditions. looks great, don't work great:(",2
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5
Just received my iPhone 5c used but like brand new:) working so far perfectly on WiFi only.. Will hook up with AT&T Monday.. From HandHeld Heroes as promised.. With charger.. Will be doing business with them again.. Can't say enough nice stuff about them!,5
"Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful.",1
"This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!!",5
"Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price.",4
"Great deal for an iPhone! We use it for our tween (and as backup for Waze and other apps) as an AT&T GoPhone. Since the case is less robust than the other iPhones, we got an Otterbox case and so far it's been working great!",5
"I have had phone for a short time and the top of the screen started to crack without me going anything. I thought I was purchasing a quality product, but I was mistaken. I have been an Amazon prime shopper for a long time and this has been my worst purchase.",1
"Brought for my Grandaughter and she loves it, still working strong.....now she want the one that works underwater, so then this phone will soon be mine....I guess I need to get updated shortly from my good ole Pantech Matrix flip phone with keypad....",5
"When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone.",1
"The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back.",2
"This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no?",4
The 5c is an awesome device. This device doesn't just come in black or white like all of the other iPhones. The plastic build is also good quality and feels durable.,5
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see.,4
"The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too!",4
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"I received the phone on time. The phone works really good, but there is a scratch on the back but its not really a big deal for me. I would recommend this phone and the apple outlet store. 100% satisfied on this phone.",4
"Great price for working product in good condition. They did leave out the fact that you need to buy new sim card with this phone, which may have been common sense but it still would have been nice to know. The charger cord that came with it also quit working within a couple of days.",4
"The phones screen broke right away, and just keeps cracking. The refurbisher did not do a good job. Plus the battery dies constantly. Hope others take the time to provide feedback so the rip off doesn't continue.",1
"I'm extremely happy with my purchase. It was a present for my son. The price was great. The pictures weren't entirely accurate. My experience is that the phone that arrived was in much better condition than the one in the pic. I called and asked them to ship it earlier, which they did.",5
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
Honestly freaked me out a little because it did not come with a sim card but I should'nt have expected that anyways. The seller gave nice institutions on what to do about getting a sim card and activating the phone. My phone is now activated and i am very happy!,5
This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day!,5
This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time.,1
Bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and the phone will not hold a charge. Have to take it to an Apple store to have it repaired. Very unhappy about this.,1
Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever.,5
"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star.",4
"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!",4
"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it.",1
"There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up.",4
"iphone came in original Apple packaging and in only two days with standard shipping. Works with Verizon just like the ad says. New condition, no scuffs or anything. Thanks!",5
These things are extremely brittle. If you were to purchase one I would highly suggest investing in a heavy duty case. I literally have gone through 4 in the last year and I treat it very carefully.Otherwise a nice piece of technology.,3
The iPhone 5c I received is great. The charger and USB cable that came with it have issues. By trial and error I determined the charger barely works. The USB cable has a very small break in it at the edge where it connects with the phone port. It's a disappointment that I have to replace these items immediately.,4
"This phone was NOT compatible with the Verizon network. I had to get a new phone and pay just as much for it. TERRIBLE marketing, don't believe it when it says it is verizon compatible.",1
"The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition. When I received it there were scratches on it, the screen pops up in one corner, and all the accessories were fake with a mispelled word on it. I was very disappointed with this product.",2
works great! was able to take it to veroson and have it activated. Daughter loves it as a replacement for her phone that was stolen. Company answered questions and we received it on time.,5
"Ad stated in mint condition except minor damage on the corner. That was accurate, however, a few of the keys don't work and this was a graduation gift for my son. Very disappointed.",3
"I usually don't complain if something isn't too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. The back is also badly scrapped up! It didn't even come with a charger!",1
nice price for phone but the motherboard of the phone sticks and i cant text or do anything with the phone. i thought i wait it out to see what else can be done for the phone nothing,1
"The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase.",3
"The speaker did not work. I had to trade it to Verizon for $43 because my 11 year old son had been waiting to activate it. We took it in to activate it and it didn't work so I had to buy one at Verizon so as not to disappoint my son on his birthday, He brought his grades up to earn it. I was out $60 and got a phone contract I did not want.",1
"I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the ""P"" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT.",4
"Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great!",4
"The phone I received was defective. The wifi function of the phone did not work. Thankfully, I had full insurance on my broken iphone that I was attempting to replace. Verizon covered the cost of this phone and provided me with a new one. Never again will I purchase a refurbished phone through Amazon.",1
"I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great!",5
"This works great! Exactly as described, like-new in case with all accessories and even included a Verizon sim-card. Activated quickly with no problems. I've now had for about 2 months and it works like a charm!",5
"Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless.",5
LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :),5
"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone.",4
"The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all..",2
"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price.",5
"After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone.",1
"Phone was glitchy, screen becomes unresponsive in the middle and you can only touch the top and bottom of it until you turn it off and turn it back on. Happens at least 20x a day if you open your phone 30x",1
"The phone arrived promptly as it was a Christmas present. However, the screen began to lift two days after Christmas and the phone froze up. Returned the item on January 6, 2015 and waiting patiently for a return.",2
Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever.,5
"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile.",5
"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money.",1
Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store,5
My son is disatisfied with his phone. It does not consistently work. He isn't able to text or answer calls part of the time. Not sure if it just needs a new screen.,1
"This phone was labeled to be in ""good condition"" instead of excellent or like new- it seemed brand new! No scratches or anything. Very pleased with this purchase.",5
"Great phone replacement for our other phone. Shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren't as many defects on the phone as described. It was better.",5
"Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months...",2
Honestly freaked me out a little because it did not come with a sim card but I should'nt have expected that anyways. The seller gave nice institutions on what to do about getting a sim card and activating the phone. My phone is now activated and i am very happy!,5
"I purchased this phone from cellcow through Amazon. The phone was a piece of junk. It acts possessed, randomly switching screens and typing without my even touching it. Save your money!",1
"When I received it, it didn't come with SIM card and the speaker in the phone didn't work, so I couldn't hear anything. It also wouldn't make a call. The phone looked in new condition, but unfortunately didn't work. But I returned it with no questions asked and the process was very easy.",1
This phone is stuck in the year 1970 and when I try to change the year it just keeps skipping over all of them.. and then the screen wouldn't work when I plugged it in with the charger.. really hope this can be a quick fix otherwise I'll be very disappointed...waste of my money I guess.,3
"Perfect condition. Barely looks touched. No scrapes, scratches or Knicks. It came completely cleaned out and ready for me to use. Charges super fast. No technical issues",5
Cosmetically it matched the description. It took 2 hours to get the phone activated at the Verizon store. I was worried it was not going to work. The phone keeps freezing and I have to keep resetting it to get text messages.,2
Have had the phone a couple months. Daughter dropped it on a carpeted floor from only about 3 ft away - cracked the screen. I doubt we'll be replacing it with another i5 as we hear that is a problem with them.,3
Very satisfied with the quality. This was the first time I'd bought a used phone and I'm very satisfied. The return policy and pictures made me feel better about ordering and I'm likely to do this again in the future.,5
Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone.,1
The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone.,3
"Awesome first phone for my 9 yr old. Not too $$$ that if he loses it or breaks it, it will break my bank and the ease of iOS for him is good. Pretty study as well for his needs. Battery life is really good on these.",5
"Exactly what I was looking for! My daughter wanted an iPhone for her birthday and I didn't want to spend a fortune and this was just what I wanted! The condition was nearly perfect, it came quickly and it was exactly as promised!",5
"Just as described. Due to my mistake, I had to send it back. I ordered the Iphone 6. Best value I could find. Great customer support. Wonderful to work with.",5
"DO NOT BUY. When i purchased this phone it was sold to me as a NEW phone, not refurbished. It is clear now that the phone WAS refurbished and the battery only lasted a few month.",1
"After reviewing the phone and trying everything ywsteady to switch over to this phone it would not work. I ordered a new sim as well. Long story short, boh were a waste of my time and money and the phone did not come with a charger. The phone itself is in great condition, but was a waste for me.",1
These things are extremely brittle. If you were to purchase one I would highly suggest investing in a heavy duty case. I literally have gone through 4 in the last year and I treat it very carefully.Otherwise a nice piece of technology.,3
The iPhone 5c I received is great. The charger and USB cable that came with it have issues. By trial and error I determined the charger barely works.

"iphone came in original Apple packaging and in only two days with standard shipping. Works with Verizon just like the ad says. New condition, no scuffs or anything. Thanks!",5
Received as advertised: Verizon Wireless Apple iPhone 5c. Took it to the Verizon store and had them insert a SIM card and it works great. No complaints.,5
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
"The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition. When I received it there were scratches on it, the screen pops up in one corner, and all the accessories were fake with a mispelled word on it. I was very disappointed with this product.",2
It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page.,2
"Came in great condition. No SIM included and the information booklet was missing, as well as a few dints. However this was as expected so overall I am stoked!",4
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2

Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good.",1
"The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it.",2
"Phone was in decent physical shape but the battery sucks. When I went to replace it someone had glued the battery in, some the screws were missing to the circuit boards. Now the phone freezes and restarts very often.",1
I ordered my phone Tuesday night at almost midnight and received it today even though shipping said May 17- June 2. I use AT&T go phone and all I had to do was go into my local store for a sim card and they set it up! So pleased with this purchase,5
I was happy I got a case and a charger that was in the description but I was told the phone works perfectly fine but it doesn't. The phone twitches which is beyond annoying. I don't appreciate that,1
"I was nervous about getting a used phone,but so far I have not had any problems .It works and functions every bit as good as the new iPhone I had before someone stole in hospital lobby as I was charging it!..My contract wasn't up and I couldn't afford the 500~600 for another one!",5
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,2
Cell phone works as expected. So far no problems with the cell phone.Had a little trouble with the charger but had no problems at all getting a replacement. Customer service was great. Will differently buy again in the future.,5
"Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody!",5
"For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it.",5
The phone came within a week. The phone fit the description and it was unlocked for me to use. Phone was in great condition and will definitely order again.,5
"The delivery was fast, the phone is in good shape for the most part. The earphone port is broken though. My earphones can't go all the way in which is upsetting because I am that person that uses my earphones nonstop!",2
The phone arrived earlier than anticipated and it is absolutely as good as new. I am very pleased and will definitely work with this seller when my husband purchases a new phone in a few months. No complaints at all!,5
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol.,1
I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new! Also love the case but I do use other ones. In the pics I have a sticker button and a screen protector so I can't show you the screen,5
"Got this from Doc and Roc Overstock through Amazon as a replacement for my wife's phone. Seller was awesome and super fast, device works wonderfully. No complaints, everything working perfectly.",5
The iPhone itself works like a charm! I was very pleased with my purchase. However the charger that came with the iPhone was very short and charged the phone really slow which wasn't too big of a problem being that you can get another charger for a small price. Overall I love the iPhone. Thanks!,5
Purchases a used iPhone and that's what it got. Looks used with scratches on screen. I put an Otter box on it for protection but it also works to cover used look. Phone works great. Good phone for kids.,4
"I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating.",2
"It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again",5
"The phone was in the condition as advertised which was ""fair"". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen",3
Absolutely Awful This seller sold me a lost or stolen phone that has a block on it. The phone appearance was great however I could not get it activated because there was a system block on the phone.beyond angry! 0stars!!!,1
"I'm not a fan of Apple anymore, I had gotten it to do Face Time with my little cousin but I was under the assumption it was an AT&T Phone I could use on Straight Talk but turned out it was a Sprint phone. If you like iPhones it's nice but I found it too small as well",1
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought.,1
"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap.",1
"I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested!",1
The phone was a gift to my grandson to replace his broken phone. It was just as described and was easy to set up. Everything migrated over very easily and completely. Phone was in very good condition,5
"Great phone for my daughter. She still has it. Was practically new when I received it. Seller was wonderful and very helpful with some of the technical issues we had, not with the phone. Would highly recommend him.",5
The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it,1
"I have had phone for a short time and the top of the screen started to crack without me going anything. I thought I was purchasing a quality product, but I was mistaken. I have been an Amazon prime shopper for a long time and this has been my worst purchase.",1
"Brought for my Grandaughter and she loves it, still working strong.....now she want the one that works underwater, so then this phone will soon be mine....I guess I need to get updated shortly from my good ole Pantech Matrix flip phone with keypad....",5
I bought this phone for my husband for his birthday. He was still using his original flip phone from 2006 prior to this. He is so glad that I got this phone. He doesn't know why he didn't change to this sooner. He found it easy to use.,5
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5
Just received my iPhone 5c used but like brand new:) working so far perfectly on WiFi only.. Will hook up with AT&T Monday.. From HandHeld Heroes as promised.. With charger.. Will be doing business with them again.. Can't say enough nice stuff about them!,5
"Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful.",1
"The description said it was in 'very good' condition, but when I actually received the phone it was in perfect condition. No nicks or scratches period. Definitely recommend.",5
Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together!,2
"Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast.",5
"Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract.",3
Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs.,5
"When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone.",1
at this time the phone works fine. The cables were not a Apple approved charging cable and they were disabled by Itunes. Had to spend more money on a cable,3
I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster.,1
"Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the ""best"" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both.",5
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new .,2
"I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline.",1
"This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no?",4
The 5c is an awesome device. This device doesn't just come in black or white like all of the other iPhones. The plastic build is also good quality and feels durable.,5
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see.,4
"The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too!",4
The screen was popped out. It had scratches on the back. Didn't match description. I dropped it on a soft surface and my screen was jacked. I had to pay to get it fixed.,1
Received my phone faster than expected. Just what I wanted. The phone has been working just fine. The price was right and I have enjoyed using the phone.,4
Love the phone got here on time....At first i had read it would have a few scratches but you cant even tell. Thank you love the phone...plus any questions i had they would right away answer them....,5
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage. It's simple but effective. The seller didn't fail to give good service. The iPhone 's legit and I love it!",5
I bought this phone for my husband for his birthday. He was still using his original flip phone from 2006 prior to this. He is so glad that I got this phone. He doesn't know why he didn't change to this sooner. He found it easy to use.,5
I was happy I got a case and a charger that was in the description but I was told the phone works perfectly fine but it doesn't. The phone twitches which is beyond annoying. I don't appreciate that,1
"I was nervous about getting a used phone,but so far I have not had any problems .It works and functions every bit as good as the new iPhone I had before someone stole in hospital lobby as I was charging it!..My contract wasn't up and I couldn't afford the 500~600 for another one!",5
I ordered my phone Tuesday night at almost midnight and received it today even though shipping said May 17- June 2. I use AT&T go phone and all I had to do was go into my local store for a sim card and they set it up! So pleased with this purchase,5
"The delivery was fast, the phone is in good shape for the most part. The earphone port is broken though. My earphones can't go all the way in which is upsetting because I am that person that uses my earphones nonstop!",2
The phone arrived earlier than anticipated and it is absolutely as good as new. I am very pleased and will definitely work with this seller when my husband purchases a new phone in a few months. No complaints at all!,5
The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it,1
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody!",5
"For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it.",5
The phone came within a week. The phone fit the description and it was unlocked for me to use. Phone was in great condition and will definitely order again.,5
"Great phone for my daughter. She still has it. Was practically new when I received it. Seller was wonderful and very helpful with some of the technical issues we had, not with the phone. Would highly recommend him.",5
"Phone was in decent physical shape but the battery sucks. When I went to replace it someone had glued the battery in, some the screws were missing to the circuit boards. Now the phone freezes and restarts very often.",1
"I have had phone for a short time and the top of the screen started to crack without me going anything. I thought I was purchasing a quality product, but I was mistaken. I have been an Amazon prime shopper for a long time and this has been my worst purchase.",1
"Brought for my Grandaughter and she loves it, still working strong.....now she want the one that works underwater, so then this phone will soon be mine....I guess I need to get updated shortly from my good ole Pantech Matrix flip phone with keypad....",5
"The phone arrived and the touch on the screen is messed up. :( It works okay sometimes but most of the time if I touch something, it reads like I touched another part of the screen and something else opens instead. Very frustrating.",1
"it has a glitch that drops wifi, and you can't simply turn it back on. shut it off, then reboot, and wifi capability returns. otherwise, it's been a good phone. it's used, after all. even a new one can have a glitch, over time.",4
"The phone was on time and no cracks, but minor wear. However, after a week it blanked out and gave me issues, it does this once every few weeks.But other than that, I do enjoy my phone.",4
"Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a ""new"" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work.",1
"The iPhone heats up & battery dies too fast & I only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don't seem like it. From internal conditions. looks great, don't work great:(",2
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
"I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating.",2
"when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good.",1
"The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it.",2
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought.,1
"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap.",1
"I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested!",1
The phone was a gift to my grandson to replace his broken phone. It was just as described and was easy to set up. Everything migrated over very easily and completely. Phone was in very good condition,5
I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new! Also love the case but I do use other ones. In the pics I have a sticker button and a screen protector so I can't show you the screen,5
"Got this from Doc and Roc Overstock through Amazon as a replacement for my wife's phone. Seller was awesome and super fast, device works wonderfully. No complaints, everything working perfectly.",5
The iPhone itself works like a charm! I was very pleased with my purchase. However the charger that came with the iPhone was very short and charged the phone really slow which wasn't too big of a problem being that you can get another charger for a small price. Overall I love the iPhone. Thanks!,5
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,2
Cell phone works as expected. So far no problems with the cell phone.Had a little trouble with the charger but had no problems at all getting a replacement. Customer service was great. Will differently buy again in the future.,5
"I got this few days before Christmas and it came it right in time. The phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. My daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. So far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there's any concern on the phone, hopefully not.",5
"The phone is new. Everything is included in the package. However, the ICCID of the SIM was identified by AT&T as permanently disabled. So instead of being able to activate it online, I'm going to have to the nearest AT&T store an hour away.5 stars for the phone itself. 3 starts for the BS SIM card.",3
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy,1
"This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!!",5
"Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price.",4
"Great deal for an iPhone! We use it for our tween (and as backup for Waze and other apps) as an AT&T GoPhone. Since the case is less robust than the other iPhones, we got an Otterbox case and so far it's been working great!",5
"It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again",5
"The phone was in the condition as advertised which was ""fair"". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen",3
Absolutely Awful This seller sold me a lost or stolen phone that has a block on it. The phone appearance was great however I could not get it activated because there was a system block on the phone.beyond angry! 0stars!!!,1
"I'm not a fan of Apple anymore, I had gotten it to do Face Time with my little cousin but I was under the assumption it was an AT&T Phone I could use on Straight Talk but turned out it was a Sprint phone. If you like iPhones it's nice but I found it too small as well",1
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
Purchases a used iPhone and that's what it got. Looks used with scratches on screen. I put an Otter box on it for protection but it also works to cover used look. Phone works great. Good phone for kids.,4
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol.,1
"Phone Came On Time ! i was very excited and it came just How it was described , ( no charger , and unlocked , 16GB , ect ) it does Have very light scratches on the back But a good Ole case Will take care of that !!!!!!!! the screen is perfectly clear , phone works just as new , Thank Youu!",4
Incredibly disappointed and angry. Bought phone for son (his first) who was very excited to get. Took to Sprint store to get added to plan only to find out phone is reported as stolen. In process of return which I hope goes better than the purchase itself. Yet to be determined.,1
"Product as described, fast shipping. We struggled to get it working and ended up at the Sprint store. Could have been ""user error"". Other than that, no hiccups or issues. Have had the phone for 2 weeks, so far so good.",5
"Phone came in Like New condition as advertised; this includes the condition of the earbuds and charger as well. No trouble activating the device, just had to get a new SIM card from my carrier.Overall, very satisfied with the condition and performance of this device. Great experience and shipping was extremely fast.",5
"For the most part the phone works well. However, it does not work as well as the description says. Phone shuts down and shows low battery icon whenever the camera is opened or flash is used. The power cord that came with the home did not work. Overall, it meets every expectation you think of when you order a cell phone online for $100.",3
"2nd try at buying a phone and having it activated on my sprint account. Don't know if its the phones or sprint just sucks. Probably the latter, but I'm done with the trying to save money by buying a used phone.",1
"I received this phone on 04th of March, now the phone don't work well and the clock doesn't work anymore, in addition at the apple store told me that the phone is not new but born on 2014, the supplier, the supplier don' t help me well.",1
After the first phone we ordered was unable to activate because the serial number was reported Lost/Stolen. The replacement phone the glass was not even fils with the phone indicating that it was refurbished.,1
Better than I ever expected! Brand new Sprint iPhone still in the package. I broke my 5c and Sprint wanted to charge me $600 for a new phone. I saved myself a bundle finding this gem. They swapped my SIM card and activated this awesome phone.,5
The phone was like new. Only needed a sims card which I got for free from the Apple store and had it installed at the Sprint store. It's working out great!,5
"I switched to Sprint and got an HTC One, It is a good phone but before that I had an iPhone 4s, couldn't live without an iPhone i guess! very happy with my switch back to an iPhone!Shipping was fast!",5
"My son words, I wish it wasn't activated!! so Mom had to return it.. Very good condition and for the price of phone was reasonable He was very Disappointed...",3
Phone is great no problems with that. Sims card is the problem and sprint is the biggest problem on getting one. Not the phone guys problem but sprint is just a pain to deal with period. finally after 2 weeks of fighting with sprint they are sending me a new sims card.,3
"I'm an Android person, got an I-phone 4 and HATED it, decided I'd be an Android person forever, but then I thought I'd try this and I really like it. With all the changes and updates it does most of the Android stuff, easier to clean up memory, the only thing it's missing is Swype.",5
It is less expensive than the iphone 5s and I bought it with no contract to replace the iphone 4s that she had. She loves it and I think the phone looks nice and sleek.,5
There was an issue with the ESN number of this phone. We were unable to use the phone.The seller was easy to work with to give me a quick refund. We still have no phone unfortunatly.,1
"Exactly what I wanted! Phone is in great condition.. Only problem was the SIM card was reported lost or stolen, so had to go to the sprint store and get a new one..",4
"Product I returned it , it was locked because it was reported stolen. Sprint the informed me the device will not work because it's looked because it's stolen item.",1
The add said very good condition not even close the back has obvious signs it has taken at least 2 drops and the screen looks like someone cleaned it with steel wool,1
Really fast shipping and is great quality and all I had to do was make an appointment with apple and they gave me a free SIM card then the phone was turned on,5
"The phone was labeled on Amazon as ""new"", but when I went to get it set up, they told me this phone has a contract on it with another carrier and can't be set up till the contract is paid off. Not very happy with ""ChubbiesTech"". The phone guy chuckled when I told him we got it from ChubbiesTech because he said it happens a lot with their phones.",1
"I went to sprint service for TWO HOURS so I can activate it and they can't do it because this phone is not for sprint, if I were you I wouldn't buy this phone just save up your money",1
"Do not buy, could not activate iPhone due to it still being linked to another account that was not paid up to date..sending back immediately..waste of time and money",1
I took it to the sprint store to get a sim card. told me it's not on their network. Now im stuck.. I have sprint. You lied to me. They don't even know which network it's apart of so i can't do anything.,1
I liked the phone but unfortunately I had to ship it back due to me not being able to switch to Sprint service. Everything else about the phone is great including the appearance and performance of the phone.,4
I am having the hardest time getting a SIM card. Apple said they can't give me one. All the sprint stores around me are out but I finally found a sprint store that would give me a free SIM card if I activated my phone there. So I did. And I love my new phone. (:,5
Very disappointed the iphone 5c eye received already been activatied and has an outstanding bill So Not Happy it was 4 my daughters 16th b-day she is so sad,1
Quick and easy! Got it fast and activated it without a problem. I liked it so much I bought another for my wife from this company. I highly recommend them.,5
I bought this I-Phone for my dtr. but I had to return it because it couldn't be unlocked for any other network. phone is beautiful blue. great phone but we just didn't want to be on phone plan,3
"So far so good..... Ordered it Feb 6, 2015 & rcvd it Feb 10, 2015. No problem getting a sim card & having the phone activated. Really no signs of a used phone that i can see. Great seller!",4
"The iPhone is great, it's the connection to sprint that is terrible. I can't believe they won't unlock their phones. I would encourage anyone to stay away from a phone connected to sprint.",1
Very upset with this purchase. Phone cane with a simcard already active on another account. Took 3 weeks for my carrier to get me a fresh one. Bad experience,1
"Was not a sprint phone like it claims in the title. The sprint store also claims that its refurbished, which is not indicated anywhere in the discription. Very disappointed.",1
"When I got the phone it was in perfect condition. Then when I went to go activate it, it turned it that it had a previous owner with a outstanding balance with sprint so I could not use it. Very disappointed.",1
"We paid the ""new"" price for this phone, but the one that arrived was used. When we went to activate with Sprint, we were told that the prior owner left a balance owing and that we had to pay that in order to activate the phone. I am trying to return phone now.",1
"Great phone, great service despite not reading the fine print that it doesn't come with a SIM card. Easy fix from my phone carrier and after a friendly email exchange from the shipping carrier all was taken care of.",5
"Love the phone.The only problem was finding a sprint store for the Sim card, but finally found one.Phone is working very good.No problems so far.Came with head phones and phone charger.The phone was New.",4
Came in. Early but terrible! Would't get it unless you can work it properly. It didn't even come with a charger. When said it would be provided. Also it doesn't read my SIM card and won't let you use it like a regular phone. A SIM card is needed to get pass set up.,1
"Perfect phone! Only down fall was that I wasn't aware you had to go to sprint to get a SIM card, so that was awkward Christmas morning! But overall great experience.",4
"Not pleased with it , tried to get it connected with sprint. But sprint came back saying the serial number was bad and that it was clearly not a sprint phone . Like the seller clearly states in the title",1
"Couldn't even activated it when it came in . Had to get sprint to do some extra stuff with it , my service still blinks out sometimes like I don't have a SIM card in it",2
I was unable to get the phone activated because I have a T-Mobile phone!! I couldn't get anyone to unlock the phone so I could get the SIMS card that I had to buy to work. The package it came in was also cracked on the edge...,2
When I got to the inside of the memory of the phone found out it was from Mexico... I guess peso for dollar i got the right trade for the phone. It works great no issues been able to converge all the files I desire and the call capability is exactly whAt I needed,4
"I have been using the phone for around three weeks with no complaint so far. Exactly as described, functioned with Sprint as advertised, nothing hidden",5
Phone works perfectly!! Activated with no issues. Description was on point. Screen was fine with minor minor minor scratches. No nicks or chips anywhere. VERY SATISFIED with this purchase. And I got it in a timely fashion without expedited shipping. Definitely would recommend to anyone!!!,5
"The flash/light does not work, which could really be useful at some times. Also, when I tried activating the phone it shows up as being BLUE cell instead of GREEN with my cellular service. Everything else works pretty well.",3
Just as described. I contacted seller for a faster shipping option as I was without a phone and he hooked me up. I received it within days! It also came with the SIM card so all I had to do was contact Sprint to activate and I was in business!This is my first iPhone so I am still learning all of it's functions.,5
well i don't have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star,3
The item arrived in a timely manner. It was exactly as advertised and contained all the bells and whistles that I expected.. I could not be more pleased.,5
"ugh I asked for the pink and a green one came, also it came cracked with no charger, no headphones not even a box! im super pissed that I wasted my money on that.",1
Phone works great! Had a few problems with the battery and audio but vendor helped me resolve these issues. Phone was in great conditions like stated. this is a great deal.,5
"very pleased with this purchase. I was skeptical buying a previously owned iphone but just couldnt see paying full price for a brand new one since we werent eligible for an upgrade yet. It was a gift for my daughter for christmas. It was in such good shape with the box and all, she had no idea it was previously owned.",5
"For the most part the phone works well. However, it does not work as well as the description says. Phone shuts down and shows low battery icon whenever the camera is opened or flash is used.

"This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no?",4
The 5c is an awesome device. This device doesn't just come in black or white like all of the other iPhones. The plastic build is also good quality and feels durable.,5
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see.,4
"The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too!",4
"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol.,1
"I got this few days before Christmas and it came it right in time. The phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. My daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. So far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there's any concern on the phone, hopefully not.",5
"The phone is new. Everything is included in the package. However, the ICCID of the SIM was identified by AT&T as permanently disabled. So instead of being able to activate it online, I'm going to have to the nearest AT&T store an hour away.5 stars for the phone itself. 3 starts for the BS SIM card.",3
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy,1
I ordered my phone Tuesday night at almost midnight and received it today even though shipping said May 17- June 2. I use AT&T go phone and all I had to do was go into my local store for a sim card and they set it up! So pleased with this purchase,5
"when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good.",1
"The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it.",2
Purchases a used iPhone and that's what it got. Looks used with scratches on screen. I put an Otter box on it for protection but it also works to cover used look. Phone works great. Good phone for kids.,4
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it,1
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone.",1
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
"This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!!",5
"Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price.",4
"Great deal for an iPhone! We use it for our tween (and as backup for Waze and other apps) as an AT&T GoPhone. Since the case is less robust than the other iPhones, we got an Otterbox case and so far it's been working great!",5
"I have had phone for a short time and the top of the screen started to crack without me going anything. I thought I was purchasing a quality product, but I was mistaken. I have been an Amazon prime shopper for a long time and this has been my worst purchase.",1
"Brought for my Grandaughter and she loves it, still working strong.....now she want the one that works underwater, so then this phone will soon be mine....I guess I need to get updated shortly from my good ole Pantech Matrix flip phone with keypad....",5
I had the phone for about two months and all of a sudden it starts shutting off on me and won't stay on contacted the seller and got no response. Horrible service and looks like it was put together like crap,1
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought.,1
"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap.",1
"I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested!",1
The phone was a gift to my grandson to replace his broken phone. It was just as described and was easy to set up. Everything migrated over very easily and completely. Phone was in very good condition,5
"Great phone for my daughter. She still has it. Was practically new when I received it. Seller was wonderful and very helpful with some of the technical issues we had, not with the phone. Would highly recommend him.",5
"The delivery was fast, the phone is in good shape for the most part. The earphone port is broken though. My earphones can't go all the way in which is upsetting because I am that person that uses my earphones nonstop!",2
The phone arrived earlier than anticipated and it is absolutely as good as new. I am very pleased and will definitely work with this seller when my husband purchases a new phone in a few months. No complaints at all!,5
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"The description said it was in 'very good' condition, but when I actually received the phone it was in perfect condition. No nicks or scratches period. Definitely recommend.",5
Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together!,2
"Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast.",5
"Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract.",3
Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs.,5
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5
Just received my iPhone 5c used but like brand new:) working so far perfectly on WiFi only.. Will hook up with AT&T Monday.. From HandHeld Heroes as promised.. With charger.. Will be doing business with them again.. Can't say enough nice stuff about them!,5
"Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful.",1
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new .,2
"I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline.",1
"The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back.",2
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage. It's simple but effective. The seller didn't fail to give good service. The iPhone 's legit and I love it!",5
I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster.,1
"Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the ""best"" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both.",5
I received the phone quickly but am disappointed to say that the headphone /auxiliary cord plug in does not work. One reeson for wanting the iPhone was for music. Paid a decent price for a manufacturer refurbished phone and it does not completely work,3
"Phone Came On Time ! i was very excited and it came just How it was described , ( no charger , and unlocked , 16GB , ect ) it does Have very light scratches on the back But a good Ole case Will take care of that !!!!!!!! the screen is perfectly clear , phone works just as new , Thank Youu!",4
"Love the phone.The only problem was finding a sprint store for the Sim card, but finally found one.Phone is working very good.No problems so far.Came with head phones and phone charger.The phone was New.",4
I bought this I-Phone for my dtr. but I had to return it because it couldn't be unlocked for any other network. phone is beautiful blue. great phone but we just didn't want to be on phone plan,3
"So far so good..... Ordered it Feb 6, 2015 & rcvd it Feb 10, 2015. No problem getting a sim card & having the phone activated. Really no signs of a used phone that i can see. Great seller!",4
Just as described. I contacted seller for a faster shipping option as I was without a phone and he hooked me up. I received it within days! It also came with the SIM card so all I had to do was contact Sprint to activate and I was in business!This is my first iPhone so I am still learning all of it's functions.,5
well i don't have the phone yet but right now ill give it a 5star! I hope it was worth my money update 4/3/16 phone works perfectly for to update... 9/27/16 the screen is very lose pops in and out with the slightest drop. Dropping the score 3star,3
Incredibly disappointed and angry. Bought phone for son (his first) who was very excited to get. Took to Sprint store to get added to plan only to find out phone is reported as stolen. In process of return which I hope goes better than the purchase itself. Yet to be determined.,1
"Product as described, fast shipping. We struggled to get it working and ended up at the Sprint store. Could have been ""user error"". Other than that, no hiccups or issues. Have had the phone for 2 weeks, so far so good.",5
"Phone came in Like New condition as advertised; this includes the condition of the earbuds and charger as well. No trouble activating the device, just had to get a new SIM card from my carrier.Overall, very satisfied with the condition and performance of this device. Great experience and shipping was extremely fast.",5
"For the most part the phone works well. However, it does not work as well as the description says. Phone shuts down and shows low battery icon whenever the camera is opened or flash is used. The power cord that came with the home did not work. Overall, it meets every expectation you think of when you order a cell phone online for $100.",3
"2nd try at buying a phone and having it activated on my sprint account. Don't know if its the phones or sprint just sucks. Probably the latter, but I'm done with the trying to save money by buying a used phone.",1
"I received this phone on 04th of March, now the phone don't work well and the clock doesn't work anymore, in addition at the apple store told me that the phone is not new but born on 2014, the supplier, the supplier don' t help me well.",1
"Had a hard time getting activated from Sprint and when activated the ear piece didn't work, had to return to Apple and get a another one and that had the same problem , and back to the Apple store again .",2
"When I bought it the advertisement said... unlocked. Its not true... I tried cancel it, but it was not possible. I need to send back, it's big hard time for me... I lived in Brazil....",1
Great phone! I really thought there would a lot pf scratches on it but there was totally nothing it is like brand new the only complaint i have was that the charger was broken but is ok i bought one and it works perfectly fine thank you for the phone,5
"i absolutely love this product, it was everything the description said. there are a few minor scratches but its barely noticeable, phone works great; it included the charger and headphones. it was sold by the warehouse deals, inc",5
"Do not buy, could not activate iPhone due to it still being linked to another account that was not paid up to date..sending back immediately..waste of time and money",1
I took it to the sprint store to get a sim card. told me it's not on their network. Now im stuck.. I have sprint. You lied to me. They don't even know which network it's apart of so i can't do anything.,1
"very pleased with this purchase. I was skeptical buying a previously owned iphone but just couldnt see paying full price for a brand new one since we werent eligible for an upgrade yet. It was a gift for my daughter for christmas. It was in such good shape with the box and all, she had no idea it was previously owned.",5
I liked the phone but unfortunately I had to ship it back due to me not being able to switch to Sprint service. Everything else about the phone is great including the appearance and performance of the phone.,4
I am having the hardest time getting a SIM card. Apple said they can't give me one. All the sprint stores around me are out but I finally found a sprint store that would give me a free SIM card if I activated my phone there. So I did. And I love my new phone. (:,5
Very disappointed the iphone 5c eye received already been activatied and has an outstanding bill So Not Happy it was 4 my daughters 16th b-day she is so sad,1
Quick and easy! Got it fast and activated it without a problem. I liked it so much I bought another for my wife from this company. I highly recommend them.,5
The item arrived in a timely manner. It was exactly as advertised and contained all the bells and whistles that I expected.. I could not be more pleased.,5
"The flash/light does not work, which could really be useful at some times. Also, when I tried activating the phone it shows up as being BLUE cell instead of GREEN with my cellular service. Everything else works pretty well.",3
"Perfect phone! Only down fall was that I wasn't aware you had to go to sprint to get a SIM card, so that was awkward Christmas morning! But overall great experience.",4
"Not pleased with it , tried to get it connected with sprint. But sprint came back saying the serial number was bad and that it was clearly not a sprint phone . Like the seller clearly states in the title",1
"Couldn't even activated it when it came in . Had to get sprint to do some extra stuff with it , my service still blinks out sometimes like I don't have a SIM card in it",2
I was unable to get the phone activated because I have a T-Mobile phone!! I couldn't get anyone to unlock the phone so I could get the SIMS card that I had to buy to work. The package it came in was also cracked on the edge...,2
"I switched to Sprint and got an HTC One, It is a good phone but before that I had an iPhone 4s, couldn't live without an iPhone i guess! very happy with my switch back to an iPhone!Shipping was fast!",5
"My son words, I wish it wasn't activated!! so Mom had to return it.. Very good condition and for the price of phone was reasonable He was very Disappointed...",3
Phone is great no problems with that. Sims card is the problem and sprint is the biggest problem on getting one. Not the phone guys problem but sprint is just a pain to deal with period. finally after 2 weeks of fighting with sprint they are sending me a new sims card.,3
"The phone was labeled on Amazon as ""new"", but when I went to get it set up, they told me this phone has a contract on it with another carrier and can't be set up till the contract is paid off. Not very happy with ""ChubbiesTech"". The phone guy chuckled when I told him we got it from ChubbiesTech because he said it happens a lot with their phones.",1
"I went to sprint service for TWO HOURS so I can activate it and they can't do it because this phone is not for sprint, if I were you I wouldn't buy this phone just save up your money",1
After the first phone we ordered was unable to activate because the serial number was reported Lost/Stolen. The replacement phone the glass was not even fils with the phone indicating that it was refurbished.,1
"Great phone, great service despite not reading the fine print that it doesn't come with a SIM card. Easy fix from my phone carrier and after a friendly email exchange from the shipping carrier all was taken care of.",5
Came in. Early but terrible! Would't get it unless you can work it properly. It didn't even come with a charger. When said it would be provided. Also it doesn't read my SIM card and won't let you use it like a regular phone. A SIM card is needed to get pass set up.,1
It was shipped on time and was exactly as advertised. In very good condition with only 1 small scratch on the front. Our daughter was thrilled with her Christmas present.,5
I am not the owner of it but I suspect everything is good. It was a gift for a lost soul.Delivery was as stated and on time as promised.Thank you guys so much and have a blessed 2015.Arnold Collins,5
"ugh I asked for the pink and a green one came, also it came cracked with no charger, no headphones not even a box! im super pissed that I wasted my money on that.",1
Phone works great! Had a few problems with the battery and audio but vendor helped me resolve these issues. Phone was in great conditions like stated. this is a great deal.,5
Better than I ever expected! Brand new Sprint iPhone still in the package. I broke my 5c and Sprint wanted to charge me $600 for a new phone. I saved myself a bundle finding this gem. They swapped my SIM card and activated this awesome phone.,5
The phone was like new. Only needed a sims card which I got for free from the Apple store and had it installed at the Sprint store. It's working out great!,5
"I'm an Android person, got an I-phone 4 and HATED it, decided I'd be an Android person forever, but then I thought I'd try this and I really like it. With all the changes and updates it does most of the Android stuff, easier to clean up memory, the only thing it's missing is Swype.",5
It is less expensive than the iphone 5s and I bought it with no contract to replace the iphone 4s that she had. She loves it and I think the phone looks nice and sleek.,5
There was an issue with the ESN number of this phone. We were unable to use the phone.The seller was easy to work with to give me a quick refund. We still have no phone unfortunatly.,1
"Exactly what I wanted! Phone is in great condition.. Only problem was the SIM card was reported lost or stolen, so had to go to the sprint store and get a new one..",4
"Product I returned it , it was locked because it was reported stolen. Sprint the informed me the device will not work because it's looked because it's stolen item.",1
The add said very good condition not even close the back has obvious signs it has taken at least 2 drops and the screen looks like someone cleaned it with steel wool,1
Really fast shipping and is great quality and all I had to do was make an appointment with apple and they gave me a free SIM card then the phone was turned on,5
When I got to the inside of the memory of the phone found out it was from Mexico... I guess peso for dollar i got the right trade for the phone. It works great no issues been able to converge all the files I desire and the call capability is exactly whAt I needed,4
"I have been using the phone for around three weeks with no complaint so far. Exactly as described, functioned with Sprint as advertised, nothing hidden",5
Phone works perfectly!! Activated with no issues. Description was on point. Screen was fine with minor minor minor scratches. No nicks or chips anywhere. VERY SATISFIED with this purchase. And I got it in a timely fashion without expedited shipping. Definitely would recommend to anyone!!!,5
"The iPhone is great, it's the connection to sprint that is terrible. I can't believe they won't unlock their phones. I would encourage anyone to stay away from a phone connected to sprint.",1
Very upset with this purchase. Phone cane with a simcard already active on another account. Took 3 weeks for my carrier to get me a fresh one. Bad experience,1
"Was not a sprint phone like it claims in the title. The sprint store also claims that its refurbished, which is not indicated anywhere in the discription. Very disappointed.",1
"When I got the phone it was in perfect condition. Then when I went to go activate it, it turned it that it had a previous owner with a outstanding balance with sprint so I could not use it. Very disappointed.",1
"We paid the ""new"" price for this phone, but the one that arrived was used. When we went to activate with Sprint, we were told that the prior owner left a balance owing and that we had to pay that in order to activate the phone. I am trying to return phone now.",1
"The phone seems to be decent, but I can't be sure. The listing says it is unlocked, and can be used on Verizon Wireless 4G LTE plans, but when I tried to activate it with the carrier, I was told it cannot be used with them. This was supposed to be my son's 13th birthday gift, now I have to make other plans.",2
I ordered this to replace a previous phone I bought on Amazon that simply stopped working after 1 week. So far this iPhone seems to be working well and I have had no problems. The battery isn't that great but thats to be expected with an older phone.,4
"This phone lasted me 4 good years. Worked very well. I upgraded to a 7 last week & honestly its just like it. Only difference is that the screen on the 7 is bigger. Didn't see much difference in camera. If you like small phones or are scared about dropping a big phone then this phone is just for you. Gets the job of being a phone, done.",5
Bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and the phone will not hold a charge. Have to take it to an Apple store to have it repaired. Very unhappy about this.,1
"The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase.",3
Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever.,5
"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star.",4
"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!",4
"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it.",1
"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money.",1
Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store,5
"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price.",5
"After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone.",1
"I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great!",5
"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile.",5
Received as advertised: Verizon Wireless Apple iPhone 5c. Took it to the Verizon store and had them insert a SIM card and it works great. No complaints.,5
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
"The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition. When I received it there were scratches on it, the screen pops up in one corner, and all the accessories were fake with a mispelled word on it. I was very disappointed with this product.",2
"Awesome first phone for my 9 yr old. Not too $$$ that if he loses it or breaks it, it will break my bank and the ease of iOS for him is good. Pretty study as well for his needs. Battery life is really good on these.",5
"Exactly what I was looking for! My daughter wanted an iPhone for her birthday and I didn't want to spend a fortune and this was just what I wanted! The condition was nearly perfect, it came quickly and it was exactly as promised!",5
"Just as described. Due to my mistake, I had to send it back. I ordered the Iphone 6. Best value I could find. Great customer support. Wonderful to work with.",5
"DO NOT BUY. When i purchased this phone it was sold to me as a NEW phone, not refurbished. It is clear now that the phone WAS refurbished and the battery only lasted a few month.",1
"After reviewing the phone and trying everything ywsteady to switch over to this phone it would not work. I ordered a new sim as well. Long story short, boh were a waste of my time and money and the phone did not come with a charger. The phone itself is in great condition, but was a waste for me.",1
"There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up.",4
"iphone came in original Apple packaging and in only two days with standard shipping. Works with Verizon just like the ad says. New condition, no scuffs or anything. Thanks!",5
"Great phone replacement for our other phone. Shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren't as many defects on the phone as described. It was better.",5
"Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months...",2
Honestly freaked me out a little because it did not come with a sim card but I should'nt have expected that anyways. The seller gave nice institutions on what to do about getting a sim card and activating the phone. My phone is now activated and i am very happy!,5
My son is disatisfied with his phone. It does not consistently work. He isn't able to text or answer calls part of the time. Not sure if it just needs a new screen.,1
"This phone was labeled to be in ""good condition"" instead of excellent or like new- it seemed brand new! No scratches or anything. Very pleased with this purchase.",5
"The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all..",2
"I usually don't complain if something isn't too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. The back is also badly scrapped up! It didn't even come with a charger!",1
nice price for phone but the motherboard of the phone sticks and i cant text or do anything with the phone. i thought i wait it out to see what else can be done for the phone nothing,1
"The phone I received was defective. The wifi function of the phone did not work. Thankfully, I had full insurance on my broken iphone that I was attempting to replace. Verizon covered the cost of this phone and provided me with a new one. Never again will I purchase a refurbished phone through Amazon.",1
These things are extremely brittle. If you were to purchase one I would highly suggest investing in a heavy duty case. I literally have gone through 4 in the last year and I treat it very carefully.Otherwise a nice piece of technology.,3
The iPhone 5c I received is great. The charger and USB cable that came with it have issues. By trial and error I determined the charger barely works. The USB cable has a very small break in it at the edge where it connects with the phone port. It's a disappointment that I have to replace these items immediately.,4
"This phone was NOT compatible with the Verizon network. I had to get a new phone and pay just as much for it. TERRIBLE marketing, don't believe it when it says it is verizon compatible.",1
Very satisfied with the quality. This was the first time I'd bought a used phone and I'm very satisfied. The return policy and pictures made me feel better about ordering and I'm likely to do this again in the future.,5
This phone is stuck in the year 1970 and when I try to change the year it just keeps skipping over all of them.. and then the screen wouldn't work when I plugged it in with the charger.. really hope this can be a quick fix otherwise I'll be very disappointed...waste of my money I guess.,3
"Perfect condition. Barely looks touched. No scrapes, scratches or Knicks. It came completely cleaned out and ready for me to use. Charges super fast. No technical issues",5
"Phone was glitchy, screen becomes unresponsive in the middle and you can only touch the top and bottom of it until you turn it off and turn it back on. Happens at least 20x a day if you open your phone 30x",1
"The phone arrived promptly as it was a Christmas present. However, the screen began to lift two days after Christmas and the phone froze up. Returned the item on January 6, 2015 and waiting patiently for a return.",2
Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever.,5
This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day!,5
This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time.,1
Cosmetically it matched the description. It took 2 hours to get the phone activated at the Verizon store. I was worried it was not going to work. The phone keeps freezing and I have to keep resetting it to get text messages.,2
Have had the phone a couple months. Daughter dropped it on a carpeted floor from only about 3 ft away - cracked the screen. I doubt we'll be replacing it with another i5 as we hear that is a problem with them.,3
"The speaker did not work. I had to trade it to Verizon for $43 because my 11 year old son had been waiting to activate it. We took it in to activate it and it didn't work so I had to buy one at Verizon so as not to disappoint my son on his birthday, He brought his grades up to earn it. I was out $60 and got a phone contract I did not want.",1
"I received the phone on time. The phone works really good, but there is a scratch on the back but its not really a big deal for me. I would recommend this phone and the apple outlet store. 100% satisfied on this phone.",4
"Great price for working product in good condition. They did leave out the fact that you need to buy new sim card with this phone, which may have been common sense but it still would have been nice to know. The charger cord that came with it also quit working within a couple of days.",4
"The phones screen broke right away, and just keeps cracking. The refurbisher did not do a good job. Plus the battery dies constantly. Hope others take the time to provide feedback so the rip off doesn't continue.",1
"I'm extremely happy with my purchase. It was a present for my son. The price was great. The pictures weren't entirely accurate. My experience is that the phone that arrived was in much better condition than the one in the pic. I called and asked them to ship it earlier, which they did.",5
"Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless.",5
LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :),5
"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone.",4
"Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great!",4
"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money.",1
Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store,5
"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price.",5
"After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone.",1
"The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase.",3
"I bought this Apple iPhone 5C 32GB, for my daughter. and she thought it was new. Works like new look new and the battery last a long time too. Great price too. inserted my H20 nano card and worked quick.",5
For the first few months the phone became inoperable once it was plugged in and charging. About 5 months of this I decided I was going to take it to the Apple store and before I even got to the store it started to operate like a normal iphone so im happy and a further 4 months and no problems,4
"Very easy return when we changed our minds and wanted to send it back.Oddly, this expensive item was dropped on our doorstep in a little box with no signature required.",5
"I requested a blue IPhone and I received a green one instead. I can live with that, but it is a bit of an annoyance. also the phone was shipped regular mail and left in my mailbox. I would expect that an item this pricy should be signed for.",4
Great phone for what it is. It may not be metal but it doesn't have to be. It is very sturdy and the fact that is has a more prominent color makes it a lot more special than it's metal siblings.,5
"fast delivery, the phone feels brand new and is unlocked, no scratches or blemishes anywhere on the screen or the body of the phone found, which is good; the screen looks more amazing when powered up. would give it a five star if the plastic frame inside of the box wasn't broken, luckily the phone was unharmed.",4
"I bought this iPhone for my husband his been using it for 3 days already , so far no problems I connect the phone with Metro PCs everything is ok so far.",4
"Did not disappoint at all. Received in great condition with only a few nicks in the corners. Works perfectly. Only problem with it was the charging cord busted within a matter of days and had to go buy a new one. Other than that, perfect!",4
"This was one of three phones I purchased from Amazon third-party because of ""drowned"" phones. Item as described (or better). Very fast shipping. Very satisfied so far!",5
"So far I love this phone. Was told originally by the seller that it would not work with straight talk, but when I got it I put my SIM card in and it worked beautifully.",5
i am back writing thi review after 5 months of having the phone and i can honestly say i am disappointed the phone is in terrible conditions it says its new but its USED the phone wont turn on past the apple logo.,1
I have bought this phone for 3 months.It works great.I love it for several things:1- too light.2- very fast.3- camera is so clear.What I don't like1- screen size is not enough for me.2- its material is plastic.,5

Do not buy this if you need a Verizon phone. I purchased this and after 2 hours on the phone with Verizon and Apple was told it could not be activated because it was a locked Trac phone! Zero stars!!!,1
"I received the item 5 days earlier than expected, it did not come with a charger. It wasn't reset to factory I reset it and there where minor scratches on the screen. I am satisfied with my purchase.",4
"I was nervous before but it has met all expectations, was in good condition and connected to the verizon tower by just inserting my old SIM card, didn't even have to take it to a store. great product",5
"I dropped it on the ""carpet"" a few weeks after getting it and it the screen cracked. Scratches on screen - not super noticeable but made it easier for the the screen to break.The actual phone size is nice. Not too big, not too small.",3
Was refurbished. Should have returned it right away. Had glitches that upgrades would not help. Difficult to use some keys. Split open on the side after a month.,1
This phone came quickly and in great shape like it was brand new. It had all the accessories charger and head phones. I have had it for almost a year now with no issues.,5
"1st one would not connect to the Verizon network after hours on the phone with Verizon and Apple. We sent it back and bought another one thinking the 2nd one would probably work, right? Wrong. Actually sent the 2nd one back and went with a different company. These were not good.",1
I had to send the phone back because it would not hook up to my account. I even had people from the verizon place try and they could not get it to activate on to my account.,1
Excellent condition and just as description mention still had warranty for another 5 months. Also don't have to worry about bending aluminium frames since they're plastic.,5
"Don't listen to the negative feedbacks ""when the hate don't work they start telling lies "" the iPhone looks like nice all my friends were amazed and so was I . But it and you won't regret it 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾 I'm using it now to write this review. Came with just phone but a charger at wal mart is cheap and I have headphones at home.",5
"Just slid my old verizon IPhone SIM card in and it worked right away, perfect condition phone as well. I LOVE it. Thanks so much, I saved a ton of money.",5
"I received the phone a week later! It's brand new out the box, and turned on quickly after going to the verzion store. It's wonderful have to get used to some things... But I all around recommend buying! Won't regret it! 😀",5
Super quick shipping! Was worried about condition until it arrived and was surprised it looks like a new phone no scratches or damage at all. Activated easily with Verizon! Great product and very well priced!,5
When we looked at the phone in the description it did not say that I had a crack and the buttons don't work well well when we got it there was a crack and the buttons don't work well we are going to get the screen fixed but I am disappointed,1
Birthday present for the the new middle school student. All of the features needed for a price that doesn't make his Mom nervous (he tosses it in his backpack). The 5C is a terrific phone and the phone was in like new condition. Would buy again.,5
This item is of good quality and the seller provided the adapter for the phone all arrived within two days. Wow! Excelelnt service.The phone works well as a prepaid thru Verizon. I purchased the SIM card from Walmart and activated the iphone on-line. No problem so far.,4
I had this phone connected to Verizon service and everything worked except you could not make or receive calls. Verizon said it was an issue with the phone. However I did a return and received a full refund very fast. Very happy with the way this return was done.,5
"Items screen was already coming out of the phone, phone already doesn't work after school only a month. Just save another 150 and buy a iPhone 6. They lie about condition",1
Could not connect with verizon after 3 sim cards. They said the cell ID was already in use as everything else worked perfectly but could not make calls.,1
"I dislike the product. For the reason that i cannot activated with Verizon. I even called Verizon and they don't know how to activate it. At this point, i wasted my money for a phone i can't use.",1
"We needed a gift for my father inlaw who never carried a phone. The secret reason was to track where he was with the GPS because they got tired of calling all the neighbors on where he was. It is small, no hard drive for growth, and iPhoneC with only 8Gig was just Enough for those users that just want a phone.",4

"Not even 4 months into owning this phone has it stopped working, well I have no screen. I am getting texts and calls, I just can't respond to them. Not pleased at all!!!!!!",1
"bought this as a gift for my mom's bday, she absolutely adores it, much better than her previous iphone 4, fast and sleek, standard apple product, i might get the pink for myself, shipped super quick, will do business again",4
"This was the best buy for my situation, did not want to give my current phone carrier. They were able to activate this iphone with no problems. thank you.",5
I order this phone as a gift for my niece. I was really unsure to get this on Amazon because I never got an iPhone other than the Apple Store but ended up being a good experience. This is my review:1. Works good.2. The outside conditions are 9/10.3. Software ok!4. Fast delivery5. Headphones and charger works perfect,5
"The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there's a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer",2
IPhone 5c is extremely slow on current iOS. If I take about 30 Pictures and couple of videos the storage is full. It was a mistake buying an 8GB phone.,1
"In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You'd never know this phone wasn't brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!!",5
I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it,1
I ended up taking the phone to Walmart and asked them if they could activate it. The employee inserted a new SIM card in it and activated it thru their Straight Talk wireless. When the only carrier in my small town couldn't or either wouldn't do it. Now it works fine! Will not be sending it back after all.,4
"the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used",2
"This product came earlier than the expected date. Mines were as cheap as 85 dollars , the only difficult is that i needed a sim card to activate my Phone luckily my cousin was there to let me borrow hers . phone came perfectly no scratches or nothing , a charger came with it so i recommend any body to purchase from this seller",5
I was worried at first considering the low price but I'm very happy with the my 5c it had very very small scratches and I was able to put an ATT sim in before switching to cricket wireless.no problems.5 stars all day.,5
Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don't like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one.,2
excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much.,5
You will not get a 1 yr Apple warranty with this purchase. My phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. I contacted Apple and was told it was already replaced. I contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. Horrible experience. Will never buy from this seller.,1
I'm wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound...,1
"I bought Apple I Phone for my mom as a gift, unfortunately it didn't work. I contact seller and I receive refund. I am very happy with customer service. I have never had so nice and understanding service.",4
"Flawless Phone!!! A+++++ besides it being practically new I got it real quick and took 2 minutes to activate with my carrier! Will do business again in a heartbeat! Thanks ""CELLAS""",5
"iphone was indeed unlocked. there was a slight misfit with my charger, but it was promptly replaced by the seller. phone looks good. needs a nano sim - you will need to buy your own for a buck, typically. absolutely new",5
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use.,5
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition.,3
Really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. I would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. Thanks!,5
Love my phone . It was used but it look brand NEW! The only thing I wasn't impressed with is that she sent me fake iPhone headsets but that's okay. Overall great seller. I recommend this seller. @Sharri International Inc 'i got the green one ',5
Got my phone a little while ago and had a little bit of trouble with getting it over and working on Metro PCS . But I got it and am finally #teamiphone !,5
"Sold as new, but I don't think it was. The key to open the sim card slot was missing and there was already a sim card in the phone. Otherwise, all is working well.",2
"The phone arrived extremely fast in just 2 business days, which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected, almost new. It runs great. It arrived with everything the seller said it would in the listing. This was a great buy. I am extremely happy.",5
Thank goodness the phone worked. However the earphones were not the original apple earphones; they looked very cheap and you can tell they aren't from apple.,2
"This is my first iphone ever and I'm 100% satisfied. This iPhone 5c came earlier than it was supposed to arrive, looking brand new, unlocked, with 3 chargers, screen cases, headphones (not regular iPhone headphones though). All in all, I'm a happy camper.",5
Nice looking phone as usual buy Apple just screwed me up yet again with the phone memory it said it was 8gb and turned out to be 5.4 to be precise. Why do they keep shoving us up all their stupid apps that No one ever uses,1
The phone was brand new as advertised but it wasn't factory unlocked. I had to return it. I guess I am gonna stop buying electronic devices through amazon,3
"The seller is very trustworthy, I received the phone safe and sound with no issues on it except that whenever there's pressure on a certain area of the phone screen the screen will kind of go in and out. Very minor detail and doesn't affect phone at all, it just shows that the phone has had its screen replaced before selling.",4
Only had fone for about month and it was stolen. I'm out all that money. No one would do anything for me. Even a discount when I'm ready to purchase another fone. I just felt something could of been done that's a lot of money to be out,1
The phone is beautiful work lovely and no scratches All I have to do is put my Sim card and turn it on and goes work right away I Gave this a five-star cousin I have no problem with it,5
This phone works just fine and as described by the seller. There was not a scratch on it when I received it. I am very satisfied with this phone and would buy from this seller again.,4
"in the description it said it was unlocked but the sim card was locked to att, I had to go to a lot of trouble just to try and unlock the from from att, I had to go in the store presonnally and it took forever. but the phone it self is good.",3
"the phone arrived as described in great condition. it was ready to go to a sprint store and get signed up for a sprint account, etc. I'm using it and loving it! no issues with getting a sim card, etc.",5
The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping.,1
"The phone powered on once, shut off and did not turn back on. The time it did come on, I got a ""white screen of death"" and had to manually restart it. This was incredibly frustrating and irritating.",1
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4
"No problem getting this phone turn on by metro pcs. Works great and my daughter loved it for her birthday. Also, came in the date I was suppose to receive it by.",5
"I'm Having problems receiving calls with this phone...the calls go straight to the voice mail. not every single call though, some friends say that they had to call twice or three times to reach me...I get notifications for missed calls and I can see who called me, but still it's a frustrating problem to have!",1
"The phone works great!!! Although, a few days after I received the phone, the charger that came with it stopped working. I was sent a new charger and it charges my phone very slowly. I let them know again and they are sending me another charger. They help solve their customers problems and I highly recommend you buy their products. HAPPY BUYING (:",5
"Perfect all the way around but if you are a big music fan I recommend getting the one with moré storage, this iPhone has 13 apps and I can only fit about 80 songs",5
"For the price, this is an excellent entry level iOS phone.Its interesting that this phone is cheaper than a new iPod touch.Sister dropped her 4s in the toilet, this was a great replacement to that.",5
Totally better than I expected it to be. Fully functional with no problems what so ever. There is minimal wear and tear but you can barely see it. Will definitely be ordering from you guys again soon!,5
My phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. Not to mention 2 of my letters won't work when I'm typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself,2
"I got this phone day before yesterday. Arrived on time. The phone was sealed and is brand new. Loved it. I bought it for my mother in India. So, I will have to take it to India and check if it works with the service providers there. It should, hopefully. :)",5
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4
I just got my phone today and it keeps freezing I have to lock it than unlock it so it will act right ..I'm so upset and I waited for this phone for so long ..just hope I don't have to pay to get another one,1
"I purchased three phones each phone is in good condition, arrival time was great, received current update from apple, so far so good from three teenagers.",5
"This phone was a great price, and works as intended. i have always been and android user, this is my first IPhone and it works great. i also love the color.",4
"Awesome!!!It had a couple of scuff marks along the edges but other than that I was very pleasantly surprised. It was very affordable, ecspecially for a 14 year old with a small job...so happy....",5
"i bought this product and i choose the option ''new'' now it results its refubrished. it doesnt have warranty anymore, i bought it 4 months ago. What can i do if a need the warranty now. i need an answer",1
"Purchased this for my mom. She loves it.. came when promised. Arrived in immaculate condition. Flawless.. unlocked as promised, everything works no issues, for $150 best iphone 5 u will get. . Charger included. No complaints",5
"recieved this phone today, when i started to set it up I couldnt as it told me it had to be activated by a certain icloud account which was not mine!!!!!!!",1
I purchased 2 of these phones in early Dec 2016. Both phones could not be activated by Verizon. Wasted a lot of my time with Verizona customer support. Very angry.,1
"Perfect size for ease of use, easy to drop the phone with big screen. I thought the plastic material on the back can cause scratch easily, it's actually very not the case.",5
"Phone was NOT NEW as described. Phone stopped working after 8 months. When I took it to the Apple store they told me my phone was a ""Franken-Phone"" made up of parts from many old phones. Apple will not repair it and I seriously doubt I will see my money again. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!",1
"Might be unlucky because this phone itself is unfuctional. It doesn't open half the time when I click the power or home button, sometimes I even flick the mute button for it to work but it doesn't. It only opens when I recieve a call",1
Leary at first puchasing a used phone however couldn't be happier. Looks almost brand new and no problems at all with use. Will start with a used phone from this seller next time shopping for a phone.,5
I like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top. Also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that. I can say other than that it is a good phone.,3
Great iPhone 5C for a used one! Has a few miner scratches but if it wasn't cause of that would off gave it 5 stars. Other than that no complaints works well.,4
The phone I received was defective. The home button does not work. It did arrive a day earlier than expected. Phone powers on and all but cannot exit any app. Cannot return to home screen. Phone is useless. I have to power it off then back on again to get to home screen.,1
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use.,5
"This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed",3
I got my phone yesterday it looked brand new my Sims card counldnt fit in it so I took it to the store got exchange for a pink one but overall the phone look brand new no scratches,3
I was skeptical when I bought this product. It works perfectly. The seller also asked any questions that may arise after purchasing the product. Excellent quality and shipped fast. I highly recommend it,5
I was so skeptical to buy a used phone off here BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! Not a scratch on it and works perfect! Don't buy from anyone else saved so much money and I'm very satisfied,5
"Scam! When I was buying it, it was a sim card, not iPhone! It costed 1 cent and didn't worked. They did it to get reviewes and now are changing description. What a shame!",1
"This was a nightmare. The phone was not unlocked, and it took me forever to try to activate it. Then I found out it was because the phone was reported as STOLEN. I had to send it back and purchase a different phone. Never again will I buy a phone online",1
"It came in excellent condition, runs very good, only sidenote would be a slight scuff on the Sim card tray but other than that very good phone 10/10 would recommend",4
"Purchased for my daughter for t mobile prepaid service. Had to purchase a micro sim card from tmobile and phone worked perfectly. Phone did not come in the standard iphone white box I'm used to, but upon opening it phone looked new and had all the plastic coverings a new phone should have.",5
"Got a great price for iphone 5c. Was delivered in two days, brand new as advertised and my daughter loves it. It works great with AT&T and I get to keep the same plan without having to do the AT&T upgrade for my daughter which is even better deal.",5
"Interestingly, the phone actually came with a Verizon simcard though it claims it will not work with Verizon. My from the big apple is model A1532 which is prossibly an verizon unlocked version. I tested it with my H2O prepaid card and it works well though. Hope this help.",4
"Got it in great shape. Love it. A faulty charger cable caused a bit of a scare, but otherwise, got a quality product for a decent price. Very satisfied.",4
The phone looked like it went through a blender. Deep scratches all over the blue part. Turned the phone on and there was nothing but a line down the side of it. Returned for refund.,1
This was an amazing buy. I was very skeptical considering that its risky to buy a used phone.The phone is exactly as it was advertised. Shipped fast.Its been more than 3 months now and never experienced any issues.,5
"Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.",2
"8GB iPhone is USELESS. iOS takes up nearly /2 the storage -- the device is maxed out after few pictures, songs and chats. DON'T BUY AN 8GB IPHONE!!! Expensive lesson learned.",1
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I was so worried that it would not be what we expected it to be per online pics, but it was! My 2nd worry was whether or not I could get it activated with Metro PCS and of course I was! MY DAUGHTER HAS NO COMPLAINTS>>What u see is what you get! Love It!",5
Great phone! Down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. Learned this the hard way. I'm an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. Spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must.,5
I personally prefer the androids but my daughter loved this phone! It was everything she wanted and I got it at a really good price! It does what she needs and all the extras that she wants. We are happy!,5
"This product came earlier than the expected date. Mines were as cheap as 85 dollars , the only difficult is that i needed a sim card to activate my Phone luckily my cousin was there to let me borrow hers . phone came perfectly no scratches or nothing , a charger came with it so i recommend any body to purchase from this seller",5
I was worried at first considering the low price but I'm very happy with the my 5c it had very very small scratches and I was able to put an ATT sim in before switching to cricket wireless.no problems.5 stars all day.,5
"bought this as a gift for my mom's bday, she absolutely adores it, much better than her previous iphone 4, fast and sleek, standard apple product, i might get the pink for myself, shipped super quick, will do business again",4
"This was the best buy for my situation, did not want to give my current phone carrier. They were able to activate this iphone with no problems. thank you.",5
"I bought Apple I Phone for my mom as a gift, unfortunately it didn't work. I contact seller and I receive refund. I am very happy with customer service. I have never had so nice and understanding service.",4
"Flawless Phone!!! A+++++ besides it being practically new I got it real quick and took 2 minutes to activate with my carrier! Will do business again in a heartbeat! Thanks ""CELLAS""",5
"iphone was indeed unlocked. there was a slight misfit with my charger, but it was promptly replaced by the seller. phone looks good. needs a nano sim - you will need to buy your own for a buck, typically. absolutely new",5
This phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn't go through. I can't return because window has been closed. Apple won't replace because I didn't purchase from them. I'm out $300. I recommend you do not buy!,1
"Sold as new, but I don't think it was. The key to open the sim card slot was missing and there was already a sim card in the phone. Otherwise, all is working well.",2
"The phone arrived extremely fast in just 2 business days, which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected, almost new. It runs great. It arrived with everything the seller said it would in the listing. This was a great buy. I am extremely happy.",5
Really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. I would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. Thanks!,5
Love my phone . It was used but it look brand NEW! The only thing I wasn't impressed with is that she sent me fake iPhone headsets but that's okay. Overall great seller. I recommend this seller. @Sharri International Inc 'i got the green one ',5
"It came very fast, cute phone and of course amazing Apple quality, the only weird thing is that even the phone was new, it came with a sim card inside of the phone...",4
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition.,3
I ended up taking the phone to Walmart and asked them if they could activate it. The employee inserted a new SIM card in it and activated it thru their Straight Talk wireless. When the only carrier in my small town couldn't or either wouldn't do it. Now it works fine! Will not be sending it back after all.,4
"the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used",2
We purchased this item as a gift on Christmas 2014 and this item is still in use. Works like a charm with no problems. Item new in box with all accessories included. Excellent performance quality even in the middle of nowhere. It has been a great phone. We would again purchase the same item from the same seller.,5
I order this phone as a gift for my niece. I was really unsure to get this on Amazon because I never got an iPhone other than the Apple Store but ended up being a good experience. This is my review:1. Works good.2. The outside conditions are 9/10.3. Software ok!4. Fast delivery5. Headphones and charger works perfect,5
"The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there's a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer",2
IPhone 5c is extremely slow on current iOS. If I take about 30 Pictures and couple of videos the storage is full. It was a mistake buying an 8GB phone.,1
Got my phone a little while ago and had a little bit of trouble with getting it over and working on Metro PCS . But I got it and am finally #teamiphone !,5
"Initially had some issues with the phone not being unlocked, seller contacted me and rectified the situation. Phone works great and I am very happy with the product, especially the customer service.",5
"ordered it and it came on time, nothing wrong with the phone. it only cost $15 for a sim card to activate your phone or switch phones (same carrier). truly decent.((my carrier is t-mobile))",5
I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far. Otherwise its a decent iPhone and arrived on time through Amazon Prime which is a terrific service,3
"I ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, I got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. I'm thinking about returning it, but I can't go without a phone for long and I'm not sure how long it'll take for them to get me the right one. I'm bummed out.",1
"Not even 4 months into owning this phone has it stopped working, well I have no screen. I am getting texts and calls, I just can't respond to them. Not pleased at all!!!!!!",1
I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it,1
"The screen had a sort of smudge in the center. We bought the telephone for testing, so we can live with that. But is a defect that wasn't advertised and in my opinion that's not ""very good"" quality.",2
"Do not buy this phone. It is USELESS I REPEAT IT IS USELESS. The screen does not work. These people sell BASURAR on amazon. I don't know y amazon grants them the permission to sell cheap, useless and garbage product on their site.",1
Phone was listed as like new but when we tried to activate it the camera didn't work and you could make a call but the person you were calling couldn't hear you,1
Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don't like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one.,2
excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much.,5
You will not get a 1 yr Apple warranty with this purchase. My phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. I contacted Apple and was told it was already replaced. I contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. Horrible experience. Will never buy from this seller.,1
"I want to know how to have a feedback or return a product that went wrong , buy a iPhone 5c and the start button and a front camera that I do not work",2
"This has been a great cell phone. Price was reasonable and since it was unlocked, was simple to set up service with our carrier. Love the look of the phone (blue) and a good size to fit in pocket, purse, etc.",5
"Arrived in perfect condition; no problem setting up and works like it's brand new. Buying a used phone can be a scary proposition, but this seller is honest/safe.",5
"In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You'd never know this phone wasn't brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!!",5
I'm wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound...,1
"Available memory is definitely more than 8GB - but less than 16, so this is weird and I can't really explain it. The phone looks and works great though, so no complaints so far (I've been using it for a month). I'm using it with T-Mobile.",5
"I would give it less than a star if I canThe phone has issues with connectivity, hearing the other caller, and few days ago I discovered that people call me and can get through, I call others and can't hear themI didn't change my service provider or my location so it is issues with the device",1
This phone looks exactly like the picture! It works great! We inserted the sims card and starting using it immediately! It works better than my 5s that I replaced!,5
"I'm more than happy with my iPhone 5c. I was able to transfer my data from the 3g easily. I bought an AT&T SIM card and was able to activate the new phone via Chat with an AT&T rep. Now I can take advantage of LTE service. I like the new interface and ease of use; I'm impressed with the 5c's camera, too.",5
I expected the phone to have scuffs and scratches but the phone is PERFECT its like its brand new out of the box! But I didn't know it didn't come with a SIM card because it wasn't in the description but other than that I'm overly excited and will purchase from this buyer again!,5
"I bought two of these phones to give my kids as a gift. They arrived on time, were packaged nicely, included all the items l expected and, most importantly they work perfectly. I took them to my local AT&T store and fired them up in about 10 minutes. Simple and easy!",5
"Bought this as a replacement phone for my daughter. She needed one quick while I repair her other phone which she ran over. She loved it and it came just as described, holds its charge and perfect in every way.",5
Description said new phone. Phone had been used not hard to tell considering it came in its original packaging all dirty with finger prints all over screen not very happy was expecting new sealed phone other than that the is in very good condition but not what I was expecting,1
Awesome cellphone. It has a very fast and smooth software. The seller was great from the beginning all the way to the end. Would definitely buy from them again.,5
"Available memory is definitely more than 8GB - but less than 16, so this is weird and I can't really explain it. The phone looks and works great though, so no complaints so far (I've been using it for a month). I'm using it with T-Mobile.",5

Trouble with the memory... Installed WhatsApp application and begun the trouble with the memory but well I will continue use it. I must search a memory card,3
Received it today. So far so good! Charger kinda sucks but phone works great so far. Can always replace the charger. And came with gift! (Cute phone case),4
"Very good condition.........fast comunication with the seller about the iPhone.but too bad the AT&T iPhone is still under contract so can not unlock it and I use the t mobile , so I return it",5
"Great quality, item was brand new in box as described, and was way cheaper than Apple's website. This is a great buy for anyone who doesn't want to spend a ton of money on the newest iPhone, but still wants a very good phone.",5
"Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.",2

"For the price, this is an excellent entry level iOS phone.Its interesting that this phone is cheaper than a new iPod touch.Sister dropped her 4s in the toilet, this was a great replacement to that.",5
Totally better than I expected it to be. Fully functional with no problems what so ever. There is minimal wear and tear but you can barely see it. Will definitely be ordering from you guys again soon!,5

"the phone arrived as described in great condition. it was ready to go to a sprint store and get signed up for a sprint account, etc. I'm using it and loving it! no issues with getting a sim card, etc.",5
The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping.,1
"recieved this phone today, when i started to set it up I couldnt as it told me it had to be activated by a certain icloud account which was not mine!!!!!!!",1

"The phone works great!!! Although, a few days after I received the phone, the charger that came with it stopped working. I was sent a new charger and it charges my phone very slowly. I let them know again and they are sending me another charger. They help solve their customers problems and I highly recommend you buy their products. HAPPY BUYING (:",5
"Perfect all the way around but if you are a big music fan I recommend getting the one with moré storage, this iPhone has 13 apps and I can only fit about 80 songs",5
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4

Thank goodness the phone worked. However the earphones were not the original apple earphones; they looked very cheap and you can tell they aren't from apple.,2
"This is my first iphone ever and I'm 100% satisfied. This iPhone 5c came earlier than it was supposed to arrive, looking brand new, unlocked, with 3 chargers, screen cases, headphones (not regular iPhone headphones though). All in all, I'm a happy camper.",5
Nice looking phone as usual buy Apple just screwed me up yet again with the phone memory it said it was 8gb and turned out to be 5.4 to be precise. Why do they keep shoving us up all their stupid apps that No one ever uses,1
The phone was brand new as advertised but it wasn't factory unlocked. I had to return it. I guess I am gonna stop buying electronic devices through amazon,3
"Got it in great shape. Love it. A faulty charger cable caused a bit of a scare, but otherwise, got a quality product for a decent price. Very satisfied.",4

Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4
"This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed",3
I got my phone yesterday it looked brand new my Sims card counldnt fit in it so I took it to the store got exchange for a pink one but overall the phone look brand new no scratches,3
I was skeptical when I bought this product. It works perfectly. The seller also asked any questions that may arise after purchasing the product. Excellent quality and shipped fast. I highly recommend it,5
"This was a nightmare. The phone was not unlocked, and it took me forever to try to activate it. Then I found out it was because the phone was reported as STOLEN. I had to send it back and purchase a different phone. Never again will I buy a phone online",1
"It came in excellent condition, runs very good, only sidenote would be a slight scuff on the Sim card tray but other than that very good phone 10/10 would recommend",4
I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it,1

"in the description it said it was unlocked but the sim card was locked to att, I had to go to a lot of trouble just to try and unlock the from from att, I had to go in the store presonnally and it took forever. but the phone it self is good.",3
Only had fone for about month and it was stolen. I'm out all that money. No one would do anything for me. Even a discount when I'm ready to purchase another fone. I just felt something could of been done that's a lot of money to be out,1
I purchased 2 of these phones in early Dec 2016. Both phones could not be activated by Verizon. Wasted a lot of my time with Verizona customer support. Very angry.,1
"Perfect size for ease of use, easy to drop the phone with big screen. I thought the plastic material on the back can cause scratch easily, it's actually very not the case.",5
"I'm Having problems receiving calls with this phone...the calls go straight to the voice mail. not every single call though, some friends say that they had to call twice or three times to reach me...I get notifications for missed calls and I can see who called me, but still it's a frustrating problem to have!",1
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use.,5
"The seller is very trustworthy, I received the phone safe and sound with no issues on it except that whenever there's pressure on a certain area of the phone screen the screen will kind of go in and out. Very minor detail and doesn't affect phone at all, it just shows that the phone has had its screen replaced before selling.",4
"I bought Apple I Phone for my mom as a gift, unfortunately it didn't work. I contact seller and I receive refund. I am very happy with customer service. I have never had so nice and understanding service.",4
"Flawless Phone!!! A+++++ besides it being practically new I got it real quick and took 2 minutes to activate with my carrier! Will do business again in a heartbeat! Thanks ""CELLAS""",5
"iphone was indeed unlocked. there was a slight misfit with my charger, but it was promptly replaced by the seller. phone looks good. needs a nano sim - you will need to buy your own for a buck, typically. absolutely new",5
This phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn't go through. I can't return because window has been closed. Apple won't replace because I didn't purchase from them. I'm out $300. I recommend you do not buy!,1
I just got my phone today and it keeps freezing I have to lock it than unlock it so it will act right ..I'm so upset and I waited for this phone for so long ..just hope I don't have to pay to get another one,1
"I purchased three phones each phone is in good condition, arrival time was great, received current update from apple, so far so good from three teenagers.",5
"The phone works great!!! Although, a few days after I received the phone, the charger that came with it stopped working. I was sent a new charger and it charges my phone very slowly. I let them know again and they are sending me another charger. They help solve their customers problems and I highly recommend you buy their products. HAPPY BUYING (:",5
"Perfect all the way around but if you are a big music fan I recommend getting the one with moré storage, this iPhone has 13 apps and I can only fit about 80 songs",5
"This product came earlier than the expected date. Mines were as cheap as 85 dollars , the only difficult is that i needed a sim card to activate my Phone luckily my cousin was there to let me borrow hers . phone came perfectly no scratches or nothing , a charger came with it so i recommend any body to purchase from this seller",5
I was worried at first considering the low price but I'm very happy with the my 5c it had very very small scratches and I was able to put an ATT sim in before switching to cricket wireless.no problems.5 stars all day.,5
"Phone was NOT NEW as described. Phone stopped working after 8 months. When I took it to the Apple store they told me my phone was a ""Franken-Phone"" made up of parts from many old phones. Apple will not repair it and I seriously doubt I will see my money again. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!",1
"Might be unlucky because this phone itself is unfuctional. It doesn't open half the time when I click the power or home button, sometimes I even flick the mute button for it to work but it doesn't. It only opens when I recieve a call",1
"I ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, I got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. I'm thinking about returning it, but I can't go without a phone for long and I'm not sure how long it'll take for them to get me the right one. I'm bummed out.",1
"Not even 4 months into owning this phone has it stopped working, well I have no screen. I am getting texts and calls, I just can't respond to them. Not pleased at all!!!!!!",1
Got my phone a little while ago and had a little bit of trouble with getting it over and working on Metro PCS . But I got it and am finally #teamiphone !,5
"i bought this product and i choose the option ''new'' now it results its refubrished. it doesnt have warranty anymore, i bought it 4 months ago. What can i do if a need the warranty now. i need an answer",1
"Purchased this for my mom. She loves it.. came when promised. Arrived in immaculate condition. Flawless.. unlocked as promised, everything works no issues, for $150 best iphone 5 u will get. . Charger included. No complaints",5
"The screen had a sort of smudge in the center. We bought the telephone for testing, so we can live with that. But is a defect that wasn't advertised and in my opinion that's not ""very good"" quality.",2
"Do not buy this phone. It is USELESS I REPEAT IT IS USELESS. The screen does not work. These people sell BASURAR on amazon. I don't know y amazon grants them the permission to sell cheap, useless and garbage product on their site.",1
Phone was listed as like new but when we tried to activate it the camera didn't work and you could make a call but the person you were calling couldn't hear you,1
"For the price, this is an excellent entry level iOS phone.Its interesting that this phone is cheaper than a new iPod touch.Sister dropped her 4s in the toilet, this was a great replacement to that.",5
Totally better than I expected it to be. Fully functional with no problems what so ever. There is minimal wear and tear but you can barely see it. Will definitely be ordering from you guys again soon!,5
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition.,3
I order this phone as a gift for my niece. I was really unsure to get this on Amazon because I never got an iPhone other than the Apple Store but ended up being a good experience. This is my review:1. Works good.2. The outside conditions are 9/10.3. Software ok!4. Fast delivery5. Headphones and charger works perfect,5
"The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there's a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer",2
IPhone 5c is extremely slow on current iOS. If I take about 30 Pictures and couple of videos the storage is full. It was a mistake buying an 8GB phone.,1
"the phone arrived as described in great condition. it was ready to go to a sprint store and get signed up for a sprint account, etc. I'm using it and loving it! no issues with getting a sim card, etc.",5
The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping.,1
"The phone powered on once, shut off and did not turn back on. The time it did come on, I got a ""white screen of death"" and had to manually restart it. This was incredibly frustrating and irritating.",1
"Sold as new, but I don't think it was. The key to open the sim card slot was missing and there was already a sim card in the phone. Otherwise, all is working well.",2
"The phone arrived extremely fast in just 2 business days, which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected, almost new. It runs great. It arrived with everything the seller said it would in the listing. This was a great buy. I am extremely happy.",5
"recieved this phone today, when i started to set it up I couldnt as it told me it had to be activated by a certain icloud account which was not mine!!!!!!!",1
"I got this phone day before yesterday. Arrived on time. The phone was sealed and is brand new. Loved it. I bought it for my mother in India. So, I will have to take it to India and check if it works with the service providers there. It should, hopefully. :)",5
I ended up taking the phone to Walmart and asked them if they could activate it. The employee inserted a new SIM card in it and activated it thru their Straight Talk wireless. When the only carrier in my small town couldn't or either wouldn't do it. Now it works fine! Will not be sending it back after all.,4
"the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used",2
We purchased this item as a gift on Christmas 2014 and this item is still in use. Works like a charm with no problems. Item new in box with all accessories included. Excellent performance quality even in the middle of nowhere. It has been a great phone. We would again purchase the same item from the same seller.,5
"Scam! When I was buying it, it was a sim card, not iPhone! It costed 1 cent and didn't worked. They did it to get reviewes and now are changing description. What a shame!",1
I like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top. Also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that. I can say other than that it is a good phone.,3
Great iPhone 5C for a used one! Has a few miner scratches but if it wasn't cause of that would off gave it 5 stars. Other than that no complaints works well.,4
The phone I received was defective. The home button does not work. It did arrive a day earlier than expected. Phone powers on and all but cannot exit any app. Cannot return to home screen. Phone is useless. I have to power it off then back on again to get to home screen.,1
I'm wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound...,1
"This phone was a great price, and works as intended. i have always been and android user, this is my first IPhone and it works great. i also love the color.",4
"Awesome!!!It had a couple of scuff marks along the edges but other than that I was very pleasantly surprised. It was very affordable, ecspecially for a 14 year old with a small job...so happy....",5
"Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.",2
"8GB iPhone is USELESS. iOS takes up nearly /2 the storage -- the device is maxed out after few pictures, songs and chats. DON'T BUY AN 8GB IPHONE!!! Expensive lesson learned.",1
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I was so worried that it would not be what we expected it to be per online pics, but it was! My 2nd worry was whether or not I could get it activated with Metro PCS and of course I was! MY DAUGHTER HAS NO COMPLAINTS>>What u see is what you get! Love It!",5
Great phone! Down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. Learned this the hard way. I'm an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. Spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must.,5
I personally prefer the androids but my daughter loved this phone! It was everything she wanted and I got it at a really good price! It does what she needs and all the extras that she wants. We are happy!,5
The phone looked like it went through a blender. Deep scratches all over the blue part. Turned the phone on and there was nothing but a line down the side of it. Returned for refund.,1
This was an amazing buy. I was very skeptical considering that its risky to buy a used phone.The phone is exactly as it was advertised. Shipped fast.Its been more than 3 months now and never experienced any issues.,5
"Initially had some issues with the phone not being unlocked, seller contacted me and rectified the situation. Phone works great and I am very happy with the product, especially the customer service.",5
"Purchased for my daughter for t mobile prepaid service. Had to purchase a micro sim card from tmobile and phone worked perfectly. Phone did not come in the standard iphone white box I'm used to, but upon opening it phone looked new and had all the plastic coverings a new phone should have.",5
"Got a great price for iphone 5c. Was delivered in two days, brand new as advertised and my daughter loves it. It works great with AT&T and I get to keep the same plan without having to do the AT&T upgrade for my daughter which is even better deal.",5
"Interestingly, the phone actually came with a Verizon simcard though it claims it will not work with Verizon. My from the big apple is model A1532 which is prossibly an verizon unlocked version. I tested it with my H2O prepaid card and it works well though. Hope this help.",4

I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it,1

I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far.

I purchased 2 of these phones in early Dec 2016. Both phones could not be activated by Verizon. Wasted a lot of my time with Verizona customer support. Very angry.,1
"Perfect size for ease of use, easy to drop the phone with big screen. I thought the plastic material on the back can cause scratch easily, it's actually very not the case.",5
"bought this as a gift for my mom's bday, she absolutely adores it, much better than her previous iphone 4, fast and sleek, standard apple product, i might get the pink for myself, shipped super quick, will do business again",4

I'm wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound...,1
Thank goodness the phone worked. However the earphones were not the original apple earphones; they looked very cheap and you can tell they aren't from apple.,2
"This is my first iphone ever and I'm 100% satisfied. This iPhone 5c came earlier than it was supposed to arrive, looking brand new, unlocked, with 3 chargers, screen cases, headphones (not regular iPhone headphones though). All in all, I'm a happy camper.",5
Nice looking phone as usual buy Apple just screwed me up yet again with the phone memory it said it was 8gb and turned out to be 5.4 to be precise. Why do they keep shoving us up all their stupid apps that No one ever uses,1
I just got my phone today and it keeps freezing I have to lock it than unlock it so it will act right ..I'm so upset and I waited for this phone for so long ..just hope I don't have to pay to get another one,1
"I purchased three phones each phone is in good condition, arrival time was great, received current update from apple, so far so good from three teenagers.",5
"I want to know how to have a feedback or return a product that went wrong , buy a iPhone 5c and the start button and a front camera that I do not work",2
"This has been a great cell phone. Price was reasonable and since it was unlocked, was simple to set up service with our carrier. Love the look of the phone (blue) and a good size to fit in pocket, purse, etc.",5
"Arrived in perfect condition; no problem setting up and works like it's brand new. Buying a used phone can be a scary proposition, but this seller is honest/safe.",5
I was so skeptical to buy a used phone off here BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! Not a scratch on it and works perfect! Don't buy from anyone else saved so much money and I'm very satisfied,5
The phone was brand new as advertised but it wasn't factory unlocked. I had to return it. I guess I am gonna stop buying electronic devices through amazon,3
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4
My phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. Not to mention 2 of my letters won't work when I'm typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself,2
Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don't like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one.,2
excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much.,5
You will not get a 1 yr Apple warranty with this purchase. My phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. I contacted Apple and was told it was already replaced. I contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. Horrible experience. Will never buy from this seller.,1
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use.,5

Excellent performance quality even in the middle of nowhere. It has been a great phone. We would again purchase the same item from the same seller.,5
Only had fone for about month and it was stolen. I'm out all that money. No one would do anything for me. Even a discount when I'm ready to purchase another fone. I just felt something could of been done that's a lot of money to be out,1
"This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed",3
I got my phone yesterday it looked brand new my Sims card counldnt fit in it so I took it to the store got exchange for a pink one but overall the phone look brand new no scratches,3
I was skeptical when I bought this product. It works perfectly. The seller also asked any questions that may arise after purchasing the product. Excellent quality and shipped fast. I highly recommend it,5

Great price but mine is defective for checking messages. I can't be without a phone and asked if they could send another than I would send this one back after I activated the new one but they said NO.,2
The phone has only worked properly one week. It constantly cuts off and on whether on the charger or not. The phones is now dead. I threw away packaging and good money....need to send back. Horrible!,1
Bought this phone and expected it to work but it continuously has an issue where it can't keep the time set. Every time you try to manually set the time or make it use the time zone feature the phone crashes or hangs. Very disappointed.,1
Trouble with the memory... Installed WhatsApp application and begun the trouble with the memory but well I will continue use it. I must search a memory card,3
Received it today. So far so good! Charger kinda sucks but phone works great so far. Can always replace the charger. And came with gift! (Cute phone case),4
"Very good condition.........fast comunication with the seller about the iPhone.but too bad the AT&T iPhone is still under contract so can not unlock it and I use the t mobile , so I return it",5
"Great quality, item was brand new in box as described, and was way cheaper than Apple's website. This is a great buy for anyone who doesn't want to spend a ton of money on the newest iPhone, but still wants a very good phone.",5
I expected the phone to have scuffs and scratches but the phone is PERFECT its like its brand new out of the box! But I didn't know it didn't come with a SIM card because it wasn't in the description but other than that I'm overly excited and will purchase from this buyer again!,5
"I bought two of these phones to give my kids as a gift. They arrived on time, were packaged nicely, included all the items l expected and, most importantly they work perfectly. I took them to my local AT&T store and fired them up in about 10 minutes. Simple and easy!",5
"Bought this as a replacement phone for my daughter. She needed one quick while I repair her other phone which she ran over. She loved it and it came just as described, holds its charge and perfect in every way.",5
Description said new phone. Phone had been used not hard to tell considering it came in its original packaging all dirty with finger prints all over screen not very happy was expecting new sealed phone other than that the is in very good condition but not what I was expecting,1
Awesome cellphone. It has a very fast and smooth software. The seller was great from the beginning all the way to the end. Would definitely buy from them again.,5
"Available memory is definitely more than 8GB - but less than 16, so this is weird and I can't really explain it. The phone looks and works great though, so no complaints so far (I've been using it for a month). I'm using it with T-Mobile.",5
"I would give it less than a star if I canThe phone has issues with connectivity, hearing the other caller, and few days ago I discovered that people call me and can get through, I call others and can't hear themI didn't change my service provider or my location so it is issues with the device",1
This phone looks exactly like the picture! It works great! We inserted the sims card and starting using it immediately! It works better than my 5s that I replaced!,5
I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new! Also love the case but I do use other ones. In the pics I have a sticker button and a screen protector so I can't show you the screen,5
"Got this from Doc and Roc Overstock through Amazon as a replacement for my wife's phone. Seller was awesome and super fast, device works wonderfully. No complaints, everything working perfectly.",5
The iPhone itself works like a charm! I was very pleased with my purchase. However the charger that came with the iPhone was very short and charged the phone really slow which wasn't too big of a problem being that you can get another charger for a small price. Overall I love the iPhone. Thanks!,5
"Great phone for my daughter. She still has it. Was practically new when I received it. Seller was wonderful and very helpful with some of the technical issues we had, not with the phone. Would highly recommend him.",5
"This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!!",5
"Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price.",4
"Great deal for an iPhone! We use it for our tween (and as backup for Waze and other apps) as an AT&T GoPhone. Since the case is less robust than the other iPhones, we got an Otterbox case and so far it's been working great!",5
"I have had phone for a short time and the top of the screen started to crack without me going anything. I thought I was purchasing a quality product, but I was mistaken. I have been an Amazon prime shopper for a long time and this has been my worst purchase.",1
"Brought for my Grandaughter and she loves it, still working strong.....now she want the one that works underwater, so then this phone will soon be mine....I guess I need to get updated shortly from my good ole Pantech Matrix flip phone with keypad....",5
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
"The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back.",2
"Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody!",5
"For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it.",5
The phone came within a week. The phone fit the description and it was unlocked for me to use. Phone was in great condition and will definitely order again.,5
I was happy I got a case and a charger that was in the description but I was told the phone works perfectly fine but it doesn't. The phone twitches which is beyond annoying. I don't appreciate that,1
"I was nervous about getting a used phone,but so far I have not had any problems .It works and functions every bit as good as the new iPhone I had before someone stole in hospital lobby as I was charging it!..My contract wasn't up and I couldn't afford the 500~600 for another one!",5
"I got this few days before Christmas and it came it right in time. The phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. My daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. So far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there's any concern on the phone, hopefully not.",5
"The phone is new. Everything is included in the package. However, the ICCID of the SIM was identified by AT&T as permanently disabled. So instead of being able to activate it online, I'm going to have to the nearest AT&T store an hour away.5 stars for the phone itself. 3 starts for the BS SIM card.",3
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy,1
"It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again",5
"The phone was in the condition as advertised which was ""fair"". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen",3
Absolutely Awful This seller sold me a lost or stolen phone that has a block on it. The phone appearance was great however I could not get it activated because there was a system block on the phone.beyond angry! 0stars!!!,1
"I'm not a fan of Apple anymore, I had gotten it to do Face Time with my little cousin but I was under the assumption it was an AT&T Phone I could use on Straight Talk but turned out it was a Sprint phone. If you like iPhones it's nice but I found it too small as well",1
"When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone.",1
"The description said it was in 'very good' condition, but when I actually received the phone it was in perfect condition. No nicks or scratches period. Definitely recommend.",5
Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together!,2
"Phone was in decent physical shape but the battery sucks. When I went to replace it someone had glued the battery in, some the screws were missing to the circuit boards. Now the phone freezes and restarts very often.",1
I bought this phone for my husband for his birthday. He was still using his original flip phone from 2006 prior to this. He is so glad that I got this phone. He doesn't know why he didn't change to this sooner. He found it easy to use.,5
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no?",4
The 5c is an awesome device. This device doesn't just come in black or white like all of the other iPhones. The plastic build is also good quality and feels durable.,5
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see.,4
"The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too!",4
"The phone arrived and the touch on the screen is messed up. :( It works okay sometimes but most of the time if I touch something, it reads like I touched another part of the screen and something else opens instead. Very frustrating.",1
"it has a glitch that drops wifi, and you can't simply turn it back on. shut it off, then reboot, and wifi capability returns. otherwise, it's been a good phone. it's used, after all. even a new one can have a glitch, over time.",4
"The phone was on time and no cracks, but minor wear. However, after a week it blanked out and gave me issues, it does this once every few weeks.But other than that, I do enjoy my phone.",4
"Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a ""new"" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work.",1
"The iPhone heats up & battery dies too fast & I only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don't seem like it. From internal conditions. looks great, don't work great:(",2
Purchases a used iPhone and that's what it got. Looks used with scratches on screen. I put an Otter box on it for protection but it also works to cover used look. Phone works great. Good phone for kids.,4
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage. It's simple but effective. The seller didn't fail to give good service. The iPhone 's legit and I love it!",5
"The delivery was fast, the phone is in good shape for the most part. The earphone port is broken though. My earphones can't go all the way in which is upsetting because I am that person that uses my earphones nonstop!",2
The phone arrived earlier than anticipated and it is absolutely as good as new. I am very pleased and will definitely work with this seller when my husband purchases a new phone in a few months. No complaints at all!,5
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,2
Cell phone works as expected. So far no problems with the cell phone.Had a little trouble with the charger but had no problems at all getting a replacement. Customer service was great. Will differently buy again in the future.,5
The screen was popped out. It had scratches on the back. Didn't match description. I dropped it on a soft surface and my screen was jacked. I had to pay to get it fixed.,1
Received my phone faster than expected. Just what I wanted. The phone has been working just fine. The price was right and I have enjoyed using the phone.,4
Love the phone got here on time....At first i had read it would have a few scratches but you cant even tell. Thank you love the phone...plus any questions i had they would right away answer them....,5
"Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast.",5
"Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract.",3
Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs.,5
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5
Just received my iPhone 5c used but like brand new:) working so far perfectly on WiFi only.. Will hook up with AT&T Monday.. From HandHeld Heroes as promised.. With charger.. Will be doing business with them again.. Can't say enough nice stuff about them!,5
"Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful.",1
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good.",1
"The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it.",2
The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it,1
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought.,1
"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap.",1
"I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested!",1
The phone was a gift to my grandson to replace his broken phone. It was just as described and was easy to set up. Everything migrated over very easily and completely. Phone was in very good condition,5
"I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating.",2
I had the phone for about two months and all of a sudden it starts shutting off on me and won't stay on contacted the seller and got no response. Horrible service and looks like it was put together like crap,1
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new .,2
"I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline.",1
I ordered my phone Tuesday night at almost midnight and received it today even though shipping said May 17- June 2. I use AT&T go phone and all I had to do was go into my local store for a sim card and they set it up! So pleased with this purchase,5
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol.,1
I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster.,1
"Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the ""best"" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both.",5
at this time the phone works fine. The cables were not a Apple approved charging cable and they were disabled by Itunes. Had to spend more money on a cable,3
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
"This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!!",5
"Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price.",4

"this phone gave trouble from the beginning, it kept blanking out and would not charge and whats worse was the sellers behavior, I returned it the seller sent it back still not working without even a line in an email sent to me. Very disappointing more in the seller than in the phone.",1
"After reviewing the phone and trying everything ywsteady to switch over to this phone it would not work. I ordered a new sim as well. Long story short, boh were a waste of my time and money and the phone did not come with a charger. The phone itself is in great condition, but was a waste for me.",1
Cosmetically it matched the description. It took 2 hours to get the phone activated at the Verizon store. I was worried it was not going to work. The phone keeps freezing and I have to keep resetting it to get text messages.,2
Have had the phone a couple months. Daughter dropped it on a carpeted floor from only about 3 ft away - cracked the screen. I doubt we'll be replacing it with another i5 as we hear that is a problem with them.,3
"Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great!",4
"There have been a few quirks now and again but a solid tool, especially for those of us who are curious about a lot of things and need to be looking things up.",4
"iphone came in original Apple packaging and in only two days with standard shipping. Works with Verizon just like the ad says. New condition, no scuffs or anything. Thanks!",5
"I already had an Iphone 5C but it only had 8GB of storage. I needed much more. I ordered this phone, it came earlier than expected. It was fully functional and had no problems. It also looks brand new. I've owned this now for a few months and everything is working fine. It offers plenty of storage. It was a good deal for the price.",5
"After one month, a chip on the logic board failed which controlled recharging the battery. Not Repairable. Had to purchase a new phone. I could have exchanged the phone with Apple for Ver5, but chose to upgrade to 6S and get a new phone.",1
"Awesome first phone for my 9 yr old. Not too $$$ that if he loses it or breaks it, it will break my bank and the ease of iOS for him is good. Pretty study as well for his needs. Battery life is really good on these.",5
"Exactly what I was looking for! My daughter wanted an iPhone for her birthday and I didn't want to spend a fortune and this was just what I wanted! The condition was nearly perfect, it came quickly and it was exactly as promised!",5
"Just as described. Due to my mistake, I had to send it back. I ordered the Iphone 6. Best value I could find. Great customer support. Wonderful to work with.",5
"DO NOT BUY. When i purchased this phone it was sold to me as a NEW phone, not refurbished. It is clear now that the phone WAS refurbished and the battery only lasted a few month.",1
"When I received it, it didn't come with SIM card and the speaker in the phone didn't work, so I couldn't hear anything. It also wouldn't make a call. The phone looked in new condition, but unfortunately didn't work. But I returned it with no questions asked and the process was very easy.",1
"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile.",5
"I have bought before this one had a few small issues such as the ""P"" button not working when upright, but It is still worth the cost to me and beats the heck out of ATT.",4
"The product was in good condition, definitely what I needed, but it did not come in the original box as stated and neither did it come with the head phones but all that can be over looked since the phone was my main focus of the purchase.",3
"The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition. When I received it there were scratches on it, the screen pops up in one corner, and all the accessories were fake with a mispelled word on it. I was very disappointed with this product.",2
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
"I was verrrry leary ordering this phone thinking that it probably would not work and so on. Thank god Amazon has a great return policy! Turns out, the phone looked brand new!!! Arrived fast and phone works flawlessly. The phone I ordered was unlocked and I was able to put in international SIM card and works great!",5
"I purchased this phone from cellcow through Amazon. The phone was a piece of junk. It acts possessed, randomly switching screens and typing without my even touching it. Save your money!",1
This phone is stuck in the year 1970 and when I try to change the year it just keeps skipping over all of them.. and then the screen wouldn't work when I plugged it in with the charger.. really hope this can be a quick fix otherwise I'll be very disappointed...waste of my money I guess.,3
It worked great for about a month and now every time I call someone my phone will mute me with out even touching it. When I go to unmute the call it locks me out. The screen will go black for no reason and it won't lock. To make the screen not black anymore I have to hit the middle button even if I'm on the home page.,2
"Came in great condition. No SIM included and the information booklet was missing, as well as a few dints. However this was as expected so overall I am stoked!",4
These things are extremely brittle. If you were to purchase one I would highly suggest investing in a heavy duty case. I literally have gone through 4 in the last year and I treat it very carefully.Otherwise a nice piece of technology.,3
The iPhone 5c I received is great. The charger and USB cable that came with it have issues. By trial and error I determined the charger barely works. The USB cable has a very small break in it at the edge where it connects with the phone port. It's a disappointment that I have to replace these items immediately.,4
"This phone was NOT compatible with the Verizon network. I had to get a new phone and pay just as much for it. TERRIBLE marketing, don't believe it when it says it is verizon compatible.",1
Was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Replaced a first gen droid so there was no place to go but up.The phone came in a plain white box with charging cable. It looked brand new and unused.So far it has performed as a new phone with no troubles whatsoever.,5
"Moving from Android to Apple...my kids have this phone too and keep me straight on using it. Phone is superb and, while Apple has its moments, it is intuitive to use. Seller was VERY responsive...only reason not a 5 star is ""new"" phone had been opened for imei verification. Not sure that's industry standard. If it is, seller is 5 star.",4
"It is compatible with Verizon. Not pink but PEACH, pretty beaten up...but not bad enough to return. A descent value for anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune on a phone!",4
"The discription reads that it is a Verizon Wireless phone. However, I did not receive a Verizon phone like promised and was unable to use it. It is also a phone of much lesser value if you try to sell it.",1
Bought this phone a couple of weeks ago and the phone will not hold a charge. Have to take it to an Apple store to have it repaired. Very unhappy about this.,1
"I usually don't complain if something isn't too bad messed up, but this phone came with a really bad crack in the screen and a slight crack in the bottom. The back is also badly scrapped up! It didn't even come with a charger!",1
nice price for phone but the motherboard of the phone sticks and i cant text or do anything with the phone. i thought i wait it out to see what else can be done for the phone nothing,1
Very satisfied with the quality. This was the first time I'd bought a used phone and I'm very satisfied. The return policy and pictures made me feel better about ordering and I'm likely to do this again in the future.,5
works great! was able to take it to veroson and have it activated. Daughter loves it as a replacement for her phone that was stolen. Company answered questions and we received it on time.,5
"Ad stated in mint condition except minor damage on the corner. That was accurate, however, a few of the keys don't work and this was a graduation gift for my son. Very disappointed.",3
This shipped so fast and my son was so excited to receive it earlier than expected. Great condition phone and well worth the money. Thanks for the quality product and fast shipping - it truly made his day!,5
This phone is advertised as Verizon.. it DOES NOT work with Verizon accounts! Huge waste of time and money and had to be returned. Don't waste your time.,1
"Great phone replacement for our other phone. Shipped fast and for a used phone, it works perfectly and there weren't as many defects on the phone as described. It was better.",5
"Delivery was great, but the phone didn't make it to the new year. Completely blacked out screen with no previous damage done. Bout to head to dinner and no screen, no way to call out, text nothing. Owned the phone apx 4months...",2
Honestly freaked me out a little because it did not come with a sim card but I should'nt have expected that anyways. The seller gave nice institutions on what to do about getting a sim card and activating the phone. My phone is now activated and i am very happy!,5
"Came exactly as described. Needed a back up phone...wasn't sure about purchasing used iPhone...but so far, so good. Works just like my iPhone 6...flawless.",5
LOOKED AND WORKS AS I HOPED FOR WITH A REFURBISHED PHONE. SELLER ANSWERED ALL MY QUESTIONS AND WE GOT THE PHONE QUICKLY THROUGH MAIL. I AM PLEASED AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SELLER :),5
"I was really excited about this phone that is why i was willing to pay extra for it. The only down side is when it is charging it malfunctions if you try to use it while charging. The sender put way too much tape on the case, but all & all pretty happy with my phone.",4
"The speaker did not work. I had to trade it to Verizon for $43 because my 11 year old son had been waiting to activate it. We took it in to activate it and it didn't work so I had to buy one at Verizon so as not to disappoint my son on his birthday, He brought his grades up to earn it. I was out $60 and got a phone contract I did not want.",1
"The phone works fine but it is more scratched up than anticipated. Also, both the charging cable and the wall plug that were sent with the phone did not work at all..",2
Received as advertised: Verizon Wireless Apple iPhone 5c. Took it to the Verizon store and had them insert a SIM card and it works great. No complaints.,5
"Received phone on time and it was ready to be connected to Verizon.UPDATED: 4 months after I got the phone the screen stopped working. No touch screen. It was obvious when I recieved it that the screen had been replaced, I'm guessing it was cheaply done. Do not recommend.",1
"The phone looks like it was brand new, everything works perfect, no dents, no scratches. The shipping was really fast, arrived before time (USPS). also it's great that it's unlocked, it works perfect with my Mexican carrier (telcel), and I'm pretty sure I won't have problems using it in the US with t-mobile.",5
"Came in great condition, the only down side was the wall charger that came with it fell apart after about 2 weeks of use. But the phone its self works great!",4
Phone was sold under Verizon as the carrier. when I called Verizon to activate the device they said the IME # was not a Verizon phone and would not activate the phone.,1
The phone seems to work well so far. But it was not a Verizon phone as advertised. I had to go with the less reliable AT&T network to make use of the phone.,3
"I did not receive a ""Verizon Wireless"" phone, rather an unlocked iPhone. The difference being that Verizon uses CDMA and unlocked iPhones only work with GSM networks like AT&T. In short, the phone will never work on the Verizon network and was a huge waste of my time and money.",1
Not only was the phone a great price but even more than that was the person that sold it to me. I will never forget her kindness and caring. Probably one of the best experiences I have ever had on any online store,5
This phone sucks. It says its a Verizon phone but it doesn't work with verizon. I took it to the Verizon store and it wasn't in their system. I don't know why there are any good reviews.,1
"The phone is great and Technomaster is the best supplier I have had the opportunity to work with , he is fast responsive and will do the best to satisfy his customers .",5
"Having a few ongoing issues with phone. Sound doesn't work at times. Jumps from one app to another. Glitches frequently while charging. Overall, I regret the purchase.",2
"I was sold a phone that was defective and would not work with the Verizon Wireless network. So I'm not giving the phone a review, just the people I bought it from. I spent over 2 hours in the Verizon Store with them trying to activate it. With them finally telling me it is defective.Awful.",1
"The microphone doesn't work that well, and the time wont stay the same its constantly changing. So I've had to keep my old POS phone around just for the time. Trying to work something out to fix this. But over all it was in good looking condition havent quite came along any other problems, just hoping these are easy fixes!",3
"The phone came just as expected! It was advertised as new and it was! No hassle trying to activate it, I just switched the SIM card to this one and boom, done. I love the cute pink color and appreciate the affordable quality of the phone while still being updated technology! :)",5
The phone I purchased was listed as a new Verizon phone. My local dealer and Verizon corporate could not activate because according to the MEID it wasn't a Verizon phone. I am displeased with having to go through the hassle of returning the phone.,1
Returned it because the speaker didn't work which the seller didn't realize and was apologetic about but other than that it was as described and in good working order,4
"Love this phone! I had the 6 for a whole 2 days before dropping it in the toilet and destroying it, yeah insurance would've been a good investment. Call me cheap. Now I get to pay Verizon for 2 years and had to buy a phone besides! Call me stupid. It's a good phone, a basic version of the 6. Works for me.",5
Not happy. This phone only lasted 6 months we took it to Verizon to be checked. They did test on it to see if it got wet or if the screen was cracked. It freezes up and gets lines on the screen. We can receive texts but can't send. I think we got a lemon,1
This phone sucks. It says its a Verizon phone but it doesn't work with verizon. I took it to the Verizon store and it wasn't in their system. I don't know why there are any good reviews.,1
"The phone is great and Technomaster is the best supplier I have had the opportunity to work with , he is fast responsive and will do the best to satisfy his customers .",5
"Had product for 4 months and it stopped working. No wear and tear, The product just won't turn on and the company who I purchased it from won't replace item.",1
"Has some sort of virus--if you leave it sitting on the table, it will begin to randomly punch in numbers at random intervals. Will return it as soon as I get some free time...",1
The speaker to hearing is busted and that was not mentioned in the description. It is really tough to hear sound through speaker phone and while on the phone with others. Looked inside and it appeared to be damaged.Wishing I would have known this before buying.,3
The phone is great but have taken it to two verixon stores and they say it is not verizon compatible. We have purchased a verizon sim card that appears to work correctly. Please advise.Thank you.J chobotiuk,3
It clearly was posted as a Verizon Wireless IPhone 5. It did not work at all. Verizon Wireless did not recognize the ID at all. Returning the phone for a full refund. It was a gift for my daughter.,1
Ordered the 16GB but they actually ran out of it and instead of canceling the order they upgraded it to the 32GB for no extra cost. I loved it but my girlfriend really loved it as a gift!,5
"Very nice mobile. Great screen, smooth performance, elegant style and clear graphics.I love the high quality this device has although I was initially worried about the plastic back for the first time in an iPhone.I would highly recommend it and I would love to see how the 5S is like since it is even better.",5
I order this phone as a gift for my niece. I was really unsure to get this on Amazon because I never got an iPhone other than the Apple Store but ended up being a good experience. This is my review:1. Works good.2. The outside conditions are 9/10.3. Software ok!4. Fast delivery5. Headphones and charger works perfect,5
"The phone had issues.first of all the upper part of the screen is discolored. When using earphones and charging or when using phone as a car ipod, the phone begins to make a loud deafening sound . The phone camera freezes too. All these continue until there's a restart of the phone. Which means you have to wait longer",2
IPhone 5c is extremely slow on current iOS. If I take about 30 Pictures and couple of videos the storage is full. It was a mistake buying an 8GB phone.,1
Only had fone for about month and it was stolen. I'm out all that money. No one would do anything for me. Even a discount when I'm ready to purchase another fone. I just felt something could of been done that's a lot of money to be out,1
"This phone was a great price, and works as intended. i have always been and android user, this is my first IPhone and it works great. i also love the color.",4
"Awesome!!!It had a couple of scuff marks along the edges but other than that I was very pleasantly surprised. It was very affordable, ecspecially for a 14 year old with a small job...so happy....",5
"Interestingly, the phone actually came with a Verizon simcard though it claims it will not work with Verizon. My from the big apple is model A1532 which is prossibly an verizon unlocked version. I tested it with my H2O prepaid card and it works well though. Hope this help.",4
"i bought this product and i choose the option ''new'' now it results its refubrished. it doesnt have warranty anymore, i bought it 4 months ago. What can i do if a need the warranty now. i need an answer",1
"Purchased this for my mom. She loves it.. came when promised. Arrived in immaculate condition. Flawless.. unlocked as promised, everything works no issues, for $150 best iphone 5 u will get. . Charger included. No complaints",5
"This product came earlier than the expected date. Mines were as cheap as 85 dollars , the only difficult is that i needed a sim card to activate my Phone luckily my cousin was there to let me borrow hers . phone came perfectly no scratches or nothing , a charger came with it so i recommend any body to purchase from this seller",5
I was worried at first considering the low price but I'm very happy with the my 5c it had very very small scratches and I was able to put an ATT sim in before switching to cricket wireless.no problems.5 stars all day.,5
"The seller is very trustworthy, I received the phone safe and sound with no issues on it except that whenever there's pressure on a certain area of the phone screen the screen will kind of go in and out. Very minor detail and doesn't affect phone at all, it just shows that the phone has had its screen replaced before selling.",4
"Initially had some issues with the phone not being unlocked, seller contacted me and rectified the situation. Phone works great and I am very happy with the product, especially the customer service.",5
"Scam! When I was buying it, it was a sim card, not iPhone! It costed 1 cent and didn't worked. They did it to get reviewes and now are changing description. What a shame!",1
"the phone arrived as described in great condition. it was ready to go to a sprint store and get signed up for a sprint account, etc. I'm using it and loving it! no issues with getting a sim card, etc.",5
The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping.,1
"This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed",3
I got my phone yesterday it looked brand new my Sims card counldnt fit in it so I took it to the store got exchange for a pink one but overall the phone look brand new no scratches,3
"It came very fast, cute phone and of course amazing Apple quality, the only weird thing is that even the phone was new, it came with a sim card inside of the phone...",4
"Phone was NOT NEW as described. Phone stopped working after 8 months. When I took it to the Apple store they told me my phone was a ""Franken-Phone"" made up of parts from many old phones. Apple will not repair it and I seriously doubt I will see my money again. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!",1
"Might be unlucky because this phone itself is unfuctional. It doesn't open half the time when I click the power or home button, sometimes I even flick the mute button for it to work but it doesn't. It only opens when I recieve a call",1
I'm wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound...,1
"Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.",2
"8GB iPhone is USELESS. iOS takes up nearly /2 the storage -- the device is maxed out after few pictures, songs and chats. DON'T BUY AN 8GB IPHONE!!! Expensive lesson learned.",1
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I was so worried that it would not be what we expected it to be per online pics, but it was! My 2nd worry was whether or not I could get it activated with Metro PCS and of course I was! MY DAUGHTER HAS NO COMPLAINTS>>What u see is what you get! Love It!",5
Great phone! Down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. Learned this the hard way. I'm an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. Spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must.,5
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4
The phone looked like it went through a blender. Deep scratches all over the blue part. Turned the phone on and there was nothing but a line down the side of it. Returned for refund.,1
This was an amazing buy. I was very skeptical considering that its risky to buy a used phone.The phone is exactly as it was advertised. Shipped fast.Its been more than 3 months now and never experienced any issues.,5
Got my phone a little while ago and had a little bit of trouble with getting it over and working on Metro PCS . But I got it and am finally #teamiphone !,5
Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don't like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one.,2
excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much.,5
You will not get a 1 yr Apple warranty with this purchase. My phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. I contacted Apple and was told it was already replaced. I contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. Horrible experience. Will never buy from this seller.,1
I ended up taking the phone to Walmart and asked them if they could activate it. The employee inserted a new SIM card in it and activated it thru their Straight Talk wireless. When the only carrier in my small town couldn't or either wouldn't do it. Now it works fine! Will not be sending it back after all.,4
"the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used",2
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use.,5
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition.,3
"I ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, I got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. I'm thinking about returning it, but I can't go without a phone for long and I'm not sure how long it'll take for them to get me the right one. I'm bummed out.",1
"Not even 4 months into owning this phone has it stopped working, well I have no screen. I am getting texts and calls, I just can't respond to them. Not pleased at all!!!!!!",1
I just got my phone today and it keeps freezing I have to lock it than unlock it so it will act right ..I'm so upset and I waited for this phone for so long ..just hope I don't have to pay to get another one,1
"I purchased three phones each phone is in good condition, arrival time was great, received current update from apple, so far so good from three teenagers.",5
"Purchased for my daughter for t mobile prepaid service. Had to purchase a micro sim card from tmobile and phone worked perfectly. Phone did not come in the standard iphone white box I'm used to, but upon opening it phone looked new and had all the plastic coverings a new phone should have.",5
"Got a great price for iphone 5c. Was delivered in two days, brand new as advertised and my daughter loves it. It works great with AT&T and I get to keep the same plan without having to do the AT&T upgrade for my daughter which is even better deal.",5
"In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You'd never know this phone wasn't brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!!",5
I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it,1
"I bought Apple I Phone for my mom as a gift, unfortunately it didn't work. I contact seller and I receive refund. I am very happy with customer service. I have never had so nice and understanding service.",4
"Flawless Phone!!! A+++++ besides it being practically new I got it real quick and took 2 minutes to activate with my carrier! Will do business again in a heartbeat! Thanks ""CELLAS""",5
"iphone was indeed unlocked. there was a slight misfit with my charger, but it was promptly replaced by the seller. phone looks good. needs a nano sim - you will need to buy your own for a buck, typically. absolutely new",5
This phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn't go through. I can't return because window has been closed. Apple won't replace because I didn't purchase from them. I'm out $300. I recommend you do not buy!,1
Thank goodness the phone worked. However the earphones were not the original apple earphones; they looked very cheap and you can tell they aren't from apple.,2
"This is my first iphone ever and I'm 100% satisfied. This iPhone 5c came earlier than it was supposed to arrive, looking brand new, unlocked, with 3 chargers, screen cases, headphones (not regular iPhone headphones though). All in all, I'm a happy camper.",5
Nice looking phone as usual buy Apple just screwed me up yet again with the phone memory it said it was 8gb and turned out to be 5.4 to be precise. Why do they keep shoving us up all their stupid apps that No one ever uses,1
My phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. Not to mention 2 of my letters won't work when I'm typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself,2
The phone is beautiful work lovely and no scratches All I have to do is put my Sim card and turn it on and goes work right away I Gave this a five-star cousin I have no problem with it,5
This phone works just fine and as described by the seller. There was not a scratch on it when I received it. I am very satisfied with this phone and would buy from this seller again.,4
"ordered it and it came on time, nothing wrong with the phone. it only cost $15 for a sim card to activate your phone or switch phones (same carrier). truly decent.((my carrier is t-mobile))",5
I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far. Otherwise its a decent iPhone and arrived on time through Amazon Prime which is a terrific service,3
I was so skeptical to buy a used phone off here BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! Not a scratch on it and works perfect! Don't buy from anyone else saved so much money and I'm very satisfied,5
"This was a nightmare. The phone was not unlocked, and it took me forever to try to activate it. Then I found out it was because the phone was reported as STOLEN. I had to send it back and purchase a different phone. Never again will I buy a phone online",1
"It came in excellent condition, runs very good, only sidenote would be a slight scuff on the Sim card tray but other than that very good phone 10/10 would recommend",4
"The screen had a sort of smudge in the center. We bought the telephone for testing, so we can live with that. But is a defect that wasn't advertised and in my opinion that's not ""very good"" quality.",2
"Do not buy this phone. It is USELESS I REPEAT IT IS USELESS. The screen does not work. These people sell BASURAR on amazon. I don't know y amazon grants them the permission to sell cheap, useless and garbage product on their site.",1
Phone was listed as like new but when we tried to activate it the camera didn't work and you could make a call but the person you were calling couldn't hear you,1
"No problem getting this phone turn on by metro pcs. Works great and my daughter loved it for her birthday. Also, came in the date I was suppose to receive it by.",5
"I'm Having problems receiving calls with this phone...the calls go straight to the voice mail. not every single call though, some friends say that they had to call twice or three times to reach me...I get notifications for missed calls and I can see who called me, but still it's a frustrating problem to have!",1
"In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You'd never know this phone wasn't brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!!",5
"I got this phone day before yesterday. Arrived on time. The phone was sealed and is brand new. Loved it. I bought it for my mother in India. So, I will have to take it to India and check if it works with the service providers there. It should, hopefully. :)",5
"I want to know how to have a feedback or return a product that went wrong , buy a iPhone 5c and the start button and a front camera that I do not work",2
"This has been a great cell phone. Price was reasonable and since it was unlocked, was simple to set up service with our carrier. Love the look of the phone (blue) and a good size to fit in pocket, purse, etc.",5
"Arrived in perfect condition; no problem setting up and works like it's brand new. Buying a used phone can be a scary proposition, but this seller is honest/safe.",5
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol.,1
"Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody!",5
"For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it.",5
The phone came within a week. The phone fit the description and it was unlocked for me to use. Phone was in great condition and will definitely order again.,5
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage. It's simple but effective. The seller didn't fail to give good service. The iPhone 's legit and I love it!",5
at this time the phone works fine. The cables were not a Apple approved charging cable and they were disabled by Itunes. Had to spend more money on a cable,3
"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5
Just received my iPhone 5c used but like brand new:) working so far perfectly on WiFi only.. Will hook up with AT&T Monday.. From HandHeld Heroes as promised.. With charger.. Will be doing business with them again.. Can't say enough nice stuff about them!,5
"Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful.",1
"I got this few days before Christmas and it came it right in time. The phone is nice and hardly any scratch or ding. My daughter loves it and she enjoy using it. So far everything lo0ks go0d, will update if there's any concern on the phone, hopefully not.",5
"The phone is new. Everything is included in the package. However, the ICCID of the SIM was identified by AT&T as permanently disabled. So instead of being able to activate it online, I'm going to have to the nearest AT&T store an hour away.5 stars for the phone itself. 3 starts for the BS SIM card.",3
I have owned a lot of refurbished phones and have never had problems. For the first few days the phone seemed fine and for the last week it only works sometimes it either always says no service or no sim card. very unhappy,1
"Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast.",5
"Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract.",3
Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs.,5
"The phone came in, and I thought it was okay, but the phone turns off randomly and doesn't turn back on until I plug it in, even if it has charge. I have contacted the seller, and have to wait two business days to hear back.",2
"This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no?",4
The 5c is an awesome device. This device doesn't just come in black or white like all of the other iPhones. The plastic build is also good quality and feels durable.,5
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see.,4
"The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too!",4
Purchases a used iPhone and that's what it got. Looks used with scratches on screen. I put an Otter box on it for protection but it also works to cover used look. Phone works great. Good phone for kids.,4
"when I bought the phone, I had cracked the screen within a week of having it so I went to get it repaired and the tech employee said some plates and screws were missing. After a few weeks, the actual screen is coming loose and falling out sometimes... This could be a manufacturer malfunction but this iPhone is not good.",1
"The description of the cosmetics of the phone was very accurate. However the phone didn't work the way it should have so that was a disappointment, we returned it.",2
"This was a gift for my father who took his last phone for a swin. I was a little worried that everything would work, but it was delivered quickly and he was able to get it set up right away. It was a hit!!!",5
"Phone works well, no problems does exactly what a 5c apple phone should do. I have phone for months now. No scratches no marks on phone, came with a wall charger & great bargin price.",4
"Great deal for an iPhone! We use it for our tween (and as backup for Waze and other apps) as an AT&T GoPhone. Since the case is less robust than the other iPhones, we got an Otterbox case and so far it's been working great!",5
"I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating.",2
"Great phone for my daughter. She still has it. Was practically new when I received it. Seller was wonderful and very helpful with some of the technical issues we had, not with the phone. Would highly recommend him.",5
"The phone arrived and the touch on the screen is messed up. :( It works okay sometimes but most of the time if I touch something, it reads like I touched another part of the screen and something else opens instead. Very frustrating.",1
"it has a glitch that drops wifi, and you can't simply turn it back on. shut it off, then reboot, and wifi capability returns. otherwise, it's been a good phone. it's used, after all. even a new one can have a glitch, over time.",4
"The phone was on time and no cracks, but minor wear. However, after a week it blanked out and gave me issues, it does this once every few weeks.But other than that, I do enjoy my phone.",4
"Unfortunately our phone started to have issues after only 2 weeks of turning the phone on so I'm not sure it was a ""new"" phone as advertised. The camera,video do not work.",1
"The iPhone heats up & battery dies too fast & I only had it for 2 weeks, supposed to be new but it don't seem like it. From internal conditions. looks great, don't work great:(",2
I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster.,1
"Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the ""best"" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both.",5
"Phone was in decent physical shape but the battery sucks. When I went to replace it someone had glued the battery in, some the screws were missing to the circuit boards. Now the phone freezes and restarts very often.",1
I was happy I got a case and a charger that was in the description but I was told the phone works perfectly fine but it doesn't. The phone twitches which is beyond annoying. I don't appreciate that,1
"I was nervous about getting a used phone,but so far I have not had any problems .It works and functions every bit as good as the new iPhone I had before someone stole in hospital lobby as I was charging it!..My contract wasn't up and I couldn't afford the 500~600 for another one!",5
"The description said it was in 'very good' condition, but when I actually received the phone it was in perfect condition. No nicks or scratches period. Definitely recommend.",5
Gave 3 stars because it did not come with a charger or box. The battery was already half way gone. When I first turned it on I thought it was broke the screen clarity was off. I think it's not worth that much and it doesn't come with the needed accessories. No sim card as well...i could've just brought a new phone all together!,2
Q I have to show I am not satisfied with the quality of the charger and headphones ARE APPLE original porq not shoddy . The phone whether it is good and looks completely new .,2
"I purchased this phone in May. By August, the battery was shot and could not hold a charge. The seller would not help me because it has been over 60 days. So now I'm stuck with this phone that constantly has to be plugged in. I might as well have a landline.",1
"I have had phone for a short time and the top of the screen started to crack without me going anything. I thought I was purchasing a quality product, but I was mistaken. I have been an Amazon prime shopper for a long time and this has been my worst purchase.",1
"Brought for my Grandaughter and she loves it, still working strong.....now she want the one that works underwater, so then this phone will soon be mine....I guess I need to get updated shortly from my good ole Pantech Matrix flip phone with keypad....",5
I ordered my phone Tuesday night at almost midnight and received it today even though shipping said May 17- June 2. I use AT&T go phone and all I had to do was go into my local store for a sim card and they set it up! So pleased with this purchase,5
"It was exactly what I wanted and what it said it was, few very minor scuffs but basically brand new and works perfectly so far.. The company it came from was nice to put two chargers and a set of earbuds in with it, made a really good impression on me to go to them again",5
"The phone was in the condition as advertised which was ""fair"". I felt that the scratches on the case made the condition fair. but the phone was very dirty. but once cleaned up it was good to go. there were no scratches on the screen",3
Absolutely Awful This seller sold me a lost or stolen phone that has a block on it. The phone appearance was great however I could not get it activated because there was a system block on the phone.beyond angry! 0stars!!!,1
"I'm not a fan of Apple anymore, I had gotten it to do Face Time with my little cousin but I was under the assumption it was an AT&T Phone I could use on Straight Talk but turned out it was a Sprint phone. If you like iPhones it's nice but I found it too small as well",1
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1
"Amazing! Got an iPhone 5c that looks like a brand new phone! We had one small issue with the charger, but customer service was awesome and got the problem taken care of immediately. They were very nice and beyond helpful. This is the second phone we have gotten and they have both been amazing! Would definitely reccommend this to anybody!",5
"For an used phone I give this a great review. It just had one small scratch by the speaker, but that was it. No major scratches on the screen or back. It can a little dirty, but it wiped right off. Overall, I'm very pleased with how good of a condition the used iPhone 5c was when I got it.",5
The phone came within a week. The phone fit the description and it was unlocked for me to use. Phone was in great condition and will definitely order again.,5
I bought this phone for my husband for his birthday. He was still using his original flip phone from 2006 prior to this. He is so glad that I got this phone. He doesn't know why he didn't change to this sooner. He found it easy to use.,5
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,2
Cell phone works as expected. So far no problems with the cell phone.Had a little trouble with the charger but had no problems at all getting a replacement. Customer service was great. Will differently buy again in the future.,5
I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new! Also love the case but I do use other ones. In the pics I have a sticker button and a screen protector so I can't show you the screen,5
"Got this from Doc and Roc Overstock through Amazon as a replacement for my wife's phone. Seller was awesome and super fast, device works wonderfully. No complaints, everything working perfectly.",5
The iPhone itself works like a charm! I was very pleased with my purchase. However the charger that came with the iPhone was very short and charged the phone really slow which wasn't too big of a problem being that you can get another charger for a small price. Overall I love the iPhone. Thanks!,5
"I love it so far. Only problem I found out so far is the phone will shut down sometimes even if I have battery left. I never used iphone before and I really like it so far. It is light and thin, fast and I love the siri system.",5
"Phone was dirty, there was sticky stuff all over it. Did not come with charger or little tool to open SIM card port. Screen is also not pushed in at the top.",3
Got it for my sister because she needed a new phone. Her iPhone 4 had lag especially on iOS 7. It made me cry how slow her phone was. The iPhone 5C was a perfect replacement. Fast and reliable. She runs up the bill like crazy now.!!,5
"It came perfectly fine with the charger and everything but I expected it to be unlocked. When I got it, and tried to take it to a phone service company, they said it wasn't unlocked so...yeah....good overall though. Works great.",3
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage. It's simple but effective. The seller didn't fail to give good service. The iPhone 's legit and I love it!",5

I ordered an unlocked phone for my son for christmas but unfortunately he cannot use it as it is blocked. We are both very disappointed and unsatisfied. I ordered several times from Amazon and never had any problems. And suddenly my two last orders were a disaster.,1
"Fantastic seller, smoking fast shipping. I wish everyone did business this way!! This may not be the ""best"" Apple phone but it is amazing. I still like Microsoft based phones and there are pros and cons to both.",5
"This phone was just as I was wishing for, but one slight problem (worry). It has a sim card of AT&T and it has unlimited text, call, and 4G LTE data. So if I use those will I get charged or no?",4
The 5c is an awesome device. This device doesn't just come in black or white like all of the other iPhones. The plastic build is also good quality and feels durable.,5
IOS 7 is great. This phone is for my wife and she likes the simplicity and didn't like all the options in Android. The one issue I have with the iPhone in general is not everyone is 21 with sharp eyes and text and some menus are really hard to see.,4
"The phone came relatively quickly and has been working great this far (3months)However the cord that came with it doesn't work any longer and I will need to go buy one, also never came with an adapter so that was an additional expense. other than that my daughter loves her phone and I think I want one too!",4

"Phone came in decent condition, however, came with a battery problem. Phone would not charge, so I replaced the battery, which was an unconvienent expense.",2
"I was pretty skeptical once I read some of these reviews. My phone got here with only one or two small scratches & the only complaint I have is that when charging, my screen doesn't act right when I try to use my phone so I have to unplug it, do the task, then plug it back in. I love my phone though, I'd still recommend buying it.",4
My phone is perfect it was easy to transfer all my info from my old phone. The phone is in perfect condition now all I gotta do is find the perfect case I love my new phone,5
I received this phone before I was told out would be here. Super happy about that. Pricing was fair. The only downside is that it didn't come with any kind of manual. Had to Google some things.,4
The seller has nothing to do with the shotty craftsmanship of this phone. Screen/phone popped apart in my purse and it just wasn't the same after. Buy a better iPhone lol.,1
"Phone is a Christmas present for grand daughter who really wants one but can't get it for herself. I think she will really love it. Price was right, packing secure, and delivery fast.",5
"Phone is great, as seller promised was in perfect condition. 3 stard because I attempted to use two different services to unlock the phone and was denied. AT&T will not unlock the phone if the phone is still considered under contract.",3
Great Phone For A Great Price !!! Love the features on this new system. Great to have an Iphone again. I dont think they are overated like everyone says. I think that Andriod id full of too many advertisments and seems kinda unsafe when downloading programs.,5
Received a stolen phone.😡 Found out when trying to activate with AT&T. Opened a claim with Amazon to get a refund and determine what to do with Stolen phone. Not happy to say the least.,1

The phone came with dirt in the ports and buttons from use they didnt even bother cleaning it before selling it. Additionally the charger and cable they provided were cheap genetics. The charger is so cheap it takes for ever to charge the phone on it,1
I love the phone nothing wrong with it at all it said scratches on the screen I think but I don't see none but if they are I can't see them in the light the gloss is flawless on the back the phone is pretty much new!

I haven't had this phone a week yet and I have lines going horizontal and vertical all over my screen. Also the home button doesn't work half the time. I am going to have to buy another phone to replace this one I just bought.,1
"This is a sham. I ordered a new one and the piece of junk I got was such a waste of money. It can't tell time for one, it's always the same time, 7:49. Secondly, Bluetooth doesn't work! Along with a series of errors this phone is a piece of crap.",1
"I was promised a good working phone but apparently when i got it, the microphone doesn't work. When i make phone calls, record voice memos or videos, the sound just doesnt come through. Really disappointed! Phone should have been properly tested!",1
The phone was a gift to my grandson to replace his broken phone. It was just as described and was easy to set up. Everything migrated over very easily and completely. Phone was in very good condition,5
"Received it in 4 days. Refurbished to appear brand new, works perfectly, came with case, screen protector and charger. All for less than half the regular price!",5
It's a great phone but the main problem is: as soon as I lock the screen it loses track of time. That would've been nice to know before I bought the phone!,2

I had the phone for about two months and all of a sudden it starts shutting off on me and won't stay on contacted the seller and got no response. Horrible service and looks like it was put together like crap,1

"the phone is in good condition with wear and tear, but the phone its self is not. it gets super hot and there are parts of the screen that dont work correctly. for a used iphone 5c this should not be happening for that price... i am not satisfied what so ever.",2
"The delivery was fast, the phone is in good shape for the most part. The earphone port is broken though. My earphones can't go all the way in which is upsetting because I am that person that uses my earphones nonstop!",2
The phone arrived earlier than anticipated and it is absolutely as good as new. I am very pleased and will definitely work with this seller when my husband purchases a new phone in a few months. No complaints at all!,5
"I purchased this phone in October (2015). Since then, I have had issues with freezing, lack of responsiveness (especially from my keyboard), the home button not working, and now it won't charge. I have a few friends who also have this phone and they have had issues as well. I would consider my use average, so this is very frustrating.",2
"When I got the phone it wouldn't charge all the time. And the. My mother took it on her vacation since she was going abroad and my plan allowed that with my phone. Well, I wouldn't charge over there or in America. I went to the Apple Store and they couldn't even get it to charge. Ended up having to get it replaced with a new iPhone.",1
"I was nervous about buying a used iPhone online, but when I received this there wasn't a scratch on it! It looked brand new. Placed my SIM card , charged it and it works great!!! Very happy customer!",5
Just received my iPhone 5c used but like brand new:) working so far perfectly on WiFi only.. Will hook up with AT&T Monday.. From HandHeld Heroes as promised.. With charger.. Will be doing business with them again.. Can't say enough nice stuff about them!,5
"Was NOT AT&T carrier. It was actually sprint. Failed to mention the giant gash in the bottom corner, and the fact it came with no headphones. Also it was still registered to another user. Just awful.",1
"This was the only place I could find the 32 gb version. I made the switch from a Samsung S6 since I didn't really need all the customization. Plus, this phone is perfect for one hand usage.

Phone in excellent. New shape.Issues: 1. charger is not working. Heats up fast. 2. When switching to silent mode from side. Makes a loud vibrating sound when switched on.,4
The iPhone 5c in blue the chargers port won't hold the charges. So that why I return the iPhone 5c. You guys need to check all phones before shipping it.,2
"It looks really great - I haven't Given it to my son because it's a gift for my for Christmas so I'll let you know them, but it looks fine and packaged nicely. Thank You - he will be using it as an I pod everything but a telephone because he's only nine",5
this phone have bad quality the sound barley works the screen blanked out after the first day of having it I do not recommend anyone to order this phone.,1

Overall this phone is not for me. It has a few great features though. Way to expensive for what you get.It is too small for me and I don't like not being able to delete the apps I do not use.I suggest watching the videos on youtube before you buy one.,2
excellent! it works perfectly fine and is exactly what we reed on the descrption. thanks for your honesty. Is in the best conditions. The deliver was on time. Nothing bad to say. Thank you very much.,5
You will not get a 1 yr Apple warranty with this purchase. My phone stopped working in 6 months with no damage to it. I contacted Apple and was told it was already replaced. I contacted the seller for refund and he just closed my request. Horrible experience. Will never buy from this seller.,1
"The phone works great!!! Although, a few days after I received the phone, the charger that came with it stopped working. I was sent a new charger and it charges my phone very slowly. I let them know again and they are sending me another charger. They help solve their customers problems and I highly recommend you buy their products. HAPPY BUYING (:",5
"Perfect all the way around but if you are a big music fan I recommend getting the one with moré storage, this iPhone has 13 apps and I can only fit about 80 songs",5
I was so skeptical to buy a used phone off here BUT I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! Not a scratch on it and works perfect! Don't buy from anyone else saved so much money and I'm very satisfied,5
We purchased this item as a gift on Christmas 2014 and this item is still in use. Works like a charm with no problems. Item new in box with all accessories included. Excellent performance quality even in the middle of nowhere. It has been a great phone. We would again purchase the same item from the same seller.,5
"in the description it said it was unlocked but the sim card was locked to att, I had to go to a lot of trouble just to try and unlock the from from att, I had to go in the store presonnally and it took forever. but the phone it self is good.",3
The phone works great I have sprint service and I got my old SIM card out my iPhone 4s cuz it broke and put it in to this and it works i am really impressed,4
I'm wondering if my phone is even new.... starting to regret buying this phone & I just received it today. I cant even silence the camera shutter sound...,1
I like the fact that it came with a charger and the ear phones but the screen was slightly lifted at the top. Also it freezes up sometimes partially probably because of that. I can say other than that it is a good phone.,3
Great iPhone 5C for a used one! Has a few miner scratches but if it wasn't cause of that would off gave it 5 stars. Other than that no complaints works well.,4
The phone I received was defective. The home button does not work. It did arrive a day earlier than expected. Phone powers on and all but cannot exit any app. Cannot return to home screen. Phone is useless. I have to power it off then back on again to get to home screen.,1
I ended up taking the phone to Walmart and asked them if they could activate it. The employee inserted a new SIM card in it and activated it thru their Straight Talk wireless. When the only carrier in my small town couldn't or either wouldn't do it. Now it works fine! Will not be sending it back after all.,4
"the charger that brings the phone comes with problems and not burden and also has problems microphone output, not recommended because pay for something new and seems used",2
"ordered it and it came on time, nothing wrong with the phone. it only cost $15 for a sim card to activate your phone or switch phones (same carrier). truly decent.((my carrier is t-mobile))",5
I would have given it 5 stars except the bezel has a noticable scratch and I bought the device to use on T-Mobile in which it was advertised for.It had a Verizon sticker on it but seems to work OK so far. Otherwise its a decent iPhone and arrived on time through Amazon Prime which is a terrific service,3
This phone did not work! 50% of calls were either dropped or wouldn't go through. I can't return because window has been closed. Apple won't replace because I didn't purchase from them. I'm out $300. I recommend you do not buy!,1
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4
"This phone was a great price, and works as intended. i have always been and android user, this is my first IPhone and it works great. i also love the color.",4
"Awesome!!!It had a couple of scuff marks along the edges but other than that I was very pleasantly surprised. It was very affordable, ecspecially for a 14 year old with a small job...so happy....",5
"Ordered this IPhone 5c as a gift. Out of the box it was locked with a Indiana phone number. I brought it to an Apple Store, where they found the phone defective. Luckily they gave me a brand new phone without a hassle.",2
"8GB iPhone is USELESS. iOS takes up nearly /2 the storage -- the device is maxed out after few pictures, songs and chats. DON'T BUY AN 8GB IPHONE!!! Expensive lesson learned.",1
"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my daughter. I was so worried that it would not be what we expected it to be per online pics, but it was! My 2nd worry was whether or not I could get it activated with Metro PCS and of course I was! MY DAUGHTER HAS NO COMPLAINTS>>What u see is what you get! Love It!",5
Great phone! Down side is a phone with 8gb is obsolete. Learned this the hard way. I'm an android guy but daughter likes apple along with the rest of the brainwashed kids. Spend the money for more memory if iphone is a must.,5
I just got my phone today and it keeps freezing I have to lock it than unlock it so it will act right ..I'm so upset and I waited for this phone for so long ..just hope I don't have to pay to get another one,1
"I purchased three phones each phone is in good condition, arrival time was great, received current update from apple, so far so good from three teenagers.",5
"recieved this phone today, when i started to set it up I couldnt as it told me it had to be activated by a certain icloud account which was not mine!!!!!!!",1
"Scam! When I was buying it, it was a sim card, not iPhone! It costed 1 cent and didn't worked. They did it to get reviewes and now are changing description. What a shame!",1
"The screen had a sort of smudge in the center. We bought the telephone for testing, so we can live with that. But is a defect that wasn't advertised and in my opinion that's not ""very good"" quality.",2
"Do not buy this phone. It is USELESS I REPEAT IT IS USELESS. The screen does not work. These people sell BASURAR on amazon. I don't know y amazon grants them the permission to sell cheap, useless and garbage product on their site.",1
"bought this as a gift for my mom's bday, she absolutely adores it, much better than her previous iphone 4, fast and sleek, standard apple product, i might get the pink for myself, shipped super quick, will do business again",4
"This was the best buy for my situation, did not want to give my current phone carrier. They were able to activate this iphone with no problems. thank you.",5
Leary at first puchasing a used phone however couldn't be happier. Looks almost brand new and no problems at all with use. Will start with a used phone from this seller next time shopping for a phone.,5
Really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. I would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. Thanks!,5
Love my phone . It was used but it look brand NEW! The only thing I wasn't impressed with is that she sent me fake iPhone headsets but that's okay. Overall great seller. I recommend this seller. @Sharri International Inc 'i got the green one ',5
"the phone arrived as described in great condition. it was ready to go to a sprint store and get signed up for a sprint account, etc. I'm using it and loving it! no issues with getting a sim card, etc.",5
The product was defective. I ended up spending an additional $76.00 to repair the lcd. I didn't send it back due to having a small child and needing a phone at the moment. I advise the company to review all products before shipping.,1
"Got it in great shape. Love it. A faulty charger cable caused a bit of a scare, but otherwise, got a quality product for a decent price. Very satisfied.",4
"Initially had some issues with the phone not being unlocked, seller contacted me and rectified the situation. Phone works great and I am very happy with the product, especially the customer service.",5
The phone is as described and appears to be genuine apple product but the headphones appear to be knockoffs and actually one side quit working just days after use.,5
Phone works great but I feel like it was a refurbished phone instead of new. Phone case was dirty and inside was full of dust.Overall the phone is working properly and in very good condition.,3
"Phone was NOT NEW as described. Phone stopped working after 8 months. When I took it to the Apple store they told me my phone was a ""Franken-Phone"" made up of parts from many old phones. Apple will not repair it and I seriously doubt I will see my money again. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!",1
"Might be unlucky because this phone itself is unfuctional. It doesn't open half the time when I click the power or home button, sometimes I even flick the mute button for it to work but it doesn't. It only opens when I recieve a call",1
"I bought Apple I Phone for my mom as a gift, unfortunately it didn't work. I contact seller and I receive refund. I am very happy with customer service. I have never had so nice and understanding service.",4
"Flawless Phone!!! A+++++ besides it being practically new I got it real quick and took 2 minutes to activate with my carrier! Will do business again in a heartbeat! Thanks ""CELLAS""",5
"iphone was indeed unlocked. there was a slight misfit with my charger, but it was promptly replaced by the seller. phone looks good. needs a nano sim - you will need to buy your own for a buck, typically. absolutely new",5
"This product came earlier than the expected date. Mines were as cheap as 85 dollars , the only difficult is that i needed a sim card to activate my Phone luckily my cousin was there to let me borrow hers . phone came perfectly no scratches or nothing , a charger came with it so i recommend any body to purchase from this seller",5
I was worried at first considering the low price but I'm very happy with the my 5c it had very very small scratches and I was able to put an ATT sim in before switching to cricket wireless.no problems.5 stars all day.,5
"Sold as new, but I don't think it was. The key to open the sim card slot was missing and there was already a sim card in the phone. Otherwise, all is working well.",2
"The phone arrived extremely fast in just 2 business days, which I wasn't expecting but completely happy with! The phone looks better than I expected, almost new. It runs great. It arrived with everything the seller said it would in the listing. This was a great buy. I am extremely happy.",5
Thank goodness the phone worked. However the earphones were not the original apple earphones; they looked very cheap and you can tell they aren't from apple.,2
"This is my first iphone ever and I'm 100% satisfied. This iPhone 5c came earlier than it was supposed to arrive, looking brand new, unlocked, with 3 chargers, screen cases, headphones (not regular iPhone headphones though). All in all, I'm a happy camper.",5
Nice looking phone as usual buy Apple just screwed me up yet again with the phone memory it said it was 8gb and turned out to be 5.4 to be precise. Why do they keep shoving us up all their stupid apps that No one ever uses,1
"This phone was refurbished but still worked perfectly! There were a few noticeable scratches and scuffs on the back of the phone, but nothing a good case couldnt take away. Nothing was wrong with the phone and was exactly what I was expecting for $150. A very good deal indeed",3
I got my phone yesterday it looked brand new my Sims card counldnt fit in it so I took it to the store got exchange for a pink one but overall the phone look brand new no scratches,3
I was skeptical when I bought this product. It works perfectly. The seller also asked any questions that may arise after purchasing the product. Excellent quality and shipped fast. I highly recommend it,5
The phone looked like it went through a blender. Deep scratches all over the blue part. Turned the phone on and there was nothing but a line down the side of it. Returned for refund.,1
This was an amazing buy. I was very skeptical considering that its risky to buy a used phone.The phone is exactly as it was advertised. Shipped fast.Its been more than 3 months now and never experienced any issues.,5
"I ordered a blue 5c with 8 gigs, I got a beat up white 5c with 4 gigs. I'm thinking about returning it, but I can't go without a phone for long and I'm not sure how long it'll take for them to get me the right one. I'm bummed out.",1
"Not even 4 months into owning this phone has it stopped working, well I have no screen. I am getting texts and calls, I just can't respond to them. Not pleased at all!!!!!!",1
"i bought this product and i choose the option ''new'' now it results its refubrished. it doesnt have warranty anymore, i bought it 4 months ago. What can i do if a need the warranty now. i need an answer",1
"Purchased this for my mom. She loves it.. came when promised. Arrived in immaculate condition. Flawless.. unlocked as promised, everything works no issues, for $150 best iphone 5 u will get. . Charger included. No complaints",5
My phone came with the screen was nasty with hand prints on it & the charger was broke. Not to mention 2 of my letters won't work when I'm typing & the screen sometimes move up & down by iyself,2
"I got this phone day before yesterday. Arrived on time. The phone was sealed and is brand new. Loved it. I bought it for my mother in India. So, I will have to take it to India and check if it works with the service providers there. It should, hopefully. :)",5
Only had fone for about month and it was stolen. I'm out all that money. No one would do anything for me. Even a discount when I'm ready to purchase another fone. I just felt something could of been done that's a lot of money to be out,1
"For the price, this is an excellent entry level iOS phone.Its interesting that this phone is cheaper than a new iPod touch.Sister dropped her 4s in the toilet, this was a great replacement to that.",5
Totally better than I expected it to be. Fully functional with no problems what so ever. There is minimal wear and tear but you can barely see it. Will definitely be ordering from you guys again soon!,5
Leary at first puchasing a used phone however couldn't be happier. Looks almost brand new and no problems at all with use. Will start with a used phone from this seller next time shopping for a phone.,5
Really impressed with the quality of the phone; very easy to set up and add a plan. I would definitely recommend this retailer to anyone interested in purchasing a phone from the retailer and will definitely purchase my next one from them. Thanks!,5
Love my phone . It was used but it look brand NEW! The only thing I wasn't impressed with is that she sent me fake iPhone headsets but that's okay. Overall great seller. I recommend this seller. @Sharri International Inc 'i got the green one ',5
"It came very fast, cute phone and of course amazing Apple quality, the only weird thing is that even the phone was new, it came with a sim card inside of the phone...",4
I gave it one star because i didnt get the color I wanted I got white and I didnt give it back or return it because I have been waiting for a phone for along time I wasn't about to give my phone back jus because of the color of it but I was made at first but then I got over it,1
Item came fast and everything was great up until I broke my screen after a week of having it. It's a plastic screen and not a real glass one👎. All in all still a great phone be buy and mind blowing price,4
"The phone works great!!! Although, a few days after I received the phone, the charger that came with it stopped working. I was sent a new charger and it charges my phone very slowly. I let them know again and they are sending me another charger. They help solve their customers problems and I highly recommend you buy their products. HAPPY BUYING (:",5
"Perfect all the way around but if you are a big music fan I recommend getting the one with moré storage, this iPhone has 13 apps and I can only fit about 80 songs",5
"In compelled to write a review. I read them consistently, but never write them. You'd never know this phone wasn't brand new. My daughter was ecstatic and I saved a lot of money. Delivery was fast as always. Came with earbuds and charger and packaging looked exactly like new iPhone. Loved it!!",5
Phone in excellent. New shape.Issues: 1. charger is not working. Heats up fast. 2. When switching to silent mode from side. Makes a loud vibrating sound when switched on.,4
The iPhone 5c in blue the chargers port won't hold the charges. So that why I return the iPhone 5c. You guys need to check all phones before shipping it.,2
"It looks really great - I haven't Given it to my son because it's a gift for my for Christmas so I'll let you know them, but it looks fine and packaged nicely. Thank You - he will be using it as an I pod everything but a telephone because he's only nine",5
this phone have bad quality the sound barley works the screen blanked out after the first day of having it I do not recommend anyone to order this phone.,1
"This phone isn't working: battery dies in few hours and there are too many bugs to list. I don't recommend as I had to go back to old phone, this is not reliable for use and seller refused to replace it.",1
Phone only worked for one day! Then we couldn't get it to turn on anymore no matter how long we charged it! We will never purchase anything else used on amazon it has to be new!,1
Item is in good condition only a few cosmetic scratches. After startup worked perfectly. I had one small issue and the company corrected that immediately. I have no complaints about this purchase.,4
I had gotten the phone and the condition is great but the screen had issues and I had to pay an extra amount of money to get it replaced. But otherwise works great.,3
"I really like this phone, the battery life is longer than my 4s, it has some scratch on the back but nothing that a case can't fix. Thanks so much from Dominican Republic.",4
"I am so pleased with this phone. I had been looking for one for weeks, but they were so expensive. Especially with the 32g that I wanted. It came in good time, in good condition. And I love it! Everything was as it should be.",5
"It's an amazing iPhone, it met my standards but it brought a cover for a galaxy phone instead of an iPhone 5c which I ended up not using, other than that I like it.",4
"Works like a dream! Very intuative. My first iphone and I caught on quick and I am 66. Best of all with it unlocked, i can use any provider wherever I live.",5

"The phone seems to be decent, but I can't be sure. The listing says it is unlocked, and can be used on Verizon Wireless 4G LTE plans, but when I tried to activate it with the carrier, I was told it cannot be used with them. This was supposed to be my son's 13th birthday gift, now I have to make other plans.",2
I ordered this to replace a previous phone I bought on Amazon that simply stopped working after 1 week. So far this iPhone seems to be working well and I have had no problems. The battery isn't that great but thats to be expected with an older phone.,4
"This phone lasted me 4 good years. Worked very well. I upgraded to a 7 last week & honestly its just like it. Only difference is that the screen on the 7 is bigger. Didn't see much difference in camera. If you like small phones or are scared about dropping a big phone then this phone is just for you. Gets the job of being a phone, done.",5
Terrible product. It's a poorly refurbished phone. The battery and the screen failed from the first day. Apple didn't received it of warranty and when they opened it they told me it was a poorly refurbished phone. Wouldn't purchase this item again.,1
"The phone arrived as guarenteed, it was a Christmas present for my 11 year old daughter! Phone is in excellent condition, looks brand new! Works perfectly, color is great! I would definitely recommended thi seller, and purchase again! Thank you!",5
Used this phone for two hours and it keeps dying. The battery is not good. I purchased two phones from this seller and they are both unusable. Very disappointing. Save yourself the trouble of waiting for a messed up phone and having to return it. Try a phone from someone else. Obviously these are not refurbished and just being sold under that name.,1

"5 Stars. The phone and accessories appear to be brand new. I contacted the seller and asked to speed up shipping for traveling reasons, and they did without an issue. Highly recommended",5

this phone have bad quality the sound barley works the screen blanked out after the first day of having it I do not recommend anyone to order this phone.,1
I purchased this phone in June and almost exactly 6 months later my phone turned off and would not turn on my battery life was failing badly for maybe 2 weeks before it turned off and would not turn on.,1
I purchased this iPhone and within one week it stopped working completely. It would not switch on no matter what I did. I did return it and am expecting a full refund so that part of the product service was good.,1
Yes Yes Yes phone in Perfect working conditions and I also upgrade it to IOS 10.1.1. It seems like what ever negative issues that was said about the phone the seller make sure and treat with these issues. I am buying another phone like this asap for my wife.,5
The phone was filthy when I received it. Dirt debris on bottom of phone and all in the creases of the phone face. Gross. Had to wipe down w disinfectant before using.,1

Came on time but the charger did not work and did not come with headphones or any manuals. It also did not come with the little key to open the sim slot,3
Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,1
Phone arrived quickly as described and worked great for a week. After a day bouncing between Apple and my carrier Apple replaced the phone for a new one. The new phone lasted a week and I had to make another appointment with Apple and they replaced that phone. Quality control could be better. Has all the bells and whistle to keep my daughter happy.,4
"Good phone and in good condition, but recently discovered that this is only an Iphone 5, not a 5s. Also, it didn't come with the stock earbuds, which are expensive. FALSE ADVERTISING.",2
This was advertised as new. Took it to Apple as the battery was depleted after 2 months. They refused to work on it because the battery was third party as were many of the buttons and inner working!! This was not as advertised at all.,1
"This person is a scam artist. I bought my phone, everything works great for a while, then it is reported that the payments are not being made on it and the IMIE is blocked. This person knows exactly what they are doing and they are criminals.",1
"Great customer service! I love my new phone! And the best part is I got it from a really good price! Other places were charging me almost 1,000 for this phone but I got it here for 600. I'm very pleased. Thank you.",5
"This is a very good iphone model. There is a problem that hopefully gets resolved later. If you accidentally push the bottom center button to long, it goes into voice over mode that is difficult to get out of!",4
Great Phone!!! Great phone to have in our system. This phone is also feel like is one of our part in our body system. I really enjoy this phone. Without this phone I feel like handicapped.,5
The phone goes on and off on its own. It also says that the battery is charged and goes dead anytime. I will never purchase a phone from this person ever again. I brought for my daughter cannot call me at times because phone goes dead on its own and with battery says it on 64%.😡,1
I bought this for a friend.1. The product arrived very quickly. It didn't take the amount of time that amazon said it would so that's always a plus.2. Minimal damage to the phone. It worked like a charm3. It's STILL working. lol. My friend is horrible with phones and yet he's managed to keep this one in tact.,5
"the back camera stopped working, the phone touch screen stops working and i have to restart the phone to get it to work. The phone is a huge disappointment. Not worth what i paid for it.",1
"Phone was fine at first, but after two weeks it was constantly shutting down. The power button got stuck down. Took the phone to Apple and they said it was toast. I was able to return this phone through Amazon though for a full refund and ended up just buying a new I-Phone 6 from my wireless provider.",1
"Perfect perfect perfect! My phone came right on time. I got it and it was like new just as he said. He also sent a charger and a cute pink otter box which was great, because I didn't have to go out and buy one. Thanks!!",5
"i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs though. They are involved with Dr Dre now and I heard they are going to make bigger phones, something Steve Jobs was against. Guess we will see.",5
This person selling this item is a liar .. I asked specifically if this unit is for t mobile. The sell told me yes.. I put a tmobile SIM card in this phone that was sent to me but it did not read because the Carrier was sent to sprint,1
"As of November 2015 this phones memory is just about full. 16 GB is simply NOT enough space....and I'm not a big ""apps"" person, but I do like to save my pictures. Otherwise I have no complaints.",4
"I just received this ""unlocked"" iphone 5s two days ago and was happy until I but I tried to put my sim card in. No service so I called my carrier T-Mobile and oh guess what the phone has a carrier lock on it with guess who T-Mobile. Needless to say I'm pissed and without a phone or money and have yet to get a reply or a refund. ZERO STARS!!!",1
I am super happy with this vendor. The Iphone came in super fast before it was suposeto and it was almost brand new and it works. It was the best purchase I've made. My son is super happy! Thanks,5
"Don't waste your money on this phone. I bought this phone a month ago and I kept getting this blue screen, then it reboots itself over and over again. Doesn't work well with T-Mobile like it said, I tried sending it back but they won't take it back. One month into my iPhone and I'm now looking to buy another phone.",1
it crazy if you lunch an app it takes you outcant hear people without headphones and for them you sound farand cant take phonescalls sometimes it impossible would not recomended,1
This was supposed to be new! It's two years old! I was mislead into believing I was buying a new iPhone. Now it's messing up and I went to Apple Store and they told me its two years old and warranty is up! I got ripped of!!!!!!!!!!,1
Real iphone 5s. Came in factory box sealed up like an apple store would sell it to you. It has some better features than the 4 and is ALOT faster! I like it! I sanded down my old sim card for my 4 and it fit in my 5 (save $10-20 on a sim card at tmobile),5
"Im loving it....So far it works very good no problems, no damages, scratches or anything. Came on time arrived by the 20th which was a couple days ago. It's all what was described about the iPhone 5s and to say im glad i bought it.",5
"Though fully packaged, it is not totally new.Checking on the Apple support (the Apple web), it says this phone's Telephone Technical Support has already EXPIRED, and only 1 months to Repairs and Service Coverage Expiration Date. Which means it registered about 1 years ago.",2
"Came on time, but a little skeptical about whether or not it was actually new.Other than that the product works great and I'm using it to type this review right now!",5
"Scam, the phone was barred off the network after 1 week due to ""Unpaid payments in the T-Mobile payment plan"", returned immediately to amazon. I'm very disappointed.",1
Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,1
Serious problems with the phone. Isnt compatible with tmobile but says in the factory settings that the carrier is tmobile. Also isn't unlocked like they claim to be. Don't buy the phone it's just a huge hassle,1
A very good device. My only problem is its size. It is heavy in a shirt pocket and inconvenient in hip pocket of a trouser. It slips out very easily from a pocket. I have lost it already 3 times in the last six months but fortunately each time I could find it.,4
Just got my iPhone in the mail thisy 3rd day using it and everything I just like a brand new iPhone 5s no regrets here for the price I got it...... so far.,5
"Probably could've found better prices , also the battery drains fast a few weeks after I bought it, recenty just shut down for no reason when it was at 70% .",3
"Had to return the phone. After 10 days of the phone, phone became blocked and could not be used. The phone came out of service and couldn't not be used to call or text.",1
"I read a couple of bad reviews, but my experience its been great. I got a brand new IPhone, in a sealed box with all the accessories and works perfectly fine.",5
This seller is amazing! I asked about a million questions and they were More than happy to respond to them. When I got the phone I cut my SIM card down to size and it responded immediately! Phone is basically perfect!!,5
I enjoy the fingerprint addition so when people are nearby I can just touch the home button to unlock my phone without anyone lurking to see me enter my unlock code.,5
Great phone works well with T-Mobile. Game new out-of-the-box in perfect mint condition. It's the right size phone for me I had a Samsung galaxy S3 before that wouldn't fit in my pocket. This phone is lightning fastsyncs with my iTunes automatically can't say enough good things about it. Seller shipped fast no issues,5
I love this phone! I cut my original Sim card that was in my Samsung Galaxy and put it in the new Iphone 5s and it works great.Internet responds super fast and the fingerprint unlock is amazing. Condition is perfect and it came in the original box. I'm very happy with my purchase.,5
"It all came in a sealed box, the phone was new and works great. My only problem was that the part that connects to the wall to charge doesn't work too well so I had to use a different connector.",5
"This phone sucks!!😒 Do not waste your money on this product. The first day I got it, it was powering off by itself many times. It always froze. I bought it 4 months ago and now it does not work at all!!! The screen popped out all the time. Even tho it says new it is definitely used! Worst phone I probably ever had !",1

Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,1
Phone arrived quickly as described and worked great for a week. After a day bouncing between Apple and my carrier Apple replaced the phone for a new one. The new phone lasted a week and I had to make another appointment with Apple and they replaced that phone. Quality control could be better. Has all the bells and whistle to keep my daughter happy.,4
"This phone is okay. My son purchased it, he didn't realize how little storage there is. He is constantly deleting nearly all apps and photos to make the phone operable.",3
"Phone was in perfect condition when I got it, everything was fine, until I put the SIM in. Phone was blocked on my network and was reported as stolen. Needless to say, I am NOT happy with this outcome.",1
Great item! Received it a day earlier than expected but works great! Good condition except for stickers on back! Other than that great deal! I reccomend!,5
"Perfect perfect perfect! My phone came right on time. I got it and it was like new just as he said. He also sent a charger and a cute pink otter box which was great, because I didn't have to go out and buy one. Thanks!!",5
"i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs though. They are involved with Dr Dre now and I heard they are going to make bigger phones, something Steve Jobs was against. Guess we will see.",5
This person selling this item is a liar .. I asked specifically if this unit is for t mobile. The sell told me yes.. I put a tmobile SIM card in this phone that was sent to me but it did not read because the Carrier was sent to sprint,1
Serious problems with the phone. Isnt compatible with tmobile but says in the factory settings that the carrier is tmobile. Also isn't unlocked like they claim to be. Don't buy the phone it's just a huge hassle,1
Came on time but the charger did not work and did not come with headphones or any manuals. It also did not come with the little key to open the sim slot,3
it crazy if you lunch an app it takes you outcant hear people without headphones and for them you sound farand cant take phonescalls sometimes it impossible would not recomended,1
This was supposed to be new! It's two years old! I was mislead into believing I was buying a new iPhone. Now it's messing up and I went to Apple Store and they told me its two years old and warranty is up! I got ripped of!!!!!!!!!!,1
This seller is amazing! I asked about a million questions and they were More than happy to respond to them. When I got the phone I cut my SIM card down to size and it responded immediately! Phone is basically perfect!!,5
The phone goes on and off on its own. It also says that the battery is charged and goes dead anytime. I will never purchase a phone from this person ever again. I brought for my daughter cannot call me at times because phone goes dead on its own and with battery says it on 64%.😡,1
Amazing quality. I knew what i was receiving because i already owned an iphone 5S. Unexpected fast delivery. Definitely will buy again ( if i break this one..haha),5
"It all came in a sealed box, the phone was new and works great. My only problem was that the part that connects to the wall to charge doesn't work too well so I had to use a different connector.",5
"Great customer service! I love my new phone! And the best part is I got it from a really good price! Other places were charging me almost 1,000 for this phone but I got it here for 600. I'm very pleased. Thank you.",5
"This is a very good iphone model. There is a problem that hopefully gets resolved later. If you accidentally push the bottom center button to long, it goes into voice over mode that is difficult to get out of!",4
Great Phone!!! Great phone to have in our system. This phone is also feel like is one of our part in our body system. I really enjoy this phone. Without this phone I feel like handicapped.,5
"This phone sucks!!😒 Do not waste your money on this product. The first day I got it, it was powering off by itself many times. It always froze. I bought it 4 months ago and now it does not work at all!!! The screen popped out all the time. Even tho it says new it is definitely used! Worst phone I probably ever had !",1
I enjoy the fingerprint addition so when people are nearby I can just touch the home button to unlock my phone without anyone lurking to see me enter my unlock code.,5
Great phone works well with T-Mobile. Game new out-of-the-box in perfect mint condition. It's the right size phone for me I had a Samsung galaxy S3 before that wouldn't fit in my pocket. This phone is lightning fastsyncs with my iTunes automatically can't say enough good things about it. Seller shipped fast no issues,5
I love this phone! I cut my original Sim card that was in my Samsung Galaxy and put it in the new Iphone 5s and it works great.Internet responds super fast and the fingerprint unlock is amazing. Condition is perfect and it came in the original box. I'm very happy with my purchase.,5
Real iphone 5s. Came in factory box sealed up like an apple store would sell it to you. It has some better features than the 4 and is ALOT faster! I like it! I sanded down my old sim card for my 4 and it fit in my 5 (save $10-20 on a sim card at tmobile),5
I bought this for a friend.1. The product arrived very quickly. It didn't take the amount of time that amazon said it would so that's always a plus.2. Minimal damage to the phone. It worked like a charm3. It's STILL working. lol. My friend is horrible with phones and yet he's managed to keep this one in tact.,5
"the back camera stopped working, the phone touch screen stops working and i have to restart the phone to get it to work. The phone is a huge disappointment. Not worth what i paid for it.",1
"Phone was fine at first, but after two weeks it was constantly shutting down. The power button got stuck down. Took the phone to Apple and they said it was toast. I was able to return this phone through Amazon though for a full refund and ended up just buying a new I-Phone 6 from my wireless provider.",1
A very good device. My only problem is its size. It is heavy in a shirt pocket and inconvenient in hip pocket of a trouser. It slips out very easily from a pocket. I have lost it already 3 times in the last six months but fortunately each time I could find it.,4
Just got my iPhone in the mail thisy 3rd day using it and everything I just like a brand new iPhone 5s no regrets here for the price I got it...... so far.,5
Phone arrived quickly as described and worked great for a week. After a day bouncing between Apple and my carrier Apple replaced the phone for a new one. The new phone lasted a week and I had to make another appointment with Apple and they replaced that phone. Quality control could be better. Has all the bells and whistle to keep my daughter happy.,4
"Though fully packaged, it is not totally new.Checking on the Apple support (the Apple web), it says this phone's Telephone Technical Support has already EXPIRED, and only 1 months to Repairs and Service Coverage Expiration Date. Which means it registered about 1 years ago.",2
"Came on time, but a little skeptical about whether or not it was actually new.Other than that the product works great and I'm using it to type this review right now!",5
"Scam, the phone was barred off the network after 1 week due to ""Unpaid payments in the T-Mobile payment plan"", returned immediately to amazon. I'm very disappointed.",1
Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,1
"So far so great! I was a little hesitate buying a refurbished phone, but I have had zero issues! It runs great, hardly any scratches or scuffs and the 64GB of storage is amazing compared to the 8GB of storage I had on my iPhone 4S. Really glad I found this awesome deal on Black Friday!",5
"I was hesitant about buying this phone online, but it came better than expected. Clean with no scratches and works great. I inserted my SIM card and was using it instantly.",5
This is my 3rd refurbished iPhone from Amazon and I'm very happy. Works great. You can't beat the price and they always guarantee that they work well.,5
"I bought this to replace my iPhone 6 that got stolen a few weeks ago. I couldn't afford to purchase another 6 so I decided the 5S would suffice. I received the phone today and so far, I am very happy with my purchase. It looks like it has never been used and it works perfectly. It arrived much earlier than expected as well so that is a plus!",5
"My husband got me this iPhone 5s for my birthday. I absolutely love it. The reason I'm only giving it 4/5 stars is because the charger port was just FILLED with lint and junk, affecting its ability to charge. My husband had to dig all the lint out with a safety pin.",4
"I'm super happy with my new phone, it works up to every standard and is fast. When I got the phone I noticed that there is very small wear and tear. Only one or two scratches on the screen but overall I couldn't have asked for a much better phone with this much space for this cheap",5
Apple IPhone 5S is working perfectly. No problem getting phone connected thru Verizon service and their free SIMM Card. Very happy with Amazon timely service also.Thank you.,4
"Awesome phone. Works perfect, great price point for brand new phone! Couldn't be happier. Customer service was world class. Will definitely buy here again.",5
"I'm still using this iphone now after purchasing it months ago, but the fingerprint unlocking mechanism stopped working less than a month in. It's a fine phone but I wish that aspect of it hadn't quit so soon.",4
"Be sure to check out to confirm the phone is fully working within the 30 days. If not, no refund or credit. We purchased a phone and it completely died within (6) months. Should have just bought it through my cell company. I feel for the price I paid, it should work a lot longer.",2
"I got this in the mail and it came with a little kit to clean the screen and then a REALLY nice screen protector. It was a nice little surprise. Anyways, I put a phone case on and it looks brand new! It also works great.",5
Phone is great! Everything is like it said in the description. Had to go to the I phone store for help setting up but that was a minor delay and it worked shortly after. The 30 day warranty was very re-assuring however I won't be returning this phone. Very happy thanks,5
"This phone is garbage. I've had it for less than three months and it's always having problems. Constantly freezing, kicking me out of apps, and dying way above 0% (yesterday it was at 43% when it decided to die).I had such high hopes for this seller and was very disappointed.",1
"I bought an used - like new one. There are little scratch, but I like it very much. I used it for some days, there was not any problem. But the battery cyclecounts are 292 times, very high rate. So 3 stars.",3
"The phone was nice, but the used model sent came with a broken proximity sensor and the home button was a little funky. We returned it and went through Verizon for a brand new phone instead.",3
The shipping was on time. It said it would be here Friday by 8pm I got it Friday at 10am. Took the phone to Verizon to activate it and it works! Very pleased and very pleased with the price I paid for a good phone!,5
"The I-phone met all my expectations related to appearance, however the battery is weak and does not hold charge very well, and I am a very light user, it will need a new battery soon which is an extra $50 !",4
"Mobile phone appearance at a line still, there is a slight scratches, can accept, but found that the battery is charging when use more than 300 times, for it is not satisfied",2
"Said the phone was in 'Good' condition. There was one tiny pinprick of a scratch on the back, but other than that it is flawless. This company is good. It was also simple to activate.",5
"Great form finish, metal and glass feel phenomenal. Cases don't add too much bulk due to already minimal dimensions. Fantastic phone& reliable operating system. Would definitely recommend even in 2016.",5
"Though the phone barely has any scratches or mishandling marks, the iPhone I received has a bad case of ghost tapping. Minus this annoying factor, the iPhone runs smoothly and the battery last as long as any other iPhone.",3
"The operating system failed within 4 months, beyond repair. The warranty with the seller was just 30 days. Very unfriendly return/exchange policy for an expensive item one expects to last at least a couple of years. SELLER/PRODUCT NOT RECOMMENDED.",1
"Although the phone itself was good, it turns out to be a non-verizon machine. which doesn't work with verizon simcard. I think they didn't test it. before selling.",1
"Not too happy with this item. Say you can have connected with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile but no sim card came with it, price out rages, and can't get it hock up for a phone use. So very unhappy as it took a long time to try all the different cell phone companies and nothing unless we buy a Sims card and still nothing. This was bull.",2
Purchased this phone brand new and it's amazing better than I expected it to be. I had concerns that it wouldn't be as good as it looks but it was great and not sure why there are bad reviews about the company selling it?,5
"My iPhone arrived sealed in the box. Everything was perfect! I needed mine for Verizon Wireless, so I can't say if it was unlocked or not. The phone had all the accessories it was supposed to come with and everything works well. I am pleased!",5
"The phone turned out to be a Verizon phone, and was not ""unlocked"" to be used on other networks.This was definitely false advertizing and currently struggling to return it for full refund...do to traveling.",1
"I've had the top of the line Android phones and every single iphone ever and the iphone is the best phone there is and at this rate ever will be...whether it be because of design or performance, it's the better phone.",5
What can I say! I amSuper pleased . Arrived befor time set on amazon. Seller kept in touch w mePersonally To tell me about items I bought. Explained what I Was goingTo receive Very clear and was very helpful! Christmas presents for my kids they are very happy . THANK YOU!,5
"The phone came looking fine, but sometimes the screen glitches and isn't coordinated with where I tap, and sometimes just plain old wigs out and does random things when I'm not even touching the screen. But I can't afford the time to not have a phone so I'm just gonna deal with it for now.",3
"very happy with purchase. phone was in very good shape, very little wear apparent. screen and case looked close to perfect. works just as new and NO trouble getting it on my verizon account (no charge). came exactly as described and on time. Id buy from them again.",5
"as advertised. complete with charger and earbuds (earbuds are no as good as the Originals, but it is nice to have them included) Would purchase from seller again",5
"Phone was in fair condition. The case had more scratches than originally suggested. For the price, however, a great purchase and delivered very quickly.",3
I'm real happy with my iPhone 5S it works great has a lot of features on it and I just upgraded me to a better phone I love the tracking system that Amazon offers you know exactly when you're going to receive it,5
"just get the phone ,almost brandnew, no any scratch on the screen or back cover, love it, better then the iPhone 4 what i bought last year. btw, the cable and earphone are orighnal as well, not the cheap copy.",5
"To start with when I took the phone into the store to get it switched with the old one the numbers off of the new box were not good. But when we got the phone out charged it and used the numbers off of it, it worked ok. So at first I was a little heaitant that it was real. It all worked out in the long run though.",4
Every function on the phone works well however Bluetooth and wireless are broken. Tried several reboots with the software so it must be a hardware issue. Very disappointing. Not worth the $300+ I paid for it.,2
"Phone worked great for like two weeks. Turns out it wasn't brand new at all, screen started ghost clicking and when I took it to the apple store to use the ""warranty"" it comes with they said it wasn't even new and the warranty wouldn't cover it.",1
"I do not know if these reviews are seller specific but I order the phone from ""Next Level Mobile"" which was labeled as ""new"" after around 3.5 months the display was not working, when I brought it to Apple they said they could not fix the problem because it has been replaced with a ""third party display"".",1
I had ran into a problem with my phone just a week after i had it. i took it to the apple store and they said they couldn't do anything to it because it wasn't an Apple product. It was one of those fake phones from China. now i have to invest in another phone.,1
"When I got it, I was expecting some glitches. The first time I plugged it in, it decided to scream beeping noises at me that it couldn't keep up the connection. It has gotten better since then. I just it just needed to be loved again to get better.I still feel like I paid too much.",3
"Phone was advertised as new, but was defective. Took it to the apple store and they said it came up on their computer as recycled. HMMMM Am having to return it.",1
"Product arrived quickly. Showed signs of minimal wear, just a slight rub mark from when it had been in a case. Was activated thru Verizon online account in a matter of minutes. Functions as expected. No complaints yet, only had it a few days tho. Came in non-factory box, included a new charger in good condition. Pleased with my order.",4
"Terrible. Phone took first charge to 100%. At 30% it went to 0 and turned off. Next charge to %100, then dead after 2 hours. It then wouldn't even take a charge. Garbage",1
"I was disappointed when I received the phone and found out that it is not usable on Verizon, even though it clearly stated in the description that it is a Verizon cell phone.",1
"Phone is OK, but when I use the earbuds with mic, the mic does not work. I notified the company and was sent two new sets of earbuds. One of the sets does not have sound from the left side. Still cannot use the mic with this phone. Disappointed.",3
It came quickly and the phone looks like its brand new. My only issue is that it does some weird things whenI try to use it while its charging. Other than that it works perfectly!,4
"The phone overall works fine, but I Just didn't like that it came with headphones and not a charger. The screen was really dirty when I opened the box too. I just say never take a picture of stuff that isn't going to be included. False advertising!!",3
"This phone was a promised by the seller. I actually thought I had an issue with the phone and the seller went over the top to help me. The most amazing seller I have ever dealt with. As far as the phone, my daughter LOVES it!",5
I bought a refurbished phone and it came in on time. Works very well and since its a refurbished phone then there is still some very light scratched on the side but it doesn't bother me. Overall good buy. Nice camera quality!,5
I got this product at the end of September and it worked for about 3 weeks until one day lines appeared on the screen and it is now defective. I would not recommend buying this product unless you want a broken iphone.,1
"Phone arrived sooner than expected. Very clean, no signs of use. So far is working just fine. I use it for Page Plus Cellular and I was able to transfer my old number to this new phone without any problems. Great Phone.",5
"This has been a good purchase. The battery life isn't as good as we hoped. Sometimes it dies with 20% left to go. But for the price we got it, I didn't really expect it to be perfect. Other than that, there have been no problems.",4
"I haven't had a lick of trouble when I got this phone. Not one. It works great, came with everything I needed it to come with, is just what I wanted. Great quality.",5
I'm not sure how I bought this phone for $350 with 64 gigabytes of internal memory but I did ........and it works perfectly on Verizon Wireless.....can't beat it........ came in great condition.....WIFE loves it.,5
"Went to Verizon Corp store, put the sim card in, turned it on and was up and running in minutes. Completed OS upgrade in 20 minutes, restored iCloud data and was good to go.",4
"Very pleased. I love it. I was expecting more scratches because of shipping but only one or two on back. A small dent on the top of the phone but not noticable in the picture. I would recommend getting this phone, you will not regret it!",5
"Well unfortunately my my phone went swimming and I was forced to decide between buying a new phone for $600 or buy a used one. I got an iPhone 5s in mint condition for less than $200 shipped to my door step in just a few days. Very pleased, would highly recommend this phone and for anybody facing the same situation as me",5
Phone came in mail pretty reasonably but the phone won't turn on or take a charge...seller obviously didn't check to make sure it worked before sending it out. They are based out of Brooklyn so I'm sure they are a lot of shady stores there.,1
This cell phone was easy to start up with Verizon. I bought this phone for my daughter who lives out of state so our family could stay connected. My daughter loves this phone.,5
"Bought this phone for my teenager after getting tired of spending ridiculous amounts of money on the ""latest and greatest"". I have had no regrets. The iPhone has worked great and saved me hundreds of dollars over the price of the latest iPhone.",5
Screen started going out shortly after activating the phone. Took it to the apple store to hear that it needs a whole new screen. It is now fully understood why the phone was put up for sale to begin with.,1
I bought iphone5s in 2014. but yesterday my earphone was bad.I went to the Apple Store to repair earphone.They told me the earphone is not original earphone.I find I can not find any word in the earphone about Assembled in China.I think you sell me fake accessories！！！I think this is a very serious problem.,1
"Had an iPhone5, went to a Galaxy S5 (hated it), went back to iPhone (5S this time). Performance is noticeably better than the iPhone5 and SO much better than my S5 (especially after the Lollipop update). Battery life much better than S5, too. Love it!",5
"Purchased as ""used"" but it arrived in like-new condition complete with charger, cable, and ear buds. Been using the phone for several days now and it works exactly as expected. Out of the box, I had to charge it, then took it to the Verizon store where they verified the ESN was clean, and then installed a verizon sim card. No complaints at all.",5
"This is the first phone I've bought on Amazon. I was kind of leery but the phone came within 2 days, with an estimated 5 to 7 business day shipping expectation. The phone was Verizon ready, no scratches, chips, or any kind of damage on the phone. I love it. And would definitely recommend it.",5
Had an issue with finger print controls. Customer service outstanding they sent me another phone fast fast fast. Perfect phone. Love the newer features over iphone4,5
This does NOT work on Verizon!!!! Very disappointed and sent back immediately after taking to the Verizon store and being told it couldn't be activated.,1
"I was told that this iPhone would work with the Verizon network, but it is for AT&T instead. Otherwise I would love it because the seller was really accommodating and the price was great.",4
"Had it for 4 months now and no issues thankfully. I'm giving 5 stars because it's exactly what it described it as. Some normal wear & tear, but it works well and hasn't let me down yet.",5
"I was expecting to get a phone with a few scratches, but the phone was like new. There were no problems getting it set up and it's working perfectly. I purchased the phone for my son and he's very happy with it.",5
"Received my iphone 5s, bought from thegizmogadgets.. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and looks absolutely new, no visible scratch seen, although the battery is a bit used already but it still fine..",5
"Bought this from Best Price Phones or kugs8989, in February - listed as NEW. Today, June 6, the battery is dead and will not hold a charge. Seller has disappeared. I've had the same model of phone since it was first issued in 2013, and it is still going strong.",1
"The screen had a couple of glitches with brightness initially, but it seems to have resolved and is working well. I would purchase a new phone with this seller again.",4
Major cons: (not negotiable)- speaker phone function is roughly 50% of how loud it needs to be. Makes listening to music or talking to people using the speaker pointless without headphones- Bluetooth function will not even display other devices to link to. Completely inoperable Bluetooth capabilityPros:-clean screen with little scratches or dings,1
Every function on the phone works well however Bluetooth and wireless are broken. Tried several reboots with the software so it must be a hardware issue. Very disappointing. Not worth the $300+ I paid for it.,2
"Phone worked great for like two weeks. Turns out it wasn't brand new at all, screen started ghost clicking and when I took it to the apple store to use the ""warranty"" it comes with they said it wasn't even new and the warranty wouldn't cover it.",1

"So much faster than my iPhone 4s.Everything came in the box... iPhone, charging cable and plug, Verizon sim card, earplugs. I took it to Verizon to switch over to my new iPhone 5s but the rep in the store told me that I could have done the setup at home. :)",5
"I bought this to replace my iPhone 6 that got stolen a few weeks ago. I couldn't afford to purchase another 6 so I decided the 5S would suffice. I received the phone today and so far, I am very happy with my purchase. It looks like it has never been used and it works perfectly. It arrived much earlier than expected as well so that is a plus!",5
I'm not sure how I bought this phone for $350 with 64 gigabytes of internal memory but I did ........and it works perfectly on Verizon Wireless.....can't beat it........ came in great condition.....WIFE loves it.,5
This product came in earlier than expected. As said in the description this phone did have evidence of usage but if you wear a case on it then you can't see the damage and it looks brand new with a case of it. I love it so much. I would recommend buying this.,5
"Everything was as described, very little wear overall (phone was a little dirty but it cleaned up like new with a little rubbing alcohol). It arrived on time, activation went smoothly and the phone is in great working order. 10/10 would order again.",5
"this is my first smartphone,,s0,,, it will take some time to learn how to use,,battery goes dead in 24 hours with very limited use---that sucks---phone was as listed,, looks good,, works good, i guess",5
Phone came in mail pretty reasonably but the phone won't turn on or take a charge...seller obviously didn't check to make sure it worked before sending it out. They are based out of Brooklyn so I'm sure they are a lot of shady stores there.,1

"Great form finish, metal and glass feel phenomenal. Cases don't add too much bulk due to already minimal dimensions. Fantastic phone& reliable operating system. Would definitely recommend even in 2016.",5
This product came in great with no scratches on it! The only issue I had was that I have to leave my cellular data turned on at all times in order for the iMessaging to work. (I just turn on the cellular data and shut it off for all the apps I have so they don't use up all my data),5
Great phone. Did not look used hardly at all. Worked very well. We just took the sim card from the old Verizon Samsung and put it in this one. Very seamless!,5
"My iPhone arrived sealed in the box. Everything was perfect! I needed mine for Verizon Wireless, so I can't say if it was unlocked or not. The phone had all the accessories it was supposed to come with and everything works well. I am pleased!",5

"Not too happy with this item. Say you can have connected with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile but no sim card came with it, price out rages, and can't get it hock up for a phone use. So very unhappy as it took a long time to try all the different cell phone companies and nothing unless we buy a Sims card and still nothing. This was bull.",2
Purchased this phone brand new and it's amazing better than I expected it to be. I had concerns that it wouldn't be as good as it looks but it was great and not sure why there are bad reviews about the company selling it?,5
"Received my new Iphone 5s today and looks used. I bought as new and paid new price for the phone. Box was beaten up, had been opened and re taped. Charged the phone and it had already been setup. Will see how it works but not very happy",3
"Product arrived quickly. Showed signs of minimal wear, just a slight rub mark from when it had been in a case. Was activated thru Verizon online account in a matter of minutes. Functions as expected. No complaints yet, only had it a few days tho. Came in non-factory box, included a new charger in good condition. Pleased with my order.",4

Thrilled to have this iPhone! Still learning how to use it with ALL the features. Don't know what your missing until you have it in your hot little hand. Wonderful machine.,5
"Haven't activated this phone yet, as it is a Christmas gift, but the phone is in great condition (as described). So far, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Will update this review, if it is necessary.Update: We absolutely love this phone and I am very satisfied with the purchase.",5
I bought this phone and then receive a iPhone 5! Not a 5s. Just a 5. I get it. The battery percentage is wrong so my phone shuts off at 35%. My touch screen lags and fidgets all the time. And my microphone hardly works. This company is terrible! Don't ever buy from them!!!,1
"I received the phone. The screen was loose. The digitizer was non- responsive. It looked like it was put together in a backyard shack, by a bunch of blind elves. Simply put. It's junk.",1
"They may say its a new screen, but its replaced with a third party aftermarket screen that is not OEM.Apple refuses to service any iphone that has an aftemarket screen.",1
The phone arrived in pristine condition to replace an iPhone 4 my daughter had soaked. It just needed the replacement sim card. I have one and love it for all the features and compact size--easy to slip in a pocket and yet very readable.,5
This product came in earlier than expected. As said in the description this phone did have evidence of usage but if you wear a case on it then you can't see the damage and it looks brand new with a case of it. I love it so much. I would recommend buying this.,5
Screen started going out shortly after activating the phone. Took it to the apple store to hear that it needs a whole new screen. It is now fully understood why the phone was put up for sale to begin with.,1
"The I-phone met all my expectations related to appearance, however the battery is weak and does not hold charge very well, and I am a very light user, it will need a new battery soon which is an extra $50 !",4
"Mobile phone appearance at a line still, there is a slight scratches, can accept, but found that the battery is charging when use more than 300 times, for it is not satisfied",2
"Said the phone was in 'Good' condition. There was one tiny pinprick of a scratch on the back, but other than that it is flawless. This company is good. It was also simple to activate.",5
"I was told that this iPhone would work with the Verizon network, but it is for AT&T instead. Otherwise I would love it because the seller was really accommodating and the price was great.",4
"Had it for 4 months now and no issues thankfully. I'm giving 5 stars because it's exactly what it described it as. Some normal wear & tear, but it works well and hasn't let me down yet.",5
"I was expecting to get a phone with a few scratches, but the phone was like new. There were no problems getting it set up and it's working perfectly. I purchased the phone for my son and he's very happy with it.",5
"I bought an used - like new one. There are little scratch, but I like it very much. I used it for some days, there was not any problem. But the battery cyclecounts are 292 times, very high rate. So 3 stars.",3
"The phone was nice, but the used model sent came with a broken proximity sensor and the home button was a little funky. We returned it and went through Verizon for a brand new phone instead.",3
The shipping was on time. It said it would be here Friday by 8pm I got it Friday at 10am. Took the phone to Verizon to activate it and it works! Very pleased and very pleased with the price I paid for a good phone!,5
"Very pleased. I love it. I was expecting more scratches because of shipping but only one or two on back. A small dent on the top of the phone but not noticable in the picture. I would recommend getting this phone, you will not regret it!",5
"Well unfortunately my my phone went swimming and I was forced to decide between buying a new phone for $600 or buy a used one. I got an iPhone 5s in mint condition for less than $200 shipped to my door step in just a few days. Very pleased, would highly recommend this phone and for anybody facing the same situation as me",5
Phone came in mail pretty reasonably but the phone won't turn on or take a charge...seller obviously didn't check to make sure it worked before sending it out. They are based out of Brooklyn so I'm sure they are a lot of shady stores there.,1
This cell phone was easy to start up with Verizon. I bought this phone for my daughter who lives out of state so our family could stay connected. My daughter loves this phone.,5
"Bought this phone for my teenager after getting tired of spending ridiculous amounts of money on the ""latest and greatest"". I have had no regrets. The iPhone has worked great and saved me hundreds of dollars over the price of the latest iPhone.",5
"My husband got me this iPhone 5s for my birthday. I absolutely love it. The reason I'm only giving it 4/5 stars is because the charger port was just FILLED with lint and junk, affecting its ability to charge. My husband had to dig all the lint out with a safety pin.",4
"I'm super happy with my new phone, it works up to every standard and is fast. When I got the phone I noticed that there is very small wear and tear. Only one or two scratches on the screen but overall I couldn't have asked for a much better phone with this much space for this cheap",5
Apple IPhone 5S is working perfectly. No problem getting phone connected thru Verizon service and their free SIMM Card. Very happy with Amazon timely service also.Thank you.,4
"Awesome phone. Works perfect, great price point for brand new phone! Couldn't be happier. Customer service was world class. Will definitely buy here again.",5
It came quickly and the phone looks like its brand new. My only issue is that it does some weird things whenI try to use it while its charging. Other than that it works perfectly!,4
"I haven't had a lick of trouble when I got this phone. Not one. It works great, came with everything I needed it to come with, is just what I wanted. Great quality.",5
I'm not sure how I bought this phone for $350 with 64 gigabytes of internal memory but I did ........and it works perfectly on Verizon Wireless.....can't beat it........ came in great condition.....WIFE loves it.,5
I bought a refurbished phone and it came in on time. Works very well and since its a refurbished phone then there is still some very light scratched on the side but it doesn't bother me. Overall good buy. Nice camera quality!,5
"I was hesitant about buying this phone online, but it came better than expected. Clean with no scratches and works great. I inserted my SIM card and was using it instantly.",5
"So far so great! I was a little hesitate buying a refurbished phone, but I have had zero issues! It runs great, hardly any scratches or scuffs and the 64GB of storage is amazing compared to the 8GB of storage I had on my iPhone 4S. Really glad I found this awesome deal on Black Friday!",5
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It isn't a new phone. It is jailbroken into and then re-packaged to look new. I spent over 6 hours trying to get this phone to work with verizon only to find out it actually isn't brand new and was actually messed with. Don't buy!!,1
I bought this that the intention that it was new and never used. When i went and brought the phone to the verizon wireless and the phone was definitely already used and registered to another person and i had a problem transferring the phone to my plan.,2
"The online thing was that it did not come with the verizon Sim card like the description leads you to believe. Overall- VERY fast shipping! Phone is brand new as expected, now just to wait for the SIM card so I can enjoy it!",5
"iPhone's battery does not work properly! This was not included in the description. The battery died every 20 minutes unless it was connected to a charger. Once the phone would turn back on, it would say that the battery life was at 30%!",1
"I got this in the mail and it came with a little kit to clean the screen and then a REALLY nice screen protector. It was a nice little surprise. Anyways, I put a phone case on and it looks brand new! It also works great.",5
Phone is great! Everything is like it said in the description. Had to go to the I phone store for help setting up but that was a minor delay and it worked shortly after. The 30 day warranty was very re-assuring however I won't be returning this phone. Very happy thanks,5
"This phone is garbage. I've had it for less than three months and it's always having problems. Constantly freezing, kicking me out of apps, and dying way above 0% (yesterday it was at 43% when it decided to die).I had such high hopes for this seller and was very disappointed.",1
"Great form finish, metal and glass feel phenomenal. Cases don't add too much bulk due to already minimal dimensions. Fantastic phone& reliable operating system. Would definitely recommend even in 2016.",5
"Though the phone barely has any scratches or mishandling marks, the iPhone I received has a bad case of ghost tapping. Minus this annoying factor, the iPhone runs smoothly and the battery last as long as any other iPhone.",3
"The operating system failed within 4 months, beyond repair. The warranty with the seller was just 30 days. Very unfriendly return/exchange policy for an expensive item one expects to last at least a couple of years. SELLER/PRODUCT NOT RECOMMENDED.",1
"Although the phone itself was good, it turns out to be a non-verizon machine. which doesn't work with verizon simcard. I think they didn't test it. before selling.",1
I bought iphone5s in 2014. but yesterday my earphone was bad.I went to the Apple Store to repair earphone.They told me the earphone is not original earphone.I find I can not find any word in the earphone about Assembled in China.I think you sell me fake accessories！！！I think this is a very serious problem.,1
"Had an iPhone5, went to a Galaxy S5 (hated it), went back to iPhone (5S this time). Performance is noticeably better than the iPhone5 and SO much better than my S5 (especially after the Lollipop update). Battery life much better than S5, too. Love it!",5
"I got it for my out-of-town daughter, so aside from doing the initial setup, I really don't know how it's working out for her. But my brief experience with it was just fine.",5
"love the phone but not the battery. the battery was so damaged and abused that i had to go get it replaced. also, they sent me a nasty otterbox that was beyond the point of no return with how dirty it was.",3
"One star, only because I can't give it ZERO. The phone is a Japanese model, which is fine if you have to conform to Japanese laws. I'm not Japanese nor do I live in Japan. Right away I noticed several features I was unable to turn off because of the model of the phone. Entirely unhappy with this purchase.",1
"I'll give em a thumbs up. As I will say,they went above & beyond to resolve the error of receiving an incorrect item by error. Impressed with the customer service response & pleased with the product once received.",4
"Phone was in fair condition. The case had more scratches than originally suggested. For the price, however, a great purchase and delivered very quickly.",3
I'm real happy with my iPhone 5S it works great has a lot of features on it and I just upgraded me to a better phone I love the tracking system that Amazon offers you know exactly when you're going to receive it,5
"Bought this from Best Price Phones or kugs8989, in February - listed as NEW. Today, June 6, the battery is dead and will not hold a charge. Seller has disappeared. I've had the same model of phone since it was first issued in 2013, and it is still going strong.",1
"The screen had a couple of glitches with brightness initially, but it seems to have resolved and is working well. I would purchase a new phone with this seller again.",4
Major cons: (not negotiable)- speaker phone function is roughly 50% of how loud it needs to be. Makes listening to music or talking to people using the speaker pointless without headphones- Bluetooth function will not even display other devices to link to. Completely inoperable Bluetooth capabilityPros:-clean screen with little scratches or dings,1
"Purchased as ""used"" but it arrived in like-new condition complete with charger, cable, and ear buds. Been using the phone for several days now and it works exactly as expected. Out of the box, I had to charge it, then took it to the Verizon store where they verified the ESN was clean, and then installed a verizon sim card. No complaints at all.",5
"This is the first phone I've bought on Amazon. I was kind of leery but the phone came within 2 days, with an estimated 5 to 7 business day shipping expectation. The phone was Verizon ready, no scratches, chips, or any kind of damage on the phone. I love it. And would definitely recommend it.",5
Had an issue with finger print controls. Customer service outstanding they sent me another phone fast fast fast. Perfect phone. Love the newer features over iphone4,5
This does NOT work on Verizon!!!! Very disappointed and sent back immediately after taking to the Verizon store and being told it couldn't be activated.,1
"My iPhone arrived sealed in the box. Everything was perfect! I needed mine for Verizon Wireless, so I can't say if it was unlocked or not. The phone had all the accessories it was supposed to come with and everything works well. I am pleased!",5
"The phone turned out to be a Verizon phone, and was not ""unlocked"" to be used on other networks.This was definitely false advertizing and currently struggling to return it for full refund...do to traveling.",1
"I've had the top of the line Android phones and every single iphone ever and the iphone is the best phone there is and at this rate ever will be...whether it be because of design or performance, it's the better phone.",5
This product came in great with no scratches on it! The only issue I had was that I have to leave my cellular data turned on at all times in order for the iMessaging to work. (I just turn on the cellular data and shut it off for all the apps I have so they don't use up all my data),5
Great phone. Did not look used hardly at all. Worked very well. We just took the sim card from the old Verizon Samsung and put it in this one. Very seamless!,5
I bought iphone5s in 2014. but yesterday my earphone was bad.I went to the Apple Store to repair earphone.They told me the earphone is not original earphone.I find I can not find any word in the earphone about Assembled in China.I think you sell me fake accessories！！！I think this is a very serious problem.,1
"I'm still using this iphone now after purchasing it months ago, but the fingerprint unlocking mechanism stopped working less than a month in. It's a fine phone but I wish that aspect of it hadn't quit so soon.",4
"Be sure to check out to confirm the phone is fully working within the 30 days. If not, no refund or credit. We purchased a phone and it completely died within (6) months. Should have just bought it through my cell company. I feel for the price I paid, it should work a lot longer.",2
What can I say? The phone was FAKE. I took it to Verizon & they tried & tried. We were there for hours. End result- it's NOT A REAL IPHONE. This was my 12 year olds birthday gift.. Shame on these people.,1
"I was very nervous about buying an expensive item from Amazon, but I gave it a try and DO NOT regret it! I got my package in record time and it was exactly, if not better, than what I was hoping.",5
"I needed to upgrade my iPhone 4, and wasn't sure what to go with. Turns out I found a decent price in comparison, and it's everything I wanted and more. Love iPhone!",5
"Not too happy with this item. Say you can have connected with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile but no sim card came with it, price out rages, and can't get it hock up for a phone use. So very unhappy as it took a long time to try all the different cell phone companies and nothing unless we buy a Sims card and still nothing. This was bull.",2
Purchased this phone brand new and it's amazing better than I expected it to be. I had concerns that it wouldn't be as good as it looks but it was great and not sure why there are bad reviews about the company selling it?,5
"To start with when I took the phone into the store to get it switched with the old one the numbers off of the new box were not good. But when we got the phone out charged it and used the numbers off of it, it worked ok. So at first I was a little heaitant that it was real. It all worked out in the long run though.",4
"It's good, but not as like new as described in condition like new.I think described as very good condition is more reasonable because there are some black points in the back of the cellphone and little scratch in the side.Whatever I'm satisfied with the shopping with the price to get this phone.",3
"Phone was advertised as new, but was defective. Took it to the apple store and they said it came up on their computer as recycled. HMMMM Am having to return it.",1
I had ran into a problem with my phone just a week after i had it. i took it to the apple store and they said they couldn't do anything to it because it wasn't an Apple product. It was one of those fake phones from China. now i have to invest in another phone.,1
"The charging cord it came with sucks. It fried after a week of barely using it so that's really poor quality. Also, the phones volume button is jammed and I barely even use it. I use my earphones to adjust the volume. I wouldn't buy it again. I got it new and it's really causing me problems already.",2
"Product arrived quickly. Showed signs of minimal wear, just a slight rub mark from when it had been in a case. Was activated thru Verizon online account in a matter of minutes. Functions as expected. No complaints yet, only had it a few days tho. Came in non-factory box, included a new charger in good condition. Pleased with my order.",4
"Terrible. Phone took first charge to 100%. At 30% it went to 0 and turned off. Next charge to %100, then dead after 2 hours. It then wouldn't even take a charge. Garbage",1
"Haven't activated this phone yet, as it is a Christmas gift, but the phone is in great condition (as described). So far, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Will update this review, if it is necessary.Update: We absolutely love this phone and I am very satisfied with the purchase.",5
I bought this phone and then receive a iPhone 5! Not a 5s. Just a 5. I get it. The battery percentage is wrong so my phone shuts off at 35%. My touch screen lags and fidgets all the time. And my microphone hardly works. This company is terrible! Don't ever buy from them!!!,1
Apple IPhone 5S is working perfectly. No problem getting phone connected thru Verizon service and their free SIMM Card. Very happy with Amazon timely service also.Thank you.,4
"Awesome phone. Works perfect, great price point for brand new phone! Couldn't be happier. Customer service was world class. Will definitely buy here again.",5

"Phone arrived sooner than expected. Very clean, no signs of use. So far is working just fine. I use it for Page Plus Cellular and I was able to transfer my old number to this new phone without any problems. Great Phone.",5
"This has been a good purchase. The battery life isn't as good as we hoped. Sometimes it dies with 20% left to go. But for the price we got it, I didn't really expect it to be perfect. Other than that, there have been no problems.",4
"Bought this from Best Price Phones or kugs8989, in February - listed as NEW. Today, June 6, the battery is dead and will not hold a charge. Seller has disappeared. I've had the same model of phone since it was first issued in 2013, and it is still going strong.",1

Every function on the phone works well however Bluetooth and wireless are broken. Tried several reboots with the software so it must be a hardware issue. Very disappointing. Not worth the $300+ I paid for it.,2
"Phone worked great for like two weeks. Turns out it wasn't brand new at all, screen started ghost clicking and when I took it to the apple store to use the ""warranty"" it comes with they said it wasn't even new and the warranty wouldn't cover it.",1
"I do not know if these reviews are seller specific but I order the phone from ""Next Level Mobile"" which was labeled as ""new"" after around 3.5 months the display was not working, when I brought it to Apple they said they could not fix the problem because it has been replaced with a ""third party display"".",1
"So far so great! I was a little hesitate buying a refurbished phone, but I have had zero issues! It runs great, hardly any scratches or scuffs and the 64GB of storage is amazing compared to the 8GB of storage I had on my iPhone 4S. Really glad I found this awesome deal on Black Friday!",5
"just get the phone ,almost brandnew, no any scratch on the screen or back cover, love it, better then the iPhone 4 what i bought last year. btw, the cable and earphone are orighnal as well, not the cheap copy.",5
Thrilled to have this iPhone! Still learning how to use it with ALL the features. Don't know what your missing until you have it in your hot little hand. Wonderful machine.,5
"The quality of the product was actually better than I expected, and the delivery also arrived earlier than the projected date which was a plus for me.",5
"It was perfect, with a little defecto on the screen, but they offered yo resolve the problem with 0 Cost, I'm from Argentina, so I left it like this and my san didn't note it. For now, It's everything ok!",4
"Great experience. Product way much better than advertised and expected. I ordered a very good item and received a brand new product. Excellent seller, 200% recommended.",5
This phone works great! Fast shipping was unlocked and just popped my SIM card right in. Definently recommend for anyone in a hurry for a new phone. Much easier than trying to find one in Craigslist or Letgo.,5
the phone is used refurbished not in new condition which someone else had used. other than that needs to put this on the add. phone is fine. beware . found out when we took in the att. oh well live and learn should have read the reviews before we purchased..,3
"The screen was scratched quite a bit. I expected that of the casing but not of the screen since, it seems that everybody uses a screen protector now a days. The rest was fine.",3
"I phone 5S was used and with water damage. Purchased phone 4 months ago it was stated ""new"". It stop holding a charge. Took it to Apple and they were able to see that the contact liquid indicator was tampered with indicating water damage and based on the serial # it was activated in 2014 !",1
"It was perfect, with a little defecto on the screen, but they offered yo resolve the problem with 0 Cost, I'm from Argentina, so I left it like this and my san didn't note it. For now, It's everything ok!",4
"Ordered a brand new apple iphone 5s factory unlocked ., item came in an OPENED box without charger and the item doesn't look like brand new having lots of dust on it.",1
Do NOT buy This phone it was not unlocked as it said. It would NOT work with Verizon yet seller stated it would. I spent 1 hour 38 minutes with Verizon trying to figure it out. They called apple and Apple would not unlock it. The phone will NOT work with Verizon.,1
"I had to take this phone in after owning it for 3 months (kept in a life-proof case). I was told by Apple that it was a refurbished phone, the screen is loose, and I am having software problems. This was not a new phone as advertised.",1
These guys are awesome! The phone was just as described: brand new factory GSM unlocked iPhone 5s 16gb! They even included a screen protector! I would definitely purchase something again from them!,5
"Extremely dissatisfied, we received the phone and have had constant issues, we received the blue screen of death multiple times, the phone refuses to charge, randomly shuts off, the screen will become unresponsive. DO NOT BUY YOUR PHONE FROM THESE PEOPLE!",1
"This phone was sold as new but after three months of use I got blue screen, was told by apple that the phone is refurbished and had the same problem, not honest, false advertisement.",1
Ordered 2. Excellent phone but needed to return one because grandaughter decided to keep old phone and they would not let me return because past return date. Will never order from these people again!,1
"Please Don't Buy it. I bought it and gifted it to my father. He could not use it for 3 months. Local i center told the phone was repaired three times before sold. Total treachery. So please, please dont buy it.",1
It works just like it's supposed to only problem is for payment it doesn't take my visa and the camera on the inside doesn't work so that's very upsetting.,4
A good phone overall looks as described. No scratches on the front whatsoever. Also here a day earlier than estimated time. If you are looking for a phone with an acceptable price you should try this! Also functional.,4
I helped buy this phone for my boyfriend and he has no complaints about it even though it was previously owned. It is in excellent condition and honestly i wouldnt have been able to tell it was used if it didnt say so.,5
"Much smaller than I expected, but still the product is high-end, you can tell it is well-made, with good materials.The seller was top-notch, and the product is being used in Argentina, so it is genuinely unlocked to use internationally with any GSM company.",4
"The screen was scratched quite a bit. I expected that of the casing but not of the screen since, it seems that everybody uses a screen protector now a days. The rest was fine.",3
"Great experience. Product way much better than advertised and expected. I ordered a very good item and received a brand new product. Excellent seller, 200% recommended.",5
This phone works great! Fast shipping was unlocked and just popped my SIM card right in. Definently recommend for anyone in a hurry for a new phone. Much easier than trying to find one in Craigslist or Letgo.,5
"This phone is in like new condition as far as I can tell, works great and holds a good charge. No issues with its unlocked status. (I'm using it on TMobile.) Delivery was prompt to Amazon Locker.",5
It works great. It hasn't overheated or the battery isn't damaged like the other reviews said. I was scared to buy it at first because of the reviews but it hasn't had any problems.,5
"This phone states it is AT&T compatible and unlocked but AT&T could not activate the phone, said that Verizon would have to unlock it.I purchased 8 for a business and probably will have to return them all. Called the seller and they gave me a song and dance abouthow I could unlock the phone. If it is advertised unlocked, it should be unlocked.",1

"Works great!! Wasn't the exact color as I thought it would be but it's okay. Came in freshly new, the sim card was attached and it worked; I just love it. Exactly how it said in the description. Would buy from this seller again (:",5
"I though this IPhone 5s is ready to use where ever I want but I'm so disappointed.I brought that Phone with me to Cambodia to use as my pleasure but it was lock the code.I was told that phone is ready to use but it too bad I have to bring that phone back to US to retrieve that,",1
"Don't buy.Bought this for my husband bout 3 months ago,And his phone is all messed up like the phone keeps restarting and the screen turns blue u can't do any Thing on it, and can't return it or replace cause return day is up :/Pay the extra money for a phone.",1
"I received the iPhone 5S but when I got it there was not a SIM card, there is a SIM card number but no actual Sim card as the description said there was.",1
I got this so fast…..It is everything I wanted…it was easy to set up! I would recommend this to people who have had trouble with cell phones….it's a pleasure having a nice one!,5
The phone works great but when I tried to activate the SIM card the phone went into an endless loop. Now I have to wait for Straight Talk to send me a new sim so I can actually use the phone as a phone instead of a very expensive iPod touch. Not happy.,1
"I never got any information on how to activate the phone, it ask for a sim card, only i dont know which one to get. It was suppose to come with instructions. As of right now im waiting for a reply from the company. Phone looks good tho.",2
Great Phone ! Only problem was and still is the service. This phone is Verizon towers but through straight talk. It won't let me text on iMessage or get on Internet without wifi. But the phone itself is great with wonderful pictures. Just make sure you fight hard to get a good service,4
Arrived very quickly even though it was the holidays. Everything promised was in the box. Item works perfectly. I would purchase from this vendor again.,5
The condition of the phone was awesome. But the battery can be on 50% and it will die. So I am probably going to be spending money to have they battery replaced.,3
Came with no hardware and the hooks are not even attach. I have to figure out a way to attach all and how to hang it up. Bad quality. Only gave a star bc I have no other choice.,1
"Terrible. Got the phone it was advertised as new but when I tried to activate it i couldn't because it had a previous owner and i didnt have the icloud password for it. So I can't use it. I called apple and they said it was nothing they could do. Needless to say, I'm getting my money back.",1
Very disappointed when I tried to use it was told by straight talk will only work with AT&T towers or t mobile towers nothing about Verizon towers with the description says it will work with probably won't be buying another phone from amazon and I love amazon,1
"they sold me a phone claimed it was NEW and it wasn't new it was activated in Jan 2015, I purchased it in August 2015 the phone has had a hardware malfunction and when I called apple support this is how I learned my phone was out of warranty because it had been activated in Jan so that is the date apple has on file>>>>>BUY BEWARE!!!!!",1
I had an great experience with the exception I received my package a day later than the original date. Also was a Lil disappointed it didn't come with a house charger which I thought all phone did. Overall I had no problems with phone.,4
Phone is in good condition. Small scratches on the back in the form of someone's a initials. Which is hilarious to me. Doesn't come with phone charger or head phones.,4
Phone works perfect came in great shape but that charger was broken I tested it on my bother 5s so I gotta give 4 star because I spend extra money charge.,4

A good phone overall looks as described. No scratches on the front whatsoever. Also here a day earlier than estimated time. If you are looking for a phone with an acceptable price you should try this! Also functional.,4
"Please Don't Buy it. I bought it and gifted it to my father. He could not use it for 3 months. Local i center told the phone was repaired three times before sold. Total treachery. So please, please dont buy it.",1
I helped buy this phone for my boyfriend and he has no complaints about it even though it was previously owned. It is in excellent condition and honestly i wouldnt have been able to tell it was used if it didnt say so.,5
"Much smaller than I expected, but still the product is high-end, you can tell it is well-made, with good materials.The seller was top-notch, and the product is being used in Argentina, so it is genuinely unlocked to use internationally with any GSM company.",4
"The screen was scratched quite a bit. I expected that of the casing but not of the screen since, it seems that everybody uses a screen protector now a days. The rest was fine.",3
"This phone is in like new condition as far as I can tell, works great and holds a good charge. No issues with its unlocked status. (I'm using it on TMobile.) Delivery was prompt to Amazon Locker.",5
"I had to take this phone in after owning it for 3 months (kept in a life-proof case). I was told by Apple that it was a refurbished phone, the screen is loose, and I am having software problems. This was not a new phone as advertised.",1
These guys are awesome! The phone was just as described: brand new factory GSM unlocked iPhone 5s 16gb! They even included a screen protector! I would definitely purchase something again from them!,5
"Extremely dissatisfied, we received the phone and have had constant issues, we received the blue screen of death multiple times, the phone refuses to charge, randomly shuts off, the screen will become unresponsive. DO NOT BUY YOUR PHONE FROM THESE PEOPLE!",1
the phone is used refurbished not in new condition which someone else had used. other than that needs to put this on the add. phone is fine. beware . found out when we took in the att. oh well live and learn should have read the reviews before we purchased..,3
"I phone 5S was used and with water damage. Purchased phone 4 months ago it was stated ""new"". It stop holding a charge. Took it to Apple and they were able to see that the contact liquid indicator was tampered with indicating water damage and based on the serial # it was activated in 2014 !",1
"It was perfect, with a little defecto on the screen, but they offered yo resolve the problem with 0 Cost, I'm from Argentina, so I left it like this and my san didn't note it. For now, It's everything ok!",4
"Save yourself the headache. I got this ""New Verizon Wireless"" phone in the mail. For one, it didnt even have the headphones in the box. Just an empty case for them. I couldn't even activate the phone on Verizon Wireless because it is not a Verizon Wireless phone. Hoping to return and get a refund. Talk about false advertisement!!",1
The phone is great! Exactly how I thought it would be and it is a unopened seal. The only issues is the earbuds broke the first day I used them and the charger isn't the best.,4
Nobody can hear my voice when I have a conversation.. Bindi mobile says they will replace it but that means I have to ship it back and be without a phone for some time.. Not really happy..,2
Very disappointed. I had purchased an iPhone on Amazon once before with no problems but this time the phone was defective. I returned it for repair only to have it come back worse than before. Now I have to pay for repairs myself.,2
"The phone had a crack. On the back that was not listed on the description. It did say normal wear and tear, but I think a crack is more than normal when you pay that much for a used phone, you expect the truth.",2
Phone shipped fast but when we received the phone and fully charged it the ear speaker does not work. We are attempting to contact seller to get this issue resolved. Will update review at,2
I'm not a techie buti am very happy to have finally upgraded to a newer iPhone. the phone came very quickly and with no dofficulties goung through customs.,5
It is perfect screen，but few clash marks on the frame。The iphone is unlocked，and warranty available over june 。It is delivered fast，only spent 10days got it since paid。,4
"Great condition. Small dents at the corners but barely visible. Screen perfect. Headphones, charger are good. I gave 4 star because I ordered gold and got space grey. I was disappointed but this one is in great condition so I just lived with it.",4
"The product was as described. Brand new and sealed with shrink wrap. Charger, manuals, and stickers were all included. Phone is in perfect working order. Would definitely recommend this seller to anyone looking to purchase an off contract brand new iPhone without paying full retail price.",5
This phone is fantastic! Have had it a little over 2 months now and no complaints. It arrived on time and looked exactly as advertised. I had no problems getting it turned on with Verizon. My daughter loves it!,5
My phone is defective.. I can hardly use it while it's charging. The space button and send button are screwed up. It's like a repeat of the iPhone 4 except I paid 219$ for this..,2
"Bought an iPhone 5s after I lost my previous one, arrived the next day, and functions perfectly. No noticeable dints, or scratches on the phone. Bought a ""refurbished"" one.",5
"I made a very specific search for VERIZON compatible phones and this states IN THE PRODUCT TITLE that it is a verizon compatible phone.. go to get it activated, it's not compatible! thank you for wasting my time and money.",1
"I was nervous about buying a used phone but I am extremely happy with my purchase.Shipping : Came as planned, easy to open packagingPrice: Pretty much what the going rate was on craigslist and other sites - competitive pricingQuality of the item: Just as described , "" Like New "" no obvious damage or scratches. Looks new to me",5
"My phone works perfectly. The speakers carry high quality sound. Because it works as it should, I get to enjoy all the benefits of a quality product without worrying about problems.",5

"This product came on the exact day that it was estimated, and I am very happy about this! I definitely recommend to anyone looking for an Iphone. Friendly service as well. Thank you so much!!!",5
Regretfully the phone was beautiful but I needed a Verizon carrier phone and when we opened up the Sim card we found out it was AT&T and we couldn't make it work it was returned as per instructions and Amazon refunded my money immediately.,3
Received my phone on the the day it was supposed to Arrive. I've been using it for a few days and it works perfect. Oh and the phone was in great condition.,5
"Sprint refused to activate this phone on a pre-paid plan. We ended up returning it. The phone itself appeared unused and in the original box. However, it did not have the Apple factory seal on the box so was apparently not ""new"".",2
"This phone was horrible. Within a few months, it was completely useless. It glitches out all the time, I couldn't even write a text message. Huge waste of money.",1
This phone is the right size and as is fast!! It was purchased for my son's birthday. He is happy with this phone. My son prefers the smaller phones and this works for him as some larger ones like the iPhone 6 and 7 are too big for his taste.,5
"Works great! Does not uncles SIM card but you can purchase one online or through a phone call. Perfect screen. Very minimal marks on the back, but if you use a case it looks brand new.",5
"This Iphone product didn't meet my expectations at all. There were many damages around the phone casing, and the main speaker, on the front screen, wasn't working properly. Also the phone over-heats; not to mention the battery life drains faster than usual.",1
"Came with one charging cable, and the phone. No box or anything, but I don't need any more apple boxes on my shelves. I saved a lot of money, and would buy from these fellas and gals again..",5
I purchased this phone and had contact with seller to make sure it's a att phone. They said yes. Well went to att and it's not an att phone. They checked it and it will not accept simple card from att.,1
Phone looks great does as expected. Sadly the battery is useless. After fully charging it still dies within two hours. Now that should have been stated in the sale listing too. Now off to buy a battery!!! I don't like dishonesty or failure to disclose. especially when it comes to this sort of item.,2
I wish I could give this 0 stars.The phone is dirty and cracked up. It looks like its been through hell and back.This phone has water damage and the screen is blur.I demand a refund this is going back.,1
I ordered the phone on the Monday night (the night I broke my phone and couldn't use it) and it arrived on Friday. The phone looks great and works well. Thank you for your swift service and delivery.,5
"Got this for my daughter for her birthday, was listed as good condition but it was practically brand new just didn't have a box. Super fast shipping! Thank you",5
Awesome Used Product.. No Flaw except some hazy look on screen when its screen is off.. Outer body dont have a single scratch and phone is running without any issue,4
I was skeptical about ordering a used iPhone but I am thrilled with the phone I received. It is in perfect condition and exactly as advertised. Not a flaw on it that I can see. The SIM card from my old phone was too big. I took it to an ATT store and they cut it to fit. No charge. My phone was working the same day I received it.,5
Overall a nice little phone though the antennae seems a little week to me. I was up in the mountains near my home and my sons cheap go phone had better reception. Both phones are AT&T...,4
"Came as claimed. Near flawless condition... I couldn't find anything wrong with it if I tried. Only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum... No apple logo or and writing, at all. But it grew on me its very sleek. Phone operates as expected and is lightning fast. I would suggest to anyone.",5
"Appearance of the phone was perfect, unfortunately after 93 days of ownership the video blew out. There was no physical damage to the phone, it just stopped functioning and does not appear repairable.",1
"No complaints, people should read and understand what they going to buy before they start complaining, got my phone in very good condition, for the price and very honest services..",5
"Phone was in excellent condition. The price and the quality of the device are unparalleled to any other phone product on Amazon. I would not only reuse this service if needed, but would recommend to anyone that asked.",5
Its permanently locked to Sprint and I am travelling to a different country. Now I am not able to use it as its locked.This information was missing during the time of purchase.,1
I was a little skeptical at first but once I received the phone and activated I was incredibly happy with what I bought I recommend this seller to anybody looking to buy an iPhone on amazon. 5 start quality for sure,5
"When I got my iPhone it was in new condition, but the iPhone was defective, the phone would do a blue screen loop, and then put itself into recovery mode every single night, when I went to go recover it, halfway it would fail. Thankfully the iPhone had the 1 year warranty still I'm effect, so I brought it to the apple store and got a new iPhone.",5
Phone sold as new was not had been activated 6 months early and we could not activate through apple or iTunes. Theregote I feel time snd money wasted.,1
Bought the new iphone to try it so far so good. It really isnt TOO GREAT i have been using other phones like the Xperia Z2 although Iphone 5S has some cool new features like the fingerprint scanner it isnt really something that changes the game.... It is the kind of features that u use the first time u buy the phone and then forget about,3
I really like the iphone 5S. It is my first and only smart phone so I can't judge it according to other makes. The learning curve is terrible an Apple does't tell you much about using it even starting. They assume you know the basics of smart phones apparently. Amazon Warehouse were excellent to do business with.,5
Overall it's a good productBut I did see some minor blemishes such as scratches also the screen was popped out in one corner but the technology was fine,3
before ordering the iphone 5s i was like man whats the point of touch id it sounds like a stupid gimmick. in reality its a great tool for phone security because people don't see you put in your password. I also like that it's faster to log into my phone.,5
"i could not insert a nano sim chip then i do not know if works. I noticed that if you buy the 64 GB from the apple store for Tmobile is cheaper than this one, also is unlocked. I didn't know about that.",3
"Good phone performs like it should.but calls have static sometimes but it goes away but phone was in awesome condition , very happy I would recommend. Fast shipping too I needed the phone.",5
phone did not work properly. we had to take it to ATT store. the #1 button would not work on keyboard. they had to replace the glass $110. now it works fine. pretty disappointing. It was shipped to my daughter in college and there was no time to send it back and get another one.,1
"I bought it as new but when i get it today and opened it it was used and broken, i did not activated it yet going to do it tomorrow hope it will work i am very upset.",1
"this phone was in great shape when I got it and was exactly as they said! I was worried about it being broken or defective, but the phone is working great and I have absolutely no problems :)",5
This phone is absolutely amazing & this is the first iPhone I've ever had :). The battery is better than Android because I only need to charge it every 2 days instead of everyday. It's very well designed & I'll stick with Apple for a very long time haha.,3
I'am very satisfied with purchasing my new phone. Everything described was exactly true about the conditions of the phone which looks practically new. I would reccomend anyone to get their phone with them :),5
So far this phone has been exactly what I wanted it for! It was nice to get an Iphone for a lower price and not have to shell out the big bucks!A few times the phone has had some glitches but it worked after restarting it. But overall what I wanted!!,4
Phone works and was in really good condition the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I ordered a silver iphone and recieved the space grey iphone.,4
"A friend asked me to order this item, the phone came with no charger, screen corners are darker than usual, ICCID says unknown and I paid $189 for this. I want my money back ASAP, pleassse somebody.",1
It was great. Has worked well. but I would like to kindly request for the name that was attached to the sprint account. It is equested for the unlocking of the device. Please contact on my email ubong21@gmail.com,4
I purchased a iPhone5s and the description said it was unlocked. At&t says it is not unlocked and will not release the phone to consumer cellular. I will be returning the phone today and looking to purchase somewhere else.,1
Ok I bought this iPhone now I can't activate it I am desipointed . I need this unlock now they say that there is no unlock code for this phone .pls if u are buying an iPhone make sure it is unlock this was s wast of my time and money. I am KENDAL HANNA a dissatisfied customer,1
"Brand new in sealed box, as promised. Minor complaint -- this must be from a foreign market, because the charger and brick in the box is not a US plug. Seller included a US plug in the amazon box, but its a generic charging cable and brick, not apple. Otherwise, very happy with the product.",5
"One of three phones I bought this month from Amazon third-party because of ""drowned"" phones. This was one was as described (or better). Shipping was very fast! Very satisfied so far!",5
"After some issues, not by the seller, the Item was as described. It's perfect! And they gave me a car charger and two phones cases for the mishap. Thank you!",5
"When this phone arrived, it either wasn't unlocked or wasn't an ATT compatible phone which is what we supposedly bought. It won't activate on our line which makes it basically pointless.",1
"The product is marked as like new, but the mobilephone i received screen scratches.And the top of the screen will be dented with a little strength,use my hand.",3
My new iphone 5s arrived ahead of schedule. My iphone 5s arrived in very good condition without any incidents. The price was just right.Now I can purchase my iwatch. Thanks James Thom,5
"I did not realize that the phone was not unlocked and made ​​the mistake to buy it for the Sprint company. I live in Argentina , and wanted to know if you know any way to unlock it or I can send some code to do it?",4
Shh .. This is a Christmas Gift from Santa Clause! This phone arrived before the due date & get this .. It came with EXTRAS that wasn't even mentioned or known! I was exstatic when I opened the package & saw everything so I definitely know my recipient of this gift will be too!!!,5
"This phone has been exactly what I expected and wanted. Moreover, the seller was fantastic, did a great job of transferring the phone, packing and shipping securely and promptly.",5
"My wife's iPhone 4 died and she wanted a new one, but didn't want to commit to another 2-year contract. I bought this new from Amazon for $250 less than what Sprint would charge me.",5
"This was a upgrade from the 5c. The only issue i had was that this phone did not come with a SIM card, but the nice guy i called at ATT told me what to do, and this phone works like a charm! i am SO happy!The phone was in excellent shape, one minor blemish that is easily ignored (or covered with a sparkly phone case).",5
This phone works great at first I thought it was defective because it would not turn on but I found out that the lock switch was on which would not let the phone charge or turn on after I turned that off the phone works like brand new great deal for the price,5
The phone came in alright condition. It has scratches and dings on. BUT it does not come with a SIM and it is not clearly noted on the description. Make sure you have a SIM because it's a huge pain to get one! Two to three weeks shipping for me.,3
"Amazing phone. I woke up the next morning after using the phone, I named her Siri; and she made me coffee. I come home from work and all my clothes are folded and put away nicely. What an amazing phone the 5S is. The only problem is we can't take a shower together, something about the water Siri doesn't like. I love my 5S. <3",5
Very disapionted as I'm in Australia and the fone can't be used I understood fone locked for sprint but would axept overseas sim for use out side the states stuck with a fone that the carriers won't unlock,1
This phone has worked great for me for two years now. I also hate cases and have dropped it a thousand times preparing myself for the worst when I pick it up and it's still in great condition.,5
"The phone I got was highly used, many dinks on the side. the front touch screen was replaced with after market junk. The touch screen stopped working after two weeks. The wifi and LTE data also slowed to a crawl. I don't recommend a used iPhone.",1
"Very good used iphone 5s. Product came exactly as described in product details. Good batter life, cosmetic condition. And shipping was fast after an initial wait period.",5
"Shipped perfectly. Using flawlessly for months on end. Would suggest buying a SIM card with it unless you live close to a Spring store, I had to make three trips to get it working properly. However, that isn't the buyer's fault, Sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10",5
I was very excited to receive the phone in a short amount of time and to see it was basically brand new and had some charge in it so I could activate it right away! I was also very happy that it came with not 1 but 2 chargers!,5
I was hoping this wouldn't be a crApple product but after less than 2 months of use the phone shuts off randomly & as of lately refusing to boot up for hours.This is absolutely disgusting.,1
I ordered another IPhone before this one & was given one with scratches & the lock screen did not work. This one came as explained in the bio! Works great came in mint condition I love my IPhone!,5
"I needed to recieve this by Christmas as a gift for my boyfriend and did! The seller has great communication via email, and inturn was able to provide ideal customer service. The product is working great and my boyfriend had the best christmas ever. Thank you!",5
"I bought this iphone the other day and I am absolutely in love. Everything came as described. I had the iphone 4s prior to this phone and was inneed of a upgrade, Im very satisfied with the iphone 5s, battery lasts much longer and the camera is way better on this phone. I recommend people to order this phone from here, it really is worth it!",5
"I love my phone and it is in great condition but it is an Iphone 5 not a 5S and I payed for a 5S not a 5. The shipping and the quality of the phone was great, but I wanted a 5S.",2
"Phone I got was in decent visual condition. However, battery does not last with more than 1 hour of use. Also, after 3 days the speaker stopped working. Buyer beware, these are junk refurbished phones.",1
"Very undone. Speaker was blown, front facing had to replaced as well as the battery after I found out it was an aftermarketed replacement that was too thick for the facing to seat correctly. Overall spent over $200 to have it in basic standings",1
There wasn't a SIMS card with it. Which my have been my fault for not double checking out reading through everything. I'm not sure they advertised no SIM card though. But it was in great shape and exactly what I was looking for. No scratches or problems either. Also the charger they sent me didn't work.,3
"Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service.",1
Ordered three of these phones and non of them would connect to Sprint's network. Sprint told me that they were incompatible with their system. They were also not new phones and were refurbished.,1
I have not even had this phone for a month and now the home button does not work!! Have not dropped it I don't know why it just stopped working from one day to the next very disappointed!! Also the screen on the side looks like it is about to pop out any minute!!,1
"Recently purchased this iPhone about 1 month or 2 months ago, sometimes it decides not to charge and then screen frezzes. its a ""NEW"" iPhone but its giving me problems..",3
"this item arrived perfectly fine, on time and it looked great on the outside but the part where it charges the phone was old, moldy and burnt, and there is no way to fix it. I wasted $250.",1
IT was not totally fine. It has a rattle like the insides don't quite fit tightly. I am having some issues with it not responding to internet quickly. But this does not happen all the time.,3
"I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED!",1
Ordered this as a gift for my daughter's 17th birthday and so far she's in love with it. Everything was as described and it even arrived earlier than expected!,5
"Was advertised as a refurbished phone. But it was used not refurbished. Refurbished almost always have a new shell. But are to definitely be fully tested. More rigorous testing than new products. However, this phone was scratched up. And microphone is not working at 100%. As others he me as muffled.",2
"This was an amazing upgrade for us since we were still using a 3Gs. I would prefer a more solid battery, and I wish that voice control/siri could function w/o internet access but other than that; it's a good product at this price point.",4
"Paid almost $20 extra for overnight shipping, phone came 4 days later, plugged in the charger n it started smoking. Phone it's self was as advertised and works fine just wish it was a better overall experience.",3
"Came as advertised, put in the SIM Card, registered phone with provider, syncd with ITunes and was up in no time at all. Was a new locked phone for Sprint and couldn't have worked any better. Quick delivery, excellent product and I couldn't be happier.",5
"My apologies - I didn't know that my phone is synced with my hearing aids - and, therefore, ""blue tooth"" is on all the time. So, that is causing the battery to run down faster than I'm used to. The phone is just fine and the vendor was most cooperative.",4
"I bought this Iphone because I wanted to use it in Mexico but it doesn't work, on the website description said that It just works in US just with sprint but in others countries it would work totally fine like Mexico, so I would like to return it.",1
"This item came very fast. I was disappointed when they told me it will arrive in a week, but so happy and overwhelmed when it arrived in two days without PRIME connection. The iPhone works perfectly and don't regret purchasing. Best thing I've bought!",5
"Mine works perfectly! I have yet to find any scratches on the screen, so it's in great condition! Plus, I have over 2500 songs and tons of apps on my phone now and I still have about 38 GB of free space! I am EXTREMELY pleased!",5
"The phone was shipped quickly, however I received the iPhone 5 instead of the 5s model that the title and description state it is. Needed a new phone as soon as possible so I didn't return the item. It works great and looked brand new. I'm just disappointed I didn't get what I thought I was paying for.",3
Was doing really good. Now this week my screens are freezing up i have to push home button and turn back on to get messages or my square. sometimes freezes up while i am using it. is a pain to use square to collect money for my sales and turn off and on couple of times to complete a transaction.,3
Great phone! I've had the 4 and the 4s and the 5s is amazing! So slim and fast and there is definitely a BIG difference in the phone compared to the 4/4s. Absolutely love apple and iOS 7. And I'm in love with the gold color!,5
"I have sold my Apple iPhone 5s 16GB, as I needed an UNBLOCKED unit, and although I thought I was bying an unblocked version, it turned out that I wasn't. I have since acquired the same machine, here in South Africa, and it is the best thing that I have ever acquired!!!!",1
"I'm writing this review after using the phone over a year. It was easy to hook up w sprint right out of the box, and has been working well for me since Dec 2015. I can upgrade to a new phone now but haven't because there is no need -this refurbished phone still functions without noticeable hiccups.",5
Item was ok.WARNING: IT does not come with a SIM card. Must have a SIM card from the carrier to be able to activate/ use it. Had to order a nano SIM card to make it work (still waiting on those to be delivered),2
I purchased the phone used for $350 and have been using it for the past month. I recommend the phone at this price point.Pros:Good cameraTouch ID is accurate and convenientGood 4 inch sizeFast processorPurchased 1 year used and it still works wellIt runs iOS 8.1Cons:Home button works but has a small clicking sound.No Apple pay/ NFC,5
It was unblocked and never been unblocked. Charger was so dirty and disgusting! I could not finalize talk to seller who promised to unlock the phone but never did,1
bought this used from amazon. was worried about it not working or missing a cable but it came with new everything except an apple box. sure beats buying a new one for close to $1000. works great and its new to me.,5
"Phone is a bit more quirky than I'd hoped, touchscreen seems to lose letters and motions here and there, but I think that's just iOS8 being weird, hopefully it'll get better with the next update.",4
This is a great phone. iPhone 5S is a great phone. Can do many things. Like multi-tasking is great. The #5 version is a stronger and very popular to work. The pictures are the most easiest for a touch phone. And much faster then the iPhone 4. Try it I think you would like it. I recently bought this for a friend of mine. And she thinks its great.,5
"This was a upgrade from the 5c. The only issue i had was that this phone did not come with a SIM card, but the nice guy i called at ATT told me what to do, and this phone works like a charm! i am SO happy!The phone was in excellent shape, one minor blemish that is easily ignored (or covered with a sparkly phone case).",5
Terrible! It is a Sprint phone and they couldn't turn it on. I tried to return it but never heard back from the seller. Then I tried to unlock it and have T-Mobile turn it on. They couldn't do it either. This was a waste of my money!!!!,1
Works and arrived as advertised. I feel the the motherboard was scrapped from a 4s because it shows up on AT&T and iTunes as a 4s. I crossed-checked the serial number through Apple and it says it is a 5s so the controlling component must have been from a 4s. Other than that I'm happy with the purchase.,4
This is the second time I've bought an iPhone online. I wish I'd known about this company the first time around. The phone is exactly as it was described! It works and looks perfect! Would absolutely buy from them again! Thank you so much!,5
The phone is beautiful. However i only had a couple of problems with it. The top left corner is glitchy and there is a red dot on the lcd display when turned on. Other than that the phone is perfect. I would buy from this seller again.,3
"Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service.",1
Ordered three of these phones and non of them would connect to Sprint's network. Sprint told me that they were incompatible with their system. They were also not new phones and were refurbished.,1
"the phone speakers broke after a month and a half. do not buy from them. they are a 3rd party who ""fixes"" phones with tape to hold parts together. buying from them was the biggest mistake of my life. i thought they were posing as apple and sold me a crapy phone. THEY ARE FAKE!!!! DO NOT TRUST THEM!!!!",1
I really really LOOVVEEE this iPhone ! 😍😍 thank you soooooooooooooooo much ! I couldn't ask for Better . and for a cheap price ? this is excellent . it looks brand new but you have to buy your own charger and box AND headphones but the phone is still worth it ! make sure you charge the phone before you deliver it though . :/,5
"I love my phone and it is in great condition but it is an Iphone 5 not a 5S and I payed for a 5S not a 5. The shipping and the quality of the phone was great, but I wanted a 5S.",2
"Phone I got was in decent visual condition. However, battery does not last with more than 1 hour of use. Also, after 3 days the speaker stopped working. Buyer beware, these are junk refurbished phones.",1
"It's really good! But sometimes, it doesn't find good signal! I don't know why... If it's the cellphone, or if it's the carrier! The product is amazing, what I had found",4
We are very satisfied with our purchase. The dealer answered questions promptly and communicated with professionalism. would definitely recommend people purchase from this site and this dealer. will be purchasing again soon. Product exceeded my expectations. very satisfied.,5
currently very very pleased with this phone!! i bought it refurbished and it is like brand new. i have had no problems so far and hope i don't have to encounter any.,5
"Phone does not say percentage by the battery, caused me problems when I was restoring it. Charger is FAKE. Not pleased because of that. The phone is also causing me problems with music. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate the phone a 6.",3
"I have had some erratic incidents that I had not had with my previous 5s. Eventually they went away, but it has caused me to question the product or the source a bit.",3
"As far as the iPhone goes I like it. As far as this particular one, the screen is sometimes unresponsive requiring a restart. Not cool.update. downgrading to one star. it quit on me last night. it is still on, but the screen wont come on. am having to return it and I cant even wipe it before i do. not cool.",1
The phone has been to the AT&T store twice and help from Apple Support . It may have serious problems. Not sure iif I should send it back or give it more time.,2
"Good price. Phone is immaculate. Fast delivery. No issues. Love the phone, much better than the 5c I had. Touch ID is a nice feature. Wonderful camera.",5
"Great, connection is lost at times but maybe the connection is due to ATT. Didn't come with charger like supposed to. But works great. Came charged. Almost new.",4
"Very good used iphone 5s. Product came exactly as described in product details. Good batter life, cosmetic condition. And shipping was fast after an initial wait period.",5
"The phone did not come unlocked as advertised. When the package was delivered, it was stated in the bill that was locked onto the AT&T Network, not Factory Unlocked as advertised.",3
Ok I bought this iPhone now I can't activate it I am desipointed . I need this unlock now they say that there is no unlock code for this phone .pls if u are buying an iPhone make sure it is unlock this was s wast of my time and money. I am KENDAL HANNA a dissatisfied customer,1
"Brand new in sealed box, as promised. Minor complaint -- this must be from a foreign market, because the charger and brick in the box is not a US plug. Seller included a US plug in the amazon box, but its a generic charging cable and brick, not apple. Otherwise, very happy with the product.",5
"Good phone performs like it should.but calls have static sometimes but it goes away but phone was in awesome condition , very happy I would recommend. Fast shipping too I needed the phone.",5
phone did not work properly. we had to take it to ATT store. the #1 button would not work on keyboard. they had to replace the glass $110. now it works fine. pretty disappointing. It was shipped to my daughter in college and there was no time to send it back and get another one.,1
"Arrived early and came as described (minor imperfections on back surface). My sister lost her previous sprint iPhone & this is for her birthday! Hopefully, easy set-up with sprint...",4
I purchased this phone from the seller and when I received it I was unable to use it. I invested alot of time and money trying to fix it and couldn't. The seller would not communicate with me about the phone when I was trying to fix it so it was returned to seller. My experience with this product was very stressful to say the least.,1
"The item is exactly as it was described and shipping was as expected, by far the best thing I have bought on Amazon. The price was a lot but it's bc it's practically brand new, but it was totally worth all the money I spent on ift, I love it!!",5
I just got my new iphone 5s Today it came in the iPhone 5s gold box and looked brand new! Everything is in tact no scratches or any screen problems at all! Shipping also came very early. My predicted shipping was 5-110 days after my purchase and it came two days from after i put my order in!,5
Had the phone for 6 months and had no problem. So much faster than any android I ever had the music thing is annoying but you get used to downloading songs of iTunes lol.,5
The phone they sent me was manufactured for sale in Japan (or another similar country) and thus I cannot shut off the camera shutter sound. It's very annoying.,2
"Phone came in the mail dead with a scratch on the screen. Once I charged it up and tried it out, multiple letters on the keyboard did not work. To top it off, after one day of owning this ""good conditioned"" iPhone, the screen went completely bizarre. Terrible seller.",1
excellent condition and working perfect. Don't do an upgrade from your carrier to get a phone because it went bad. I'm happy with this and I'm not in another 2 yr contract with AT&T,5
This phone came in great shape. No visible scratches at all. We had no problems at all getting Sprint service added. And so far no problems and works great. So glad we bought this phone at such a great price.,5
I was hoping this wouldn't be a crApple product but after less than 2 months of use the phone shuts off randomly & as of lately refusing to boot up for hours.This is absolutely disgusting.,1
I ordered another IPhone before this one & was given one with scratches & the lock screen did not work. This one came as explained in the bio! Works great came in mint condition I love my IPhone!,5
"I needed to recieve this by Christmas as a gift for my boyfriend and did! The seller has great communication via email, and inturn was able to provide ideal customer service. The product is working great and my boyfriend had the best christmas ever. Thank you!",5
"I bought this iphone the other day and I am absolutely in love. Everything came as described. I had the iphone 4s prior to this phone and was inneed of a upgrade, Im very satisfied with the iphone 5s, battery lasts much longer and the camera is way better on this phone. I recommend people to order this phone from here, it really is worth it!",5
Product is great and meet my expatations of a telephone what is needed to experience the modern world. Maybe wen ordered from Europe the adapter can be fit to match the european electricity outlets.Regards Peter,5
"I had the iPhone 4S before and was waiting to upgrade to a newer version but didn't really see the need with the iPhone 5, I'm so glad I waited because I'm in love with my new phone. It came just as it was described and the seller communicated with me in reguards to any questions I had, I would deffenately buy from this seller again in the future.",5
"I love it. I never had an iPhone before and I am so glad I bought this one. It is just like new and I have seen others like this on ""sale"" for over $500.00 so I got a great deal.",5
"this item arrived perfectly fine, on time and it looked great on the outside but the part where it charges the phone was old, moldy and burnt, and there is no way to fix it. I wasted $250.",1
"Phone works fine, but went through the run around to get a SIM card. NO...the phone doesn't come with one. Luckily, I was able to get one from Apple because Sprint doesn't have them to give to customers.",3
"Phone was still owned by previous owner and his/her name wasn't clear from at&t, therefore have trouble activating the phone.Update: Resolve when speak with at&t representative, showing them the receipt that I purchase this phone.",1
"Phone does not say percentage by the battery, caused me problems when I was restoring it. Charger is FAKE. Not pleased because of that. The phone is also causing me problems with music. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate the phone a 6.",3
"I have had some erratic incidents that I had not had with my previous 5s. Eventually they went away, but it has caused me to question the product or the source a bit.",3
"i could not insert a nano sim chip then i do not know if works. I noticed that if you buy the 64 GB from the apple store for Tmobile is cheaper than this one, also is unlocked. I didn't know about that.",3
IT was not totally fine. It has a rattle like the insides don't quite fit tightly. I am having some issues with it not responding to internet quickly. But this does not happen all the time.,3
"I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED!",1
Ordered this as a gift for my daughter's 17th birthday and so far she's in love with it. Everything was as described and it even arrived earlier than expected!,5
The phone they sent me was manufactured for sale in Japan (or another similar country) and thus I cannot shut off the camera shutter sound. It's very annoying.,2
This phone is absolutely amazing & this is the first iPhone I've ever had :). The battery is better than Android because I only need to charge it every 2 days instead of everyday. It's very well designed & I'll stick with Apple for a very long time haha.,3
I'am very satisfied with purchasing my new phone. Everything described was exactly true about the conditions of the phone which looks practically new. I would reccomend anyone to get their phone with them :),5
So far this phone has been exactly what I wanted it for! It was nice to get an Iphone for a lower price and not have to shell out the big bucks!A few times the phone has had some glitches but it worked after restarting it. But overall what I wanted!!,4
Phone works and was in really good condition the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I ordered a silver iphone and recieved the space grey iphone.,4
Overall it's a good productBut I did see some minor blemishes such as scratches also the screen was popped out in one corner but the technology was fine,3
before ordering the iphone 5s i was like man whats the point of touch id it sounds like a stupid gimmick. in reality its a great tool for phone security because people don't see you put in your password. I also like that it's faster to log into my phone.,5
"It got here fast, order got here in 2 days standard shipping. I love it, looks new came in IPhone box with ear buds, and charger. Could not have ask for anything better. Will recommend to everybody. Thanks for the phone!",5
"Didn't realize how small the screen was...much smaller than my LG which got damaged. I don't like the sound on this. I am unable to put my vm's on speaker so can barely hear my messages, even with the volume at max. The one thing I do like is it since with all my other Apple devices.",3
I should've upgraded ages ago but was too cheap. So glad I can finally get rid of my 4s and be up to speed with the rest of the world! The 5s is so much faster and more responsive. The cable that came with my phone stopped working after just a couple weeks but I replaced it with an Amazon cable and we are good to go.,5
Shh .. This is a Christmas Gift from Santa Clause! This phone arrived before the due date & get this .. It came with EXTRAS that wasn't even mentioned or known! I was exstatic when I opened the package & saw everything so I definitely know my recipient of this gift will be too!!!,5
"This phone has been exactly what I expected and wanted. Moreover, the seller was fantastic, did a great job of transferring the phone, packing and shipping securely and promptly.",5
"My wife's iPhone 4 died and she wanted a new one, but didn't want to commit to another 2-year contract. I bought this new from Amazon for $250 less than what Sprint would charge me.",5
I purchased this phone from the seller and when I received it I was unable to use it. I invested alot of time and money trying to fix it and couldn't. The seller would not communicate with me about the phone when I was trying to fix it so it was returned to seller. My experience with this product was very stressful to say the least.,1
"The item is exactly as it was described and shipping was as expected, by far the best thing I have bought on Amazon. The price was a lot but it's bc it's practically brand new, but it was totally worth all the money I spent on ift, I love it!!",5
"Shipped perfectly. Using flawlessly for months on end. Would suggest buying a SIM card with it unless you live close to a Spring store, I had to make three trips to get it working properly. However, that isn't the buyer's fault, Sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10",5
I was very excited to receive the phone in a short amount of time and to see it was basically brand new and had some charge in it so I could activate it right away! I was also very happy that it came with not 1 but 2 chargers!,5
"Amazing phone. I woke up the next morning after using the phone, I named her Siri; and she made me coffee. I come home from work and all my clothes are folded and put away nicely. What an amazing phone the 5S is. The only problem is we can't take a shower together, something about the water Siri doesn't like. I love my 5S. <3",5
Very disapionted as I'm in Australia and the fone can't be used I understood fone locked for sprint but would axept overseas sim for use out side the states stuck with a fone that the carriers won't unlock,1
I purchased the phone used for $350 and have been using it for the past month. I recommend the phone at this price point.Pros:Good cameraTouch ID is accurate and convenientGood 4 inch sizeFast processorPurchased 1 year used and it still works wellIt runs iOS 8.1Cons:Home button works but has a small clicking sound.No Apple pay/ NFC,5
It was unblocked and never been unblocked. Charger was so dirty and disgusting! I could not finalize talk to seller who promised to unlock the phone but never did,1
"This was a upgrade from the 5c. The only issue i had was that this phone did not come with a SIM card, but the nice guy i called at ATT told me what to do, and this phone works like a charm! i am SO happy!The phone was in excellent shape, one minor blemish that is easily ignored (or covered with a sparkly phone case).",5
This is a great phone. iPhone 5S is a great phone. Can do many things. Like multi-tasking is great. The #5 version is a stronger and very popular to work. The pictures are the most easiest for a touch phone. And much faster then the iPhone 4. Try it I think you would like it. I recently bought this for a friend of mine. And she thinks its great.,5
I purchased this phone and had contact with seller to make sure it's a att phone. They said yes. Well went to att and it's not an att phone. They checked it and it will not accept simple card from att.,1
Phone looks great does as expected. Sadly the battery is useless. After fully charging it still dies within two hours. Now that should have been stated in the sale listing too. Now off to buy a battery!!! I don't like dishonesty or failure to disclose. especially when it comes to this sort of item.,2
I wish I could give this 0 stars.The phone is dirty and cracked up. It looks like its been through hell and back.This phone has water damage and the screen is blur.I demand a refund this is going back.,1
I ordered the phone on the Monday night (the night I broke my phone and couldn't use it) and it arrived on Friday. The phone looks great and works well. Thank you for your swift service and delivery.,5
"Got this for my daughter for her birthday, was listed as good condition but it was practically brand new just didn't have a box. Super fast shipping! Thank you",5
Overall a nice little phone though the antennae seems a little week to me. I was up in the mountains near my home and my sons cheap go phone had better reception. Both phones are AT&T...,4
"Came as claimed. Near flawless condition... I couldn't find anything wrong with it if I tried. Only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum... No apple logo or and writing, at all. But it grew on me its very sleek. Phone operates as expected and is lightning fast. I would suggest to anyone.",5
Great phone! I've had the 4 and the 4s and the 5s is amazing! So slim and fast and there is definitely a BIG difference in the phone compared to the 4/4s. Absolutely love apple and iOS 7. And I'm in love with the gold color!,5
"I have sold my Apple iPhone 5s 16GB, as I needed an UNBLOCKED unit, and although I thought I was bying an unblocked version, it turned out that I wasn't. I have since acquired the same machine, here in South Africa, and it is the best thing that I have ever acquired!!!!",1
This phone works great at first I thought it was defective because it would not turn on but I found out that the lock switch was on which would not let the phone charge or turn on after I turned that off the phone works like brand new great deal for the price,5
The phone came in alright condition. It has scratches and dings on. BUT it does not come with a SIM and it is not clearly noted on the description. Make sure you have a SIM because it's a huge pain to get one! Two to three weeks shipping for me.,3
"One of three phones I bought this month from Amazon third-party because of ""drowned"" phones. This was one was as described (or better). Shipping was very fast! Very satisfied so far!",5
"After some issues, not by the seller, the Item was as described. It's perfect! And they gave me a car charger and two phones cases for the mishap. Thank you!",5
"I bought it as new but when i get it today and opened it it was used and broken, i did not activated it yet going to do it tomorrow hope it will work i am very upset.",1
"I'm writing this review after using the phone over a year. It was easy to hook up w sprint right out of the box, and has been working well for me since Dec 2015. I can upgrade to a new phone now but haven't because there is no need -this refurbished phone still functions without noticeable hiccups.",5
Item was ok.WARNING: IT does not come with a SIM card. Must have a SIM card from the carrier to be able to activate/ use it. Had to order a nano SIM card to make it work (still waiting on those to be delivered),2
This phone has worked great for me for two years now. I also hate cases and have dropped it a thousand times preparing myself for the worst when I pick it up and it's still in great condition.,5
Was doing really good. Now this week my screens are freezing up i have to push home button and turn back on to get messages or my square. sometimes freezes up while i am using it. is a pain to use square to collect money for my sales and turn off and on couple of times to complete a transaction.,3
The product came in less than a week. It was in perfect condition and was as described. I was able to activate the phone immediately with no issues what so ever.,5
I have not even had this phone for a month and now the home button does not work!! Have not dropped it I don't know why it just stopped working from one day to the next very disappointed!! Also the screen on the side looks like it is about to pop out any minute!!,1
"Recently purchased this iPhone about 1 month or 2 months ago, sometimes it decides not to charge and then screen frezzes. its a ""NEW"" iPhone but its giving me problems..",3
It was a nice and brand new phone but it wasn't factory unlocked so I had a hard time getting it to work. I had to call 3 different companies and none could provide me with an unlock code so I had to make the decision to send this phone back and settle for a different phone that is unlocked.,2
Ordered this phone thinking it was a sprint phone.. I went to activate it on the sprint network and it isn't actually a sprint phone.. Very frustrated.,1
"I love it. I never had an iPhone before and I am so glad I bought this one. It is just like new and I have seen others like this on ""sale"" for over $500.00 so I got a great deal.",5
It was great. Has worked well. but I would like to kindly request for the name that was attached to the sprint account. It is equested for the unlocking of the device. Please contact on my email ubong21@gmail.com,4
I purchased a iPhone5s and the description said it was unlocked. At&t says it is not unlocked and will not release the phone to consumer cellular. I will be returning the phone today and looking to purchase somewhere else.,1
I was a little skeptical at first but once I received the phone and activated I was incredibly happy with what I bought I recommend this seller to anybody looking to buy an iPhone on amazon. 5 start quality for sure,5
"When I got my iPhone it was in new condition, but the iPhone was defective, the phone would do a blue screen loop, and then put itself into recovery mode every single night, when I went to go recover it, halfway it would fail. Thankfully the iPhone had the 1 year warranty still I'm effect, so I brought it to the apple store and got a new iPhone.",5
Phone sold as new was not had been activated 6 months early and we could not activate through apple or iTunes. Theregote I feel time snd money wasted.,1
Bought the new iphone to try it so far so good. It really isnt TOO GREAT i have been using other phones like the Xperia Z2 although Iphone 5S has some cool new features like the fingerprint scanner it isnt really something that changes the game.... It is the kind of features that u use the first time u buy the phone and then forget about,3
"Amazing phone. I woke up the next morning after using the phone, I named her Siri; and she made me coffee. I come home from work and all my clothes are folded and put away nicely. What an amazing phone the 5S is. The only problem is we can't take a shower together, something about the water Siri doesn't like. I love my 5S. <3",5
Very disapionted as I'm in Australia and the fone can't be used I understood fone locked for sprint but would axept overseas sim for use out side the states stuck with a fone that the carriers won't unlock,1
Awesome Used Product.. No Flaw except some hazy look on screen when its screen is off.. Outer body dont have a single scratch and phone is running without any issue,4
"the phone speakers broke after a month and a half. do not buy from them. they are a 3rd party who ""fixes"" phones with tape to hold parts together. buying from them was the biggest mistake of my life. i thought they were posing as apple and sold me a crapy phone. THEY ARE FAKE!!!! DO NOT TRUST THEM!!!!",1
I really really LOOVVEEE this iPhone ! 😍😍 thank you soooooooooooooooo much ! I couldn't ask for Better . and for a cheap price ? this is excellent . it looks brand new but you have to buy your own charger and box AND headphones but the phone is still worth it ! make sure you charge the phone before you deliver it though . :/,5
"I love my phone and it is in great condition but it is an Iphone 5 not a 5S and I payed for a 5S not a 5. The shipping and the quality of the phone was great, but I wanted a 5S.",2
"Phone I got was in decent visual condition. However, battery does not last with more than 1 hour of use. Also, after 3 days the speaker stopped working. Buyer beware, these are junk refurbished phones.",1
"This phone was horrible. Within a few months, it was completely useless. It glitches out all the time, I couldn't even write a text message. Huge waste of money.",1
This phone is the right size and as is fast!! It was purchased for my son's birthday. He is happy with this phone. My son prefers the smaller phones and this works for him as some larger ones like the iPhone 6 and 7 are too big for his taste.,5
"Works great! Does not uncles SIM card but you can purchase one online or through a phone call. Perfect screen. Very minimal marks on the back, but if you use a case it looks brand new.",5
"This Iphone product didn't meet my expectations at all. There were many damages around the phone casing, and the main speaker, on the front screen, wasn't working properly. Also the phone over-heats; not to mention the battery life drains faster than usual.",1
I really like the iphone 5S. It is my first and only smart phone so I can't judge it according to other makes. The learning curve is terrible an Apple does't tell you much about using it even starting. They assume you know the basics of smart phones apparently. Amazon Warehouse were excellent to do business with.,5
The description said never been out of the box when I got it there was NO box NO booklet NO charger. besides that I love the phone no scratches no nothing.,3
"Arrived on time, quick shipment! The phone arrived in its original box & factory sealed by Apple. Received my order in less than 24 hours. Plus I got it for a great price! Highly recommended!",5
I am sorry I never wrote a review for you when you I purchased this. Phone was exactly as described and works great. We some issues getting it set up because it was still on the buyers apple account. The buyer worked fast on getting it removed and we were able to add to our provider within two days. Thank You!,5
"The product is marked as like new, but the mobilephone i received screen scratches.And the top of the screen will be dented with a little strength,use my hand.",3
My new iphone 5s arrived ahead of schedule. My iphone 5s arrived in very good condition without any incidents. The price was just right.Now I can purchase my iwatch. Thanks James Thom,5
"I did not realize that the phone was not unlocked and made ​​the mistake to buy it for the Sprint company. I live in Argentina , and wanted to know if you know any way to unlock it or I can send some code to do it?",4
"Bought this phone to replace 4S, but have had nothing but trouble. The camera only works toward the texter, not out the back the right way. My I tunes and computer do not recognize it at all. How do I get a refund?",1
"I was hesitant about purchasing this phone but I'm glad I did! The phone got here 1 day earlier than I expected, it looks almost new, everything works great, and it came with the charging cables! Very happy with my purchase!",5
"It got here fast, order got here in 2 days standard shipping. I love it, looks new came in IPhone box with ear buds, and charger. Could not have ask for anything better. Will recommend to everybody. Thanks for the phone!",5
"The phone I got was highly used, many dinks on the side. the front touch screen was replaced with after market junk. The touch screen stopped working after two weeks. The wifi and LTE data also slowed to a crawl. I don't recommend a used iPhone.",1
"Phone came in the mail dead with a scratch on the screen. Once I charged it up and tried it out, multiple letters on the keyboard did not work. To top it off, after one day of owning this ""good conditioned"" iPhone, the screen went completely bizarre. Terrible seller.",1
excellent condition and working perfect. Don't do an upgrade from your carrier to get a phone because it went bad. I'm happy with this and I'm not in another 2 yr contract with AT&T,5
This phone came in great shape. No visible scratches at all. We had no problems at all getting Sprint service added. And so far no problems and works great. So glad we bought this phone at such a great price.,5
"Was advertised as a refurbished phone. But it was used not refurbished. Refurbished almost always have a new shell. But are to definitely be fully tested. More rigorous testing than new products. However, this phone was scratched up. And microphone is not working at 100%. As others he me as muffled.",2
"This was an amazing upgrade for us since we were still using a 3Gs. I would prefer a more solid battery, and I wish that voice control/siri could function w/o internet access but other than that; it's a good product at this price point.",4
I was skeptical about ordering a used iPhone but I am thrilled with the phone I received. It is in perfect condition and exactly as advertised. Not a flaw on it that I can see. The SIM card from my old phone was too big. I took it to an ATT store and they cut it to fit. No charge. My phone was working the same day I received it.,5
"this is a great phone! It arrived in perfect, new condition. No SIM card, but Apple took care of that quickly and with no charge. It arrived quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas",5
"Paid almost $20 extra for overnight shipping, phone came 4 days later, plugged in the charger n it started smoking. Phone it's self was as advertised and works fine just wish it was a better overall experience.",3
"Came as advertised, put in the SIM Card, registered phone with provider, syncd with ITunes and was up in no time at all. Was a new locked phone for Sprint and couldn't have worked any better. Quick delivery, excellent product and I couldn't be happier.",5
"this is a great phone! It arrived in perfect, new condition. No SIM card, but Apple took care of that quickly and with no charge. It arrived quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas",5
"Not sure about a used phone in this price range, but very happy with the cost and it is much better condition than expected. Already past the 30-days and no problems. Works great. I will buy more phones like this.",5
"Mine works perfectly! I have yet to find any scratches on the screen, so it's in great condition! Plus, I have over 2500 songs and tons of apps on my phone now and I still have about 38 GB of free space! I am EXTREMELY pleased!",5
"The phone was shipped quickly, however I received the iPhone 5 instead of the 5s model that the title and description state it is. Needed a new phone as soon as possible so I didn't return the item. It works great and looked brand new. I'm just disappointed I didn't get what I thought I was paying for.",3
"Phone is a bit more quirky than I'd hoped, touchscreen seems to lose letters and motions here and there, but I think that's just iOS8 being weird, hopefully it'll get better with the next update.",4
"This item came very fast. I was disappointed when they told me it will arrive in a week, but so happy and overwhelmed when it arrived in two days without PRIME connection. The iPhone works perfectly and don't regret purchasing. Best thing I've bought!",5
"The score I am hit to customer service, a staff name Racquel,I buy this phone in a month ago, because of some reasons lead to the phone I haven't use!Finally I reflect the problem to think name is Racquel staff, he is very careful, and have the patience to help me to solve this problem!",5
I was hoping this wouldn't be a crApple product but after less than 2 months of use the phone shuts off randomly & as of lately refusing to boot up for hours.This is absolutely disgusting.,1
I ordered another IPhone before this one & was given one with scratches & the lock screen did not work. This one came as explained in the bio! Works great came in mint condition I love my IPhone!,5
"I needed to recieve this by Christmas as a gift for my boyfriend and did! The seller has great communication via email, and inturn was able to provide ideal customer service. The product is working great and my boyfriend had the best christmas ever. Thank you!",5
"I bought this iphone the other day and I am absolutely in love. Everything came as described. I had the iphone 4s prior to this phone and was inneed of a upgrade, Im very satisfied with the iphone 5s, battery lasts much longer and the camera is way better on this phone. I recommend people to order this phone from here, it really is worth it!",5
Product is great and meet my expatations of a telephone what is needed to experience the modern world. Maybe wen ordered from Europe the adapter can be fit to match the european electricity outlets.Regards Peter,5
"I had the iPhone 4S before and was waiting to upgrade to a newer version but didn't really see the need with the iPhone 5, I'm so glad I waited because I'm in love with my new phone. It came just as it was described and the seller communicated with me in reguards to any questions I had, I would deffenately buy from this seller again in the future.",5
"The phone does not hold a charge for over 3 hours, the auto rotate function does not work, the compass does not funtion. To sum it up, if I were to have a second chance I would NOT buy a used phone here.",1
This phone was in great condition I have had it for about a month now and I haven't had any problems it was a great purchase great price all around great,5
It arrived sealed in the box phone works and looks great the Apple iPhone 5s is extremely easy to use I actually purchased it for my twelve year old daughter and she has not put it down it was a great gift for her,5
"It's really good! But sometimes, it doesn't find good signal! I don't know why... If it's the cellphone, or if it's the carrier! The product is amazing, what I had found",4
We are very satisfied with our purchase. The dealer answered questions promptly and communicated with professionalism. would definitely recommend people purchase from this site and this dealer. will be purchasing again soon. Product exceeded my expectations. very satisfied.,5
currently very very pleased with this phone!! i bought it refurbished and it is like brand new. i have had no problems so far and hope i don't have to encounter any.,5
"Good phone performs like it should.but calls have static sometimes but it goes away but phone was in awesome condition , very happy I would recommend. Fast shipping too I needed the phone.",5
phone did not work properly. we had to take it to ATT store. the #1 button would not work on keyboard. they had to replace the glass $110. now it works fine. pretty disappointing. It was shipped to my daughter in college and there was no time to send it back and get another one.,1
"When this phone arrived, it either wasn't unlocked or wasn't an ATT compatible phone which is what we supposedly bought. It won't activate on our line which makes it basically pointless.",1
The sound did not work properly which makes it hard if you can't hear text messages or people when you answer the phone. First and foremost it must work as a phone. Customer service was great at facilitating returns but it would have been nice to double check everything before shipping things out.,1
My son does not get the best of signal when at home or in small town areas. But overall he seems to enjoy this phone and has no other complaint. Package came as promised and delivered late due to a mix up but was refunded the shipment before phone arrived. Overall very satisfied,4
"Appearance of the phone was perfect, unfortunately after 93 days of ownership the video blew out. There was no physical damage to the phone, it just stopped functioning and does not appear repairable.",1
"No complaints, people should read and understand what they going to buy before they start complaining, got my phone in very good condition, for the price and very honest services..",5
Overall it's a good productBut I did see some minor blemishes such as scratches also the screen was popped out in one corner but the technology was fine,3
"A friend asked me to order this item, the phone came with no charger, screen corners are darker than usual, ICCID says unknown and I paid $189 for this. I want my money back ASAP, pleassse somebody.",1
Terrible! It is a Sprint phone and they couldn't turn it on. I tried to return it but never heard back from the seller. Then I tried to unlock it and have T-Mobile turn it on. They couldn't do it either. This was a waste of my money!!!!,1
Works and arrived as advertised. I feel the the motherboard was scrapped from a 4s because it shows up on AT&T and iTunes as a 4s. I crossed-checked the serial number through Apple and it says it is a 5s so the controlling component must have been from a 4s. Other than that I'm happy with the purchase.,4
The home button made a clicking sound every time i pressed it and it took a fall and the back camera went out i pulled it apart fixed but forgot to put something on it and then it wouldnt turn on the motherboard went but that was my fault really,3
"Arrived early and came as described (minor imperfections on back surface). My sister lost her previous sprint iPhone & this is for her birthday! Hopefully, easy set-up with sprint...",4
Its permanently locked to Sprint and I am travelling to a different country. Now I am not able to use it as its locked.This information was missing during the time of purchase.,1
This is the second time I've bought an iPhone online. I wish I'd known about this company the first time around. The phone is exactly as it was described! It works and looks perfect! Would absolutely buy from them again! Thank you so much!,5
The phone is beautiful. However i only had a couple of problems with it. The top left corner is glitchy and there is a red dot on the lcd display when turned on. Other than that the phone is perfect. I would buy from this seller again.,3
"Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service.",1
Ordered three of these phones and non of them would connect to Sprint's network. Sprint told me that they were incompatible with their system. They were also not new phones and were refurbished.,1
"My apologies - I didn't know that my phone is synced with my hearing aids - and, therefore, ""blue tooth"" is on all the time. So, that is causing the battery to run down faster than I'm used to. The phone is just fine and the vendor was most cooperative.",4
"I bought this Iphone because I wanted to use it in Mexico but it doesn't work, on the website description said that It just works in US just with sprint but in others countries it would work totally fine like Mexico, so I would like to return it.",1
"I didn't read all description, so I thought that the product was available for all phone carriers. When I wanted to activate with other carrier and I couldn't do that, I reread the complete description and understood which was my problem.",4
"I was scared to buy a phone online because I didn't want it to be broken, but I'm so happy this phone is perfect. Works great no scratches. Very friendly, buy their stuff!",5
"i could not insert a nano sim chip then i do not know if works. I noticed that if you buy the 64 GB from the apple store for Tmobile is cheaper than this one, also is unlocked. I didn't know about that.",3
Ok I bought this iPhone now I can't activate it I am desipointed . I need this unlock now they say that there is no unlock code for this phone .pls if u are buying an iPhone make sure it is unlock this was s wast of my time and money. I am KENDAL HANNA a dissatisfied customer,1
"Brand new in sealed box, as promised. Minor complaint -- this must be from a foreign market, because the charger and brick in the box is not a US plug. Seller included a US plug in the amazon box, but its a generic charging cable and brick, not apple. Otherwise, very happy with the product.",5
"Very undone. Speaker was blown, front facing had to replaced as well as the battery after I found out it was an aftermarketed replacement that was too thick for the facing to seat correctly. Overall spent over $200 to have it in basic standings",1
There wasn't a SIMS card with it. Which my have been my fault for not double checking out reading through everything. I'm not sure they advertised no SIM card though. But it was in great shape and exactly what I was looking for. No scratches or problems either. Also the charger they sent me didn't work.,3
"the phone works great, but i did have to get the power cord replaced shortly after receiving it. but the apple store gave it to me for free because it was still under warrenty",4
"this item arrived perfectly fine, on time and it looked great on the outside but the part where it charges the phone was old, moldy and burnt, and there is no way to fix it. I wasted $250.",1
"It looked good, but the battery is shot and it won't charge very fast. Now we are stuck. That was all her Christmas money. Don't buy used! Or refurbished...it took an hour and a half in the Sprint store to get all the updates loaded.",2
I love the form factor. Just the right size for my needs. The 6 was too large for someone who usually keeps the phone in his pocket. The extra memory means I'll never run out of room for apps and pics. Plenty fast even with the new OS.,5
"Phone was in excellent condition. The price and the quality of the device are unparalleled to any other phone product on Amazon. I would not only reuse this service if needed, but would recommend to anyone that asked.",5
"Came with one charging cable, and the phone. No box or anything, but I don't need any more apple boxes on my shelves. I saved a lot of money, and would buy from these fellas and gals again..",5
I purchased this phone from the seller and when I received it I was unable to use it. I invested alot of time and money trying to fix it and couldn't. The seller would not communicate with me about the phone when I was trying to fix it so it was returned to seller. My experience with this product was very stressful to say the least.,1
"The item is exactly as it was described and shipping was as expected, by far the best thing I have bought on Amazon. The price was a lot but it's bc it's practically brand new, but it was totally worth all the money I spent on ift, I love it!!",5
I just got my new iphone 5s Today it came in the iPhone 5s gold box and looked brand new! Everything is in tact no scratches or any screen problems at all! Shipping also came very early. My predicted shipping was 5-110 days after my purchase and it came two days from after i put my order in!,5
Had the phone for 6 months and had no problem. So much faster than any android I ever had the music thing is annoying but you get used to downloading songs of iTunes lol.,5
Shh .. This is a Christmas Gift from Santa Clause! This phone arrived before the due date & get this .. It came with EXTRAS that wasn't even mentioned or known! I was exstatic when I opened the package & saw everything so I definitely know my recipient of this gift will be too!!!,5
"This phone has been exactly what I expected and wanted. Moreover, the seller was fantastic, did a great job of transferring the phone, packing and shipping securely and promptly.",5
"My wife's iPhone 4 died and she wanted a new one, but didn't want to commit to another 2-year contract. I bought this new from Amazon for $250 less than what Sprint would charge me.",5
This phone is absolutely amazing & this is the first iPhone I've ever had :). The battery is better than Android because I only need to charge it every 2 days instead of everyday. It's very well designed & I'll stick with Apple for a very long time haha.,3
I'am very satisfied with purchasing my new phone. Everything described was exactly true about the conditions of the phone which looks practically new. I would reccomend anyone to get their phone with them :),5
So far this phone has been exactly what I wanted it for! It was nice to get an Iphone for a lower price and not have to shell out the big bucks!A few times the phone has had some glitches but it worked after restarting it. But overall what I wanted!!,4
Phone works and was in really good condition the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I ordered a silver iphone and recieved the space grey iphone.,4
"Sprint refused to activate this phone on a pre-paid plan. We ended up returning it. The phone itself appeared unused and in the original box. However, it did not have the Apple factory seal on the box so was apparently not ""new"".",2
Worst thing ever..... Ordered the home thinking I was gonna be able to use it.... And turns out it was for the wrong carrier as described in the ad. I was very upset... This is the first time something like this has ever happened.,1
before ordering the iphone 5s i was like man whats the point of touch id it sounds like a stupid gimmick. in reality its a great tool for phone security because people don't see you put in your password. I also like that it's faster to log into my phone.,5
"I've had this phone for about two months now and I absolutely love it! It's a great phone. One problem though, the brightness sometimes changes by itself even with auto-brightness turned off. Other than that, it's a great phone.",5
bought this used from amazon. was worried about it not working or missing a cable but it came with new everything except an apple box. sure beats buying a new one for close to $1000. works great and its new to me.,5
"Didn't realize how small the screen was...much smaller than my LG which got damaged. I don't like the sound on this. I am unable to put my vm's on speaker so can barely hear my messages, even with the volume at max. The one thing I do like is it since with all my other Apple devices.",3
I should've upgraded ages ago but was too cheap. So glad I can finally get rid of my 4s and be up to speed with the rest of the world! The 5s is so much faster and more responsive. The cable that came with my phone stopped working after just a couple weeks but I replaced it with an Amazon cable and we are good to go.,5
I absolutely love this phone. Being an 17 year old I had worried about buying an iPhone on Amazon for such a low price of 199$ but this phone is absolutely amazing and I totally recommend you buying this phone! It came earlier than expected and came with a charger.,5
The phone has been to the AT&T store twice and help from Apple Support . It may have serious problems. Not sure iif I should send it back or give it more time.,2
"Good price. Phone is immaculate. Fast delivery. No issues. Love the phone, much better than the 5c I had. Touch ID is a nice feature. Wonderful camera.",5
"Great, connection is lost at times but maybe the connection is due to ATT. Didn't come with charger like supposed to. But works great. Came charged. Almost new.",4
"Very good used iphone 5s. Product came exactly as described in product details. Good batter life, cosmetic condition. And shipping was fast after an initial wait period.",5
IT was not totally fine. It has a rattle like the insides don't quite fit tightly. I am having some issues with it not responding to internet quickly. But this does not happen all the time.,3
"I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED!",1
Ordered this as a gift for my daughter's 17th birthday and so far she's in love with it. Everything was as described and it even arrived earlier than expected!,5
"Shipped perfectly. Using flawlessly for months on end. Would suggest buying a SIM card with it unless you live close to a Spring store, I had to make three trips to get it working properly. However, that isn't the buyer's fault, Sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10",5
I was very excited to receive the phone in a short amount of time and to see it was basically brand new and had some charge in it so I could activate it right away! I was also very happy that it came with not 1 but 2 chargers!,5
this phone has disabled me more times than i can say in the short time i have had it. if i could return this phone i would..very unhappy w this phone...,2
"Phone works fine, but went through the run around to get a SIM card. NO...the phone doesn't come with one. Luckily, I was able to get one from Apple because Sprint doesn't have them to give to customers.",3
"Phone was still owned by previous owner and his/her name wasn't clear from at&t, therefore have trouble activating the phone.Update: Resolve when speak with at&t representative, showing them the receipt that I purchase this phone.",1
"this phone was in great shape when I got it and was exactly as they said! I was worried about it being broken or defective, but the phone is working great and I have absolutely no problems :)",5
"The phone did not come unlocked as advertised. When the package was delivered, it was stated in the bill that was locked onto the AT&T Network, not Factory Unlocked as advertised.",3
"Phone does not say percentage by the battery, caused me problems when I was restoring it. Charger is FAKE. Not pleased because of that. The phone is also causing me problems with music. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate the phone a 6.",3
"I have had some erratic incidents that I had not had with my previous 5s. Eventually they went away, but it has caused me to question the product or the source a bit.",3
"As far as the iPhone goes I like it. As far as this particular one, the screen is sometimes unresponsive requiring a restart. Not cool.update. downgrading to one star. it quit on me last night. it is still on, but the screen wont come on. am having to return it and I cant even wipe it before i do. not cool.",1
The phone they sent me was manufactured for sale in Japan (or another similar country) and thus I cannot shut off the camera shutter sound. It's very annoying.,2
"Im loving it....So far it works very good no problems, no damages, scratches or anything. Came on time arrived by the 20th which was a couple days ago. It's all what was described about the iPhone 5s and to say im glad i bought it.",5
This seller is amazing! I asked about a million questions and they were More than happy to respond to them. When I got the phone I cut my SIM card down to size and it responded immediately! Phone is basically perfect!!,5
"Perfect perfect perfect! My phone came right on time. I got it and it was like new just as he said. He also sent a charger and a cute pink otter box which was great, because I didn't have to go out and buy one. Thanks!!",5
"i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs though. They are involved with Dr Dre now and I heard they are going to make bigger phones, something Steve Jobs was against. Guess we will see.",5
This person selling this item is a liar .. I asked specifically if this unit is for t mobile. The sell told me yes.. I put a tmobile SIM card in this phone that was sent to me but it did not read because the Carrier was sent to sprint,1
Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,1
Phone arrived quickly as described and worked great for a week. After a day bouncing between Apple and my carrier Apple replaced the phone for a new one. The new phone lasted a week and I had to make another appointment with Apple and they replaced that phone. Quality control could be better. Has all the bells and whistle to keep my daughter happy.,4
"Good phone and in good condition, but recently discovered that this is only an Iphone 5, not a 5s. Also, it didn't come with the stock earbuds, which are expensive. FALSE ADVERTISING.",2
This was advertised as new. Took it to Apple as the battery was depleted after 2 months. They refused to work on it because the battery was third party as were many of the buttons and inner working!! This was not as advertised at all.,1
"This person is a scam artist. I bought my phone, everything works great for a while, then it is reported that the payments are not being made on it and the IMIE is blocked. This person knows exactly what they are doing and they are criminals.",1
I enjoy the fingerprint addition so when people are nearby I can just touch the home button to unlock my phone without anyone lurking to see me enter my unlock code.,5
Great phone works well with T-Mobile. Game new out-of-the-box in perfect mint condition. It's the right size phone for me I had a Samsung galaxy S3 before that wouldn't fit in my pocket. This phone is lightning fastsyncs with my iTunes automatically can't say enough good things about it. Seller shipped fast no issues,5
I love this phone! I cut my original Sim card that was in my Samsung Galaxy and put it in the new Iphone 5s and it works great.Internet responds super fast and the fingerprint unlock is amazing. Condition is perfect and it came in the original box. I'm very happy with my purchase.,5
"This phone sucks!!😒 Do not waste your money on this product. The first day I got it, it was powering off by itself many times. It always froze. I bought it 4 months ago and now it does not work at all!!! The screen popped out all the time. Even tho it says new it is definitely used! Worst phone I probably ever had !",1
"This phone is okay. My son purchased it, he didn't realize how little storage there is. He is constantly deleting nearly all apps and photos to make the phone operable.",3
"Phone was in perfect condition when I got it, everything was fine, until I put the SIM in. Phone was blocked on my network and was reported as stolen. Needless to say, I am NOT happy with this outcome.",1
Great item! Received it a day earlier than expected but works great! Good condition except for stickers on back! Other than that great deal! I reccomend!,5
I bought this for a friend.1. The product arrived very quickly. It didn't take the amount of time that amazon said it would so that's always a plus.2. Minimal damage to the phone. It worked like a charm3. It's STILL working. lol. My friend is horrible with phones and yet he's managed to keep this one in tact.,5
"the back camera stopped working, the phone touch screen stops working and i have to restart the phone to get it to work. The phone is a huge disappointment. Not worth what i paid for it.",1
"Phone was fine at first, but after two weeks it was constantly shutting down. The power button got stuck down. Took the phone to Apple and they said it was toast. I was able to return this phone through Amazon though for a full refund and ended up just buying a new I-Phone 6 from my wireless provider.",1
it crazy if you lunch an app it takes you outcant hear people without headphones and for them you sound farand cant take phonescalls sometimes it impossible would not recomended,1
This was supposed to be new! It's two years old! I was mislead into believing I was buying a new iPhone. Now it's messing up and I went to Apple Store and they told me its two years old and warranty is up! I got ripped of!!!!!!!!!!,1
A very good device. My only problem is its size. It is heavy in a shirt pocket and inconvenient in hip pocket of a trouser. It slips out very easily from a pocket. I have lost it already 3 times in the last six months but fortunately each time I could find it.,4
Just got my iPhone in the mail thisy 3rd day using it and everything I just like a brand new iPhone 5s no regrets here for the price I got it...... so far.,5
"As of November 2015 this phones memory is just about full. 16 GB is simply NOT enough space....and I'm not a big ""apps"" person, but I do like to save my pictures. Otherwise I have no complaints.",4
"I just received this ""unlocked"" iphone 5s two days ago and was happy until I but I tried to put my sim card in. No service so I called my carrier T-Mobile and oh guess what the phone has a carrier lock on it with guess who T-Mobile. Needless to say I'm pissed and without a phone or money and have yet to get a reply or a refund. ZERO STARS!!!",1
"It all came in a sealed box, the phone was new and works great. My only problem was that the part that connects to the wall to charge doesn't work too well so I had to use a different connector.",5
The phone goes on and off on its own. It also says that the battery is charged and goes dead anytime. I will never purchase a phone from this person ever again. I brought for my daughter cannot call me at times because phone goes dead on its own and with battery says it on 64%.😡,1
"Though fully packaged, it is not totally new.Checking on the Apple support (the Apple web), it says this phone's Telephone Technical Support has already EXPIRED, and only 1 months to Repairs and Service Coverage Expiration Date. Which means it registered about 1 years ago.",2
"Came on time, but a little skeptical about whether or not it was actually new.Other than that the product works great and I'm using it to type this review right now!",5
"Scam, the phone was barred off the network after 1 week due to ""Unpaid payments in the T-Mobile payment plan"", returned immediately to amazon. I'm very disappointed.",1
Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,1
Real iphone 5s. Came in factory box sealed up like an apple store would sell it to you. It has some better features than the 4 and is ALOT faster! I like it! I sanded down my old sim card for my 4 and it fit in my 5 (save $10-20 on a sim card at tmobile),5
"Had to return the phone. After 10 days of the phone, phone became blocked and could not be used. The phone came out of service and couldn't not be used to call or text.",1
"I read a couple of bad reviews, but my experience its been great. I got a brand new IPhone, in a sealed box with all the accessories and works perfectly fine.",5
"Great customer service! I love my new phone! And the best part is I got it from a really good price! Other places were charging me almost 1,000 for this phone but I got it here for 600. I'm very pleased. Thank you.",5
"This is a very good iphone model. There is a problem that hopefully gets resolved later. If you accidentally push the bottom center button to long, it goes into voice over mode that is difficult to get out of!",4
Great Phone!!! Great phone to have in our system. This phone is also feel like is one of our part in our body system. I really enjoy this phone. Without this phone I feel like handicapped.,5
I am super happy with this vendor. The Iphone came in super fast before it was suposeto and it was almost brand new and it works. It was the best purchase I've made. My son is super happy! Thanks,5
"Don't waste your money on this phone. I bought this phone a month ago and I kept getting this blue screen, then it reboots itself over and over again. Doesn't work well with T-Mobile like it said, I tried sending it back but they won't take it back. One month into my iPhone and I'm now looking to buy another phone.",1
"Probably could've found better prices , also the battery drains fast a few weeks after I bought it, recenty just shut down for no reason when it was at 70% .",3
"Perfect perfect perfect! My phone came right on time. I got it and it was like new just as he said. He also sent a charger and a cute pink otter box which was great, because I didn't have to go out and buy one. Thanks!!",5
"i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs though.

Serious problems with the phone. Isnt compatible with tmobile but says in the factory settings that the carrier is tmobile. Also isn't unlocked like they claim to be. Don't buy the phone it's just a huge hassle,1
Phone arrived quickly as described and worked great for a week. After a day bouncing between Apple and my carrier Apple replaced the phone for a new one. The new phone lasted a week and I had to make another appointment with Apple and they replaced that phone. Quality control could be better. Has all the bells and whistle to keep my daughter happy.,4
Came on time but the charger did not work and did not come with headphones or any manuals. It also did not come with the little key to open the sim slot,3
Amazing quality. I knew what i was receiving because i already owned an iphone 5S. Unexpected fast delivery. Definitely will buy again ( if i break this one..haha),5
"I got it for my out-of-town daughter, so aside from doing the initial setup, I really don't know how it's working out for her. But my brief experience with it was just fine.",5
"love the phone but not the battery. the battery was so damaged and abused that i had to go get it replaced. also, they sent me a nasty otterbox that was beyond the point of no return with how dirty it was.",3
"One star, only because I can't give it ZERO. The phone is a Japanese model, which is fine if you have to conform to Japanese laws. I'm not Japanese nor do I live in Japan. Right away I noticed several features I was unable to turn off because of the model of the phone. Entirely unhappy with this purchase.",1
"just get the phone ,almost brandnew, no any scratch on the screen or back cover, love it, better then the iPhone 4 what i bought last year. btw, the cable and earphone are orighnal as well, not the cheap copy.",5
"To start with when I took the phone into the store to get it switched with the old one the numbers off of the new box were not good. But when we got the phone out charged it and used the numbers off of it, it worked ok. So at first I was a little heaitant that it was real. It all worked out in the long run though.",4
What can I say! I amSuper pleased . Arrived befor time set on amazon. Seller kept in touch w mePersonally To tell me about items I bought. Explained what I Was goingTo receive Very clear and was very helpful! Christmas presents for my kids they are very happy . THANK YOU!,5
"I'm still using this iphone now after purchasing it months ago, but the fingerprint unlocking mechanism stopped working less than a month in. It's a fine phone but I wish that aspect of it hadn't quit so soon.",4
"Be sure to check out to confirm the phone is fully working within the 30 days. If not, no refund or credit. We purchased a phone and it completely died within (6) months. Should have just bought it through my cell company. I feel for the price I paid, it should work a lot longer.",2
"The I-phone met all my expectations related to appearance, however the battery is weak and does not hold charge very well, and I am a very light user, it will need a new battery soon which is an extra $50 !",4
"Mobile phone appearance at a line still, there is a slight scratches, can accept, but found that the battery is charging when use more than 300 times, for it is not satisfied",2
"Said the phone was in 'Good' condition. There was one tiny pinprick of a scratch on the back, but other than that it is flawless. This company is good. It was also simple to activate.",5
"I was told that this iPhone would work with the Verizon network, but it is for AT&T instead. Otherwise I would love it because the seller was really accommodating and the price was great.",4
"Had it for 4 months now and no issues thankfully. I'm giving 5 stars because it's exactly what it described it as. Some normal wear & tear, but it works well and hasn't let me down yet.",5
"I was expecting to get a phone with a few scratches, but the phone was like new. There were no problems getting it set up and it's working perfectly. I purchased the phone for my son and he's very happy with it.",5
"I was hesitant about buying this phone online, but it came better than expected. Clean with no scratches and works great. I inserted my SIM card and was using it instantly.",5
This product came in great with no scratches on it! The only issue I had was that I have to leave my cellular data turned on at all times in order for the iMessaging to work. (I just turn on the cellular data and shut it off for all the apps I have so they don't use up all my data),5
Great phone. Did not look used hardly at all. Worked very well. We just took the sim card from the old Verizon Samsung and put it in this one. Very seamless!,5
"It's good, but not as like new as described in condition like new.I think described as very good condition is more reasonable because there are some black points in the back of the cellphone and little scratch in the side.Whatever I'm satisfied with the shopping with the price to get this phone.",3
"The quality of the product was actually better than I expected, and the delivery also arrived earlier than the projected date which was a plus for me.",5
"The charger, headphone and cable are not original manufacturing. When I try the lightening cable. The handset display ""May not support"". Of course you can avoid that by another side of connector. I think it's good purchasing experience for me. But amazon should improve the quality of peripherals.",4
Very pleased with purchase. The details of the phone noted minor scratches. When I received the phone it looked brand new. It came with new accessories. Highly recommended.,5
What can I say? The phone was FAKE. I took it to Verizon & they tried & tried. We were there for hours. End result- it's NOT A REAL IPHONE. This was my 12 year olds birthday gift.. Shame on these people.,1
"Upgrade for my wife from tracfone, took it to Verizon Corporate store for setup, ready to go in 15 minutes. Ported her old # over. Screen is too small for me (my iPhone 6s is easier for me to see) . Bought this refurbished from Noble Planet after looking at their history. I'm very happy with Noble Planet and with this phone.",4
"The phone overall works fine, but I Just didn't like that it came with headphones and not a charger. The screen was really dirty when I opened the box too. I just say never take a picture of stuff that isn't going to be included. False advertising!!",3
"This phone was a promised by the seller. I actually thought I had an issue with the phone and the seller went over the top to help me. The most amazing seller I have ever dealt with. As far as the phone, my daughter LOVES it!",5
"Went to Verizon Corp store, put the sim card in, turned it on and was up and running in minutes. Completed OS upgrade in 20 minutes, restored iCloud data and was good to go.",4
"Very pleased. I love it. I was expecting more scratches because of shipping but only one or two on back. A small dent on the top of the phone but not noticable in the picture. I would recommend getting this phone, you will not regret it!",5
"Well unfortunately my my phone went swimming and I was forced to decide between buying a new phone for $600 or buy a used one. I got an iPhone 5s in mint condition for less than $200 shipped to my door step in just a few days. Very pleased, would highly recommend this phone and for anybody facing the same situation as me",5
Phone came in mail pretty reasonably but the phone won't turn on or take a charge...seller obviously didn't check to make sure it worked before sending it out. They are based out of Brooklyn so I'm sure they are a lot of shady stores there.,1
This cell phone was easy to start up with Verizon. I bought this phone for my daughter who lives out of state so our family could stay connected. My daughter loves this phone.,5
"Bought this phone for my teenager after getting tired of spending ridiculous amounts of money on the ""latest and greatest"". I have had no regrets. The iPhone has worked great and saved me hundreds of dollars over the price of the latest iPhone.",5
"I bought an used - like new one. There are little scratch, but I like it very much. I used it for some days, there was not any problem. But the battery cyclecounts are 292 times, very high rate. So 3 stars.",3
"The phone was nice, but the used model sent came with a broken proximity sensor and the home button was a little funky. We returned it and went through Verizon for a brand new phone instead.",3
The shipping was on time. It said it would be here Friday by 8pm I got it Friday at 10am. Took the phone to Verizon to activate it and it works! Very pleased and very pleased with the price I paid for a good phone!,5
"Haven't activated this phone yet, as it is a Christmas gift, but the phone is in great condition (as described). So far, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Will update this review, if it is necessary.Update: We absolutely love this phone and I am very satisfied with the purchase.",5
I bought this phone and then receive a iPhone 5! Not a 5s. Just a 5. I get it. The battery percentage is wrong so my phone shuts off at 35%. My touch screen lags and fidgets all the time. And my microphone hardly works. This company is terrible! Don't ever buy from them!!!,1
"I received the phone. The screen was loose. The digitizer was non- responsive. It looked like it was put together in a backyard shack, by a bunch of blind elves. Simply put. It's junk.",1
"They may say its a new screen, but its replaced with a third party aftermarket screen that is not OEM.Apple refuses to service any iphone that has an aftemarket screen.",1
The phone arrived in pristine condition to replace an iPhone 4 my daughter had soaked. It just needed the replacement sim card. I have one and love it for all the features and compact size--easy to slip in a pocket and yet very readable.,5
Screen started going out shortly after activating the phone. Took it to the apple store to hear that it needs a whole new screen. It is now fully understood why the phone was put up for sale to begin with.,1
"Great form finish, metal and glass feel phenomenal. Cases don't add too much bulk due to already minimal dimensions. Fantastic phone& reliable operating system. Would definitely recommend even in 2016.",5
"Though the phone barely has any scratches or mishandling marks, the iPhone I received has a bad case of ghost tapping. Minus this annoying factor, the iPhone runs smoothly and the battery last as long as any other iPhone.",3
"The operating system failed within 4 months, beyond repair. The warranty with the seller was just 30 days. Very unfriendly return/exchange policy for an expensive item one expects to last at least a couple of years. SELLER/PRODUCT NOT RECOMMENDED.",1
"Although the phone itself was good, it turns out to be a non-verizon machine. which doesn't work with verizon simcard. I think they didn't test it. before selling.",1
"Excellent phone, in flawless condition. Not one single problem and got my phone a few day's earlier than expected... Highly recommend cellcow to all....",5
"So much faster than my iPhone 4s.Everything came in the box... iPhone, charging cable and plug, Verizon sim card, earplugs. I took it to Verizon to switch over to my new iPhone 5s but the rep in the store told me that I could have done the setup at home. :)",5
"Bought this from Best Price Phones or kugs8989, in February - listed as NEW. Today, June 6, the battery is dead and will not hold a charge. Seller has disappeared. I've had the same model of phone since it was first issued in 2013, and it is still going strong.",1
"The screen had a couple of glitches with brightness initially, but it seems to have resolved and is working well. I would purchase a new phone with this seller again.",4
Major cons: (not negotiable)- speaker phone function is roughly 50% of how loud it needs to be. Makes listening to music or talking to people using the speaker pointless without headphones- Bluetooth function will not even display other devices to link to. Completely inoperable Bluetooth capabilityPros:-clean screen with little scratches or dings,1
I bought a refurbished phone and it came in on time. Works very well and since its a refurbished phone then there is still some very light scratched on the side but it doesn't bother me. Overall good buy. Nice camera quality!,5
"I'll give em a thumbs up. As I will say,they went above & beyond to resolve the error of receiving an incorrect item by error. Impressed with the customer service response & pleased with the product once received.",4
This is my 3rd refurbished iPhone from Amazon and I'm very happy. Works great. You can't beat the price and they always guarantee that they work well.,5
"Not too happy with this item. Say you can have connected with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile but no sim card came with it, price out rages, and can't get it hock up for a phone use. So very unhappy as it took a long time to try all the different cell phone companies and nothing unless we buy a Sims card and still nothing. This was bull.",2
Purchased this phone brand new and it's amazing better than I expected it to be. I had concerns that it wouldn't be as good as it looks but it was great and not sure why there are bad reviews about the company selling it?,5
"My iPhone arrived sealed in the box. Everything was perfect! I needed mine for Verizon Wireless, so I can't say if it was unlocked or not. The phone had all the accessories it was supposed to come with and everything works well. I am pleased!",5
"The phone turned out to be a Verizon phone, and was not ""unlocked"" to be used on other networks.This was definitely false advertizing and currently struggling to return it for full refund...do to traveling.",1
"I've had the top of the line Android phones and every single iphone ever and the iphone is the best phone there is and at this rate ever will be...whether it be because of design or performance, it's the better phone.",5
Every function on the phone works well however Bluetooth and wireless are broken. Tried several reboots with the software so it must be a hardware issue. Very disappointing. Not worth the $300+ I paid for it.,2
"Phone worked great for like two weeks. Turns out it wasn't brand new at all, screen started ghost clicking and when I took it to the apple store to use the ""warranty"" it comes with they said it wasn't even new and the warranty wouldn't cover it.",1
"I do not know if these reviews are seller specific but I order the phone from ""Next Level Mobile"" which was labeled as ""new"" after around 3.5 months the display was not working, when I brought it to Apple they said they could not fix the problem because it has been replaced with a ""third party display"".",1
I had ran into a problem with my phone just a week after i had it. i took it to the apple store and they said they couldn't do anything to it because it wasn't an Apple product. It was one of those fake phones from China. now i have to invest in another phone.,1
This product came in earlier than expected. As said in the description this phone did have evidence of usage but if you wear a case on it then you can't see the damage and it looks brand new with a case of it. I love it so much. I would recommend buying this.,5
I bought iphone5s in 2014. but yesterday my earphone was bad.I went to the Apple Store to repair earphone.They told me the earphone is not original earphone.I find I can not find any word in the earphone about Assembled in China.I think you sell me fake accessories！！！I think this is a very serious problem.,1
"Had an iPhone5, went to a Galaxy S5 (hated it), went back to iPhone (5S this time). Performance is noticeably better than the iPhone5 and SO much better than my S5 (especially after the Lollipop update). Battery life much better than S5, too. Love it!",5
Apple IPhone 5S is working perfectly. No problem getting phone connected thru Verizon service and their free SIMM Card. Very happy with Amazon timely service also.Thank you.,4
"Awesome phone. Works perfect, great price point for brand new phone! Couldn't be happier. Customer service was world class. Will definitely buy here again.",5
I'm not sure how I bought this phone for $350 with 64 gigabytes of internal memory but I did ........and it works perfectly on Verizon Wireless.....can't beat it........ came in great condition.....WIFE loves it.,5
I bought iphone5s in 2014. but yesterday my earphone was bad.I went to the Apple Store to repair earphone.They told me the earphone is not original earphone.I find I can not find any word in the earphone about Assembled in China.I think you sell me fake accessories！！！I think this is a very serious problem.,1
"Received my iphone 5s, bought from thegizmogadgets.. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and looks absolutely new, no visible scratch seen, although the battery is a bit used already but it still fine..",5
"very happy with purchase. phone was in very good shape, very little wear apparent. screen and case looked close to perfect. works just as new and NO trouble getting it on my verizon account (no charge). came exactly as described and on time. Id buy from them again.",5
"as advertised. complete with charger and earbuds (earbuds are no as good as the Originals, but it is nice to have them included) Would purchase from seller again",5
I got this product at the end of September and it worked for about 3 weeks until one day lines appeared on the screen and it is now defective. I would not recommend buying this product unless you want a broken iphone.,1
Thrilled to have this iPhone! Still learning how to use it with ALL the features. Don't know what your missing until you have it in your hot little hand. Wonderful machine.,5
"The quality of the product was actually better than I expected, and the delivery also arrived earlier than the projected date which was a plus for me.",5
"Phone arrived sooner than expected. Very clean, no signs of use. So far is working just fine. I use it for Page Plus Cellular and I was able to transfer my old number to this new phone without any problems. Great Phone.",5
"This has been a good purchase. The battery life isn't as good as we hoped. Sometimes it dies with 20% left to go. But for the price we got it, I didn't really expect it to be perfect. Other than that, there have been no problems.",4
"Haven't activated this phone yet, as it is a Christmas gift, but the phone is in great condition (as described). So far, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Will update this review, if it is necessary.Update: We absolutely love this phone and I am very satisfied with the purchase.",5
I bought this phone and then receive a iPhone 5! Not a 5s. Just a 5. I get it. The battery percentage is wrong so my phone shuts off at 35%. My touch screen lags and fidgets all the time. And my microphone hardly works. This company is terrible! Don't ever buy from them!!!,1
"The I-phone met all my expectations related to appearance, however the battery is weak and does not hold charge very well, and I am a very light user, it will need a new battery soon which is an extra $50 !",4
"So far so great! I was a little hesitate buying a refurbished phone, but I have had zero issues! It runs great, hardly any scratches or scuffs and the 64GB of storage is amazing compared to the 8GB of storage I had on my iPhone 4S. Really glad I found this awesome deal on Black Friday!",5
"just get the phone ,almost brandnew, no any scratch on the screen or back cover, love it, better then the iPhone 4 what i bought last year. btw, the cable and earphone are orighnal as well, not the cheap copy.",5
"The online thing was that it did not come with the verizon Sim card like the description leads you to believe. Overall- VERY fast shipping! Phone is brand new as expected, now just to wait for the SIM card so I can enjoy it!",5
"iPhone's battery does not work properly! This was not included in the description. The battery died every 20 minutes unless it was connected to a charger. Once the phone would turn back on, it would say that the battery life was at 30%!",1
"I got this in the mail and it came with a little kit to clean the screen and then a REALLY nice screen protector. It was a nice little surprise. Anyways, I put a phone case on and it looks brand new! It also works great.",5
"Product arrived quickly. Showed signs of minimal wear, just a slight rub mark from when it had been in a case. Was activated thru Verizon online account in a matter of minutes. Functions as expected. No complaints yet, only had it a few days tho. Came in non-factory box, included a new charger in good condition. Pleased with my order.",4
"Terrible. Phone took first charge to 100%. At 30% it went to 0 and turned off. Next charge to %100, then dead after 2 hours. It then wouldn't even take a charge. Garbage",1
"I was disappointed when I received the phone and found out that it is not usable on Verizon, even though it clearly stated in the description that it is a Verizon cell phone.",1
"Phone is OK, but when I use the earbuds with mic, the mic does not work. I notified the company and was sent two new sets of earbuds. One of the sets does not have sound from the left side. Still cannot use the mic with this phone. Disappointed.",3
"I was hesitant about buying this phone online, but it came better than expected. Clean with no scratches and works great. I inserted my SIM card and was using it instantly.",5
"I was very nervous about buying an expensive item from Amazon, but I gave it a try and DO NOT regret it! I got my package in record time and it was exactly, if not better, than what I was hoping.",5
"I needed to upgrade my iPhone 4, and wasn't sure what to go with. Turns out I found a decent price in comparison, and it's everything I wanted and more. Love iPhone!",5
"Not too happy with this item. Say you can have connected with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile but no sim card came with it, price out rages, and can't get it hock up for a phone use. So very unhappy as it took a long time to try all the different cell phone companies and nothing unless we buy a Sims card and still nothing. This was bull.",2

"I'll give em a thumbs up. As I will say,they went above & beyond to resolve the error of receiving an incorrect item by error. Impressed with the customer service response & pleased with the product once received.",4
"The phone came looking fine, but sometimes the screen glitches and isn't coordinated with where I tap, and sometimes just plain old wigs out and does random things when I'm not even touching the screen. But I can't afford the time to not have a phone so I'm just gonna deal with it for now.",3
This product came in earlier than expected. As said in the description this phone did have evidence of usage but if you wear a case on it then you can't see the damage and it looks brand new with a case of it. I love it so much. I would recommend buying this.,5
"Everything was as described, very little wear overall (phone was a little dirty but it cleaned up like new with a little rubbing alcohol). It arrived on time, activation went smoothly and the phone is in great working order. 10/10 would order again.",5
"this is my first smartphone,,s0,,, it will take some time to learn how to use,,battery goes dead in 24 hours with very limited use---that sucks---phone was as listed,, looks good,, works good, i guess",5
"I received the phone. The screen was loose. The digitizer was non- responsive. It looked like it was put together in a backyard shack, by a bunch of blind elves. Simply put. It's junk.",1
"They may say its a new screen, but its replaced with a third party aftermarket screen that is not OEM.Apple refuses to service any iphone that has an aftemarket screen.",1

"It's really good! But sometimes, it doesn't find good signal! I don't know why... If it's the cellphone, or if it's the carrier! The product is amazing, what I had found",4
We are very satisfied with our purchase. The dealer answered questions promptly and communicated with professionalism. would definitely recommend people purchase from this site and this dealer. will be purchasing again soon. Product exceeded my expectations. very satisfied.,5
"Phone came in the mail dead with a scratch on the screen. Once I charged it up and tried it out, multiple letters on the keyboard did not work. To top it off, after one day of owning this ""good conditioned"" iPhone, the screen went completely bizarre. Terrible seller.",1
excellent condition and working perfect. Don't do an upgrade from your carrier to get a phone because it went bad. I'm happy with this and I'm not in another 2 yr contract with AT&T,5
This phone came in great shape. No visible scratches at all. We had no problems at all getting Sprint service added. And so far no problems and works great. So glad we bought this phone at such a great price.,5
This phone has worked great for me for two years now. I also hate cases and have dropped it a thousand times preparing myself for the worst when I pick it up and it's still in great condition.,5
Shh .. This is a Christmas Gift from Santa Clause! This phone arrived before the due date & get this .. It came with EXTRAS that wasn't even mentioned or known! I was exstatic when I opened the package & saw everything so I definitely know my recipient of this gift will be too!!!,5
"This phone has been exactly what I expected and wanted. Moreover, the seller was fantastic, did a great job of transferring the phone, packing and shipping securely and promptly.",5
"My wife's iPhone 4 died and she wanted a new one, but didn't want to commit to another 2-year contract. I bought this new from Amazon for $250 less than what Sprint would charge me.",5
"I'm writing this review after using the phone over a year. It was easy to hook up w sprint right out of the box, and has been working well for me since Dec 2015. I can upgrade to a new phone now but haven't because there is no need -this refurbished phone still functions without noticeable hiccups.",5
Item was ok.WARNING: IT does not come with a SIM card. Must have a SIM card from the carrier to be able to activate/ use it. Had to order a nano SIM card to make it work (still waiting on those to be delivered),2
"I love it. I never had an iPhone before and I am so glad I bought this one. It is just like new and I have seen others like this on ""sale"" for over $500.00 so I got a great deal.",5
The phone they sent me was manufactured for sale in Japan (or another similar country) and thus I cannot shut off the camera shutter sound. It's very annoying.,2
"Shipped perfectly. Using flawlessly for months on end. Would suggest buying a SIM card with it unless you live close to a Spring store, I had to make three trips to get it working properly. However, that isn't the buyer's fault, Sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10",5
I was very excited to receive the phone in a short amount of time and to see it was basically brand new and had some charge in it so I could activate it right away! I was also very happy that it came with not 1 but 2 chargers!,5
this phone has disabled me more times than i can say in the short time i have had it. if i could return this phone i would..very unhappy w this phone...,2
"Appearance of the phone was perfect, unfortunately after 93 days of ownership the video blew out. There was no physical damage to the phone, it just stopped functioning and does not appear repairable.",1
"No complaints, people should read and understand what they going to buy before they start complaining, got my phone in very good condition, for the price and very honest services..",5
I was skeptical about ordering a used iPhone but I am thrilled with the phone I received. It is in perfect condition and exactly as advertised. Not a flaw on it that I can see. The SIM card from my old phone was too big. I took it to an ATT store and they cut it to fit. No charge. My phone was working the same day I received it.,5
Overall a nice little phone though the antennae seems a little week to me. I was up in the mountains near my home and my sons cheap go phone had better reception. Both phones are AT&T...,4
"Came as claimed. Near flawless condition... I couldn't find anything wrong with it if I tried. Only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum... No apple logo or and writing, at all. But it grew on me its very sleek. Phone operates as expected and is lightning fast. I would suggest to anyone.",5
Terrible! It is a Sprint phone and they couldn't turn it on. I tried to return it but never heard back from the seller. Then I tried to unlock it and have T-Mobile turn it on. They couldn't do it either. This was a waste of my money!!!!,1
"As far as the iPhone goes I like it. As far as this particular one, the screen is sometimes unresponsive requiring a restart. Not cool.update. downgrading to one star. it quit on me last night. it is still on, but the screen wont come on. am having to return it and I cant even wipe it before i do. not cool.",1
"Arrived on time, quick shipment! The phone arrived in its original box & factory sealed by Apple. Received my order in less than 24 hours. Plus I got it for a great price! Highly recommended!",5
I am sorry I never wrote a review for you when you I purchased this. Phone was exactly as described and works great. We some issues getting it set up because it was still on the buyers apple account. The buyer worked fast on getting it removed and we were able to add to our provider within two days. Thank You!,5
Ok I bought this iPhone now I can't activate it I am desipointed . I need this unlock now they say that there is no unlock code for this phone .pls if u are buying an iPhone make sure it is unlock this was s wast of my time and money. I am KENDAL HANNA a dissatisfied customer,1
"Brand new in sealed box, as promised. Minor complaint -- this must be from a foreign market, because the charger and brick in the box is not a US plug. Seller included a US plug in the amazon box, but its a generic charging cable and brick, not apple. Otherwise, very happy with the product.",5
"One of three phones I bought this month from Amazon third-party because of ""drowned"" phones. This was one was as described (or better). Shipping was very fast! Very satisfied so far!",5
"After some issues, not by the seller, the Item was as described. It's perfect! And they gave me a car charger and two phones cases for the mishap. Thank you!",5
My son does not get the best of signal when at home or in small town areas. But overall he seems to enjoy this phone and has no other complaint. Package came as promised and delivered late due to a mix up but was refunded the shipment before phone arrived. Overall very satisfied,4
"Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service.",1
Ordered three of these phones and non of them would connect to Sprint's network. Sprint told me that they were incompatible with their system. They were also not new phones and were refurbished.,1
I have not even had this phone for a month and now the home button does not work!! Have not dropped it I don't know why it just stopped working from one day to the next very disappointed!! Also the screen on the side looks like it is about to pop out any minute!!,1
"Recently purchased this iPhone about 1 month or 2 months ago, sometimes it decides not to charge and then screen frezzes. its a ""NEW"" iPhone but its giving me problems..",3
currently very very pleased with this phone!! i bought it refurbished and it is like brand new. i have had no problems so far and hope i don't have to encounter any.,5
"This item came very fast. I was disappointed when they told me it will arrive in a week, but so happy and overwhelmed when it arrived in two days without PRIME connection. The iPhone works perfectly and don't regret purchasing. Best thing I've bought!",5
"Amazing phone. I woke up the next morning after using the phone, I named her Siri; and she made me coffee. I come home from work and all my clothes are folded and put away nicely. What an amazing phone the 5S is. The only problem is we can't take a shower together, something about the water Siri doesn't like. I love my 5S. <3",5
Very disapionted as I'm in Australia and the fone can't be used I understood fone locked for sprint but would axept overseas sim for use out side the states stuck with a fone that the carriers won't unlock,1
"The phone I got was highly used, many dinks on the side. the front touch screen was replaced with after market junk. The touch screen stopped working after two weeks. The wifi and LTE data also slowed to a crawl. I don't recommend a used iPhone.",1
I just got my new iphone 5s Today it came in the iPhone 5s gold box and looked brand new! Everything is in tact no scratches or any screen problems at all! Shipping also came very early. My predicted shipping was 5-110 days after my purchase and it came two days from after i put my order in!,5
Had the phone for 6 months and had no problem. So much faster than any android I ever had the music thing is annoying but you get used to downloading songs of iTunes lol.,5
Great phone! I've had the 4 and the 4s and the 5s is amazing! So slim and fast and there is definitely a BIG difference in the phone compared to the 4/4s. Absolutely love apple and iOS 7. And I'm in love with the gold color!,5
"I have sold my Apple iPhone 5s 16GB, as I needed an UNBLOCKED unit, and although I thought I was bying an unblocked version, it turned out that I wasn't. I have since acquired the same machine, here in South Africa, and it is the best thing that I have ever acquired!!!!",1
"The phone was shipped quickly, however I received the iPhone 5 instead of the 5s model that the title and description state it is. Needed a new phone as soon as possible so I didn't return the item. It works great and looked brand new. I'm just disappointed I didn't get what I thought I was paying for.",3
The product came in less than a week. It was in perfect condition and was as described. I was able to activate the phone immediately with no issues what so ever.,5
"The phone does not hold a charge for over 3 hours, the auto rotate function does not work, the compass does not funtion. To sum it up, if I were to have a second chance I would NOT buy a used phone here.",1
This phone was in great condition I have had it for about a month now and I haven't had any problems it was a great purchase great price all around great,5
It arrived sealed in the box phone works and looks great the Apple iPhone 5s is extremely easy to use I actually purchased it for my twelve year old daughter and she has not put it down it was a great gift for her,5
The home button made a clicking sound every time i pressed it and it took a fall and the back camera went out i pulled it apart fixed but forgot to put something on it and then it wouldnt turn on the motherboard went but that was my fault really,3
"This was a upgrade from the 5c. The only issue i had was that this phone did not come with a SIM card, but the nice guy i called at ATT told me what to do, and this phone works like a charm! i am SO happy!The phone was in excellent shape, one minor blemish that is easily ignored (or covered with a sparkly phone case).",5
"This phone was horrible. Within a few months, it was completely useless. It glitches out all the time, I couldn't even write a text message. Huge waste of money.",1
This phone is the right size and as is fast!! It was purchased for my son's birthday. He is happy with this phone. My son prefers the smaller phones and this works for him as some larger ones like the iPhone 6 and 7 are too big for his taste.,5
"Works great! Does not uncles SIM card but you can purchase one online or through a phone call. Perfect screen. Very minimal marks on the back, but if you use a case it looks brand new.",5
"This Iphone product didn't meet my expectations at all. There were many damages around the phone casing, and the main speaker, on the front screen, wasn't working properly. Also the phone over-heats; not to mention the battery life drains faster than usual.",1
"Phone is a bit more quirky than I'd hoped, touchscreen seems to lose letters and motions here and there, but I think that's just iOS8 being weird, hopefully it'll get better with the next update.",4
Was doing really good. Now this week my screens are freezing up i have to push home button and turn back on to get messages or my square. sometimes freezes up while i am using it. is a pain to use square to collect money for my sales and turn off and on couple of times to complete a transaction.,3
"this item arrived perfectly fine, on time and it looked great on the outside but the part where it charges the phone was old, moldy and burnt, and there is no way to fix it. I wasted $250.",1
"It looked good, but the battery is shot and it won't charge very fast. Now we are stuck. That was all her Christmas money. Don't buy used! Or refurbished...it took an hour and a half in the Sprint store to get all the updates loaded.",2
I love the form factor. Just the right size for my needs. The 6 was too large for someone who usually keeps the phone in his pocket. The extra memory means I'll never run out of room for apps and pics. Plenty fast even with the new OS.,5
Awesome Used Product.. No Flaw except some hazy look on screen when its screen is off.. Outer body dont have a single scratch and phone is running without any issue,4
The phone has been to the AT&T store twice and help from Apple Support . It may have serious problems. Not sure iif I should send it back or give it more time.,2
"Good price. Phone is immaculate. Fast delivery. No issues. Love the phone, much better than the 5c I had. Touch ID is a nice feature. Wonderful camera.",5
"Great, connection is lost at times but maybe the connection is due to ATT. Didn't come with charger like supposed to. But works great. Came charged. Almost new.",4
"Very good used iphone 5s. Product came exactly as described in product details. Good batter life, cosmetic condition. And shipping was fast after an initial wait period.",5
"A friend asked me to order this item, the phone came with no charger, screen corners are darker than usual, ICCID says unknown and I paid $189 for this. I want my money back ASAP, pleassse somebody.",1
This phone is absolutely amazing & this is the first iPhone I've ever had :). The battery is better than Android because I only need to charge it every 2 days instead of everyday. It's very well designed & I'll stick with Apple for a very long time haha.,3
I'am very satisfied with purchasing my new phone. Everything described was exactly true about the conditions of the phone which looks practically new. I would reccomend anyone to get their phone with them :),5
So far this phone has been exactly what I wanted it for! It was nice to get an Iphone for a lower price and not have to shell out the big bucks!A few times the phone has had some glitches but it worked after restarting it. But overall what I wanted!!,4
Phone works and was in really good condition the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I ordered a silver iphone and recieved the space grey iphone.,4
"Sprint refused to activate this phone on a pre-paid plan. We ended up returning it. The phone itself appeared unused and in the original box. However, it did not have the Apple factory seal on the box so was apparently not ""new"".",2
I purchased this phone and had contact with seller to make sure it's a att phone. They said yes. Well went to att and it's not an att phone. They checked it and it will not accept simple card from att.,1
Phone looks great does as expected. Sadly the battery is useless. After fully charging it still dies within two hours. Now that should have been stated in the sale listing too. Now off to buy a battery!!! I don't like dishonesty or failure to disclose. especially when it comes to this sort of item.,2
I wish I could give this 0 stars.The phone is dirty and cracked up. It looks like its been through hell and back.This phone has water damage and the screen is blur.I demand a refund this is going back.,1
I ordered the phone on the Monday night (the night I broke my phone and couldn't use it) and it arrived on Friday. The phone looks great and works well. Thank you for your swift service and delivery.,5
"Got this for my daughter for her birthday, was listed as good condition but it was practically brand new just didn't have a box. Super fast shipping! Thank you",5
"I didn't read all description, so I thought that the product was available for all phone carriers. When I wanted to activate with other carrier and I couldn't do that, I reread the complete description and understood which was my problem.",4
"I was scared to buy a phone online because I didn't want it to be broken, but I'm so happy this phone is perfect. Works great no scratches. Very friendly, buy their stuff!",5
"i could not insert a nano sim chip then i do not know if works. I noticed that if you buy the 64 GB from the apple store for Tmobile is cheaper than this one, also is unlocked. I didn't know about that.",3
I purchased the phone used for $350 and have been using it for the past month. I recommend the phone at this price point.Pros:Good cameraTouch ID is accurate and convenientGood 4 inch sizeFast processorPurchased 1 year used and it still works wellIt runs iOS 8.1Cons:Home button works but has a small clicking sound.No Apple pay/ NFC,5
It was unblocked and never been unblocked. Charger was so dirty and disgusting! I could not finalize talk to seller who promised to unlock the phone but never did,1
"this is a great phone! It arrived in perfect, new condition. No SIM card, but Apple took care of that quickly and with no charge. It arrived quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas",5
"Not sure about a used phone in this price range, but very happy with the cost and it is much better condition than expected. Already past the 30-days and no problems. Works great. I will buy more phones like this.",5
"Very undone. Speaker was blown, front facing had to replaced as well as the battery after I found out it was an aftermarketed replacement that was too thick for the facing to seat correctly. Overall spent over $200 to have it in basic standings",1
There wasn't a SIMS card with it. Which my have been my fault for not double checking out reading through everything. I'm not sure they advertised no SIM card though. But it was in great shape and exactly what I was looking for. No scratches or problems either. Also the charger they sent me didn't work.,3
"the phone works great, but i did have to get the power cord replaced shortly after receiving it. but the apple store gave it to me for free because it was still under warrenty",4
"I was hesitant about purchasing this phone but I'm glad I did! The phone got here 1 day earlier than I expected, it looks almost new, everything works great, and it came with the charging cables! Very happy with my purchase!",5
"It got here fast, order got here in 2 days standard shipping. I love it, looks new came in IPhone box with ear buds, and charger. Could not have ask for anything better. Will recommend to everybody. Thanks for the phone!",5
IT was not totally fine. It has a rattle like the insides don't quite fit tightly. I am having some issues with it not responding to internet quickly. But this does not happen all the time.,3
"I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED!",1
Ordered this as a gift for my daughter's 17th birthday and so far she's in love with it. Everything was as described and it even arrived earlier than expected!,5
"My apologies - I didn't know that my phone is synced with my hearing aids - and, therefore, ""blue tooth"" is on all the time. So, that is causing the battery to run down faster than I'm used to. The phone is just fine and the vendor was most cooperative.",4
"I bought this Iphone because I wanted to use it in Mexico but it doesn't work, on the website description said that It just works in US just with sprint but in others countries it would work totally fine like Mexico, so I would like to return it.",1
Its permanently locked to Sprint and I am travelling to a different country. Now I am not able to use it as its locked.This information was missing during the time of purchase.,1
"Phone does not say percentage by the battery, caused me problems when I was restoring it. Charger is FAKE. Not pleased because of that. The phone is also causing me problems with music. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate the phone a 6.",3
"I have had some erratic incidents that I had not had with my previous 5s. Eventually they went away, but it has caused me to question the product or the source a bit.",3
"As far as the iPhone goes I like it. As far as this particular one, the screen is sometimes unresponsive requiring a restart. Not cool.update. downgrading to one star. it quit on me last night. it is still on, but the screen wont come on. am having to return it and I cant even wipe it before i do. not cool.",1
"The product is marked as like new, but the mobilephone i received screen scratches.And the top of the screen will be dented with a little strength,use my hand.",3
My new iphone 5s arrived ahead of schedule. My iphone 5s arrived in very good condition without any incidents. The price was just right.Now I can purchase my iwatch. Thanks James Thom,5
"I did not realize that the phone was not unlocked and made ​​the mistake to buy it for the Sprint company. I live in Argentina , and wanted to know if you know any way to unlock it or I can send some code to do it?",4
"Bought this phone to replace 4S, but have had nothing but trouble. The camera only works toward the texter, not out the back the right way. My I tunes and computer do not recognize it at all. How do I get a refund?",1
"Paid almost $20 extra for overnight shipping, phone came 4 days later, plugged in the charger n it started smoking. Phone it's self was as advertised and works fine just wish it was a better overall experience.",3
"Came as advertised, put in the SIM Card, registered phone with provider, syncd with ITunes and was up in no time at all. Was a new locked phone for Sprint and couldn't have worked any better. Quick delivery, excellent product and I couldn't be happier.",5
bought this used from amazon. was worried about it not working or missing a cable but it came with new everything except an apple box. sure beats buying a new one for close to $1000. works great and its new to me.,5
"Was advertised as a refurbished phone. But it was used not refurbished. Refurbished almost always have a new shell. But are to definitely be fully tested. More rigorous testing than new products. However, this phone was scratched up. And microphone is not working at 100%. As others he me as muffled.",2
"This was an amazing upgrade for us since we were still using a 3Gs. I would prefer a more solid battery, and I wish that voice control/siri could function w/o internet access but other than that; it's a good product at this price point.",4
I was skeptical about ordering a used iPhone but I am thrilled with the phone I received. It is in perfect condition and exactly as advertised. Not a flaw on it that I can see. The SIM card from my old phone was too big. I took it to an ATT store and they cut it to fit. No charge. My phone was working the same day I received it.,5
"Mine works perfectly! I have yet to find any scratches on the screen, so it's in great condition! Plus, I have over 2500 songs and tons of apps on my phone now and I still have about 38 GB of free space! I am EXTREMELY pleased!",5
This phone works great at first I thought it was defective because it would not turn on but I found out that the lock switch was on which would not let the phone charge or turn on after I turned that off the phone works like brand new great deal for the price,5
The phone came in alright condition. It has scratches and dings on. BUT it does not come with a SIM and it is not clearly noted on the description. Make sure you have a SIM because it's a huge pain to get one! Two to three weeks shipping for me.,3
"this is a great phone! It arrived in perfect, new condition. No SIM card, but Apple took care of that quickly and with no charge. It arrived quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas",5
"The phone did not come unlocked as advertised. When the package was delivered, it was stated in the bill that was locked onto the AT&T Network, not Factory Unlocked as advertised.",3
Worst thing ever..... Ordered the home thinking I was gonna be able to use it.... And turns out it was for the wrong carrier as described in the ad. I was very upset... This is the first time something like this has ever happened.,1
before ordering the iphone 5s i was like man whats the point of touch id it sounds like a stupid gimmick. in reality its a great tool for phone security because people don't see you put in your password. I also like that it's faster to log into my phone.,5
"I've had this phone for about two months now and I absolutely love it! It's a great phone. One problem though, the brightness sometimes changes by itself even with auto-brightness turned off. Other than that, it's a great phone.",5
I purchased this phone from the seller and when I received it I was unable to use it. I invested alot of time and money trying to fix it and couldn't. The seller would not communicate with me about the phone when I was trying to fix it so it was returned to seller. My experience with this product was very stressful to say the least.,1
"The item is exactly as it was described and shipping was as expected, by far the best thing I have bought on Amazon. The price was a lot but it's bc it's practically brand new, but it was totally worth all the money I spent on ift, I love it!!",5
I just got my new iphone 5s Today it came in the iPhone 5s gold box and looked brand new! Everything is in tact no scratches or any screen problems at all! Shipping also came very early. My predicted shipping was 5-110 days after my purchase and it came two days from after i put my order in!,5
Had the phone for 6 months and had no problem. So much faster than any android I ever had the music thing is annoying but you get used to downloading songs of iTunes lol.,5
"the phone speakers broke after a month and a half. do not buy from them. they are a 3rd party who ""fixes"" phones with tape to hold parts together. buying from them was the biggest mistake of my life. i thought they were posing as apple and sold me a crapy phone. THEY ARE FAKE!!!! DO NOT TRUST THEM!!!!",1
I really really LOOVVEEE this iPhone ! 😍😍 thank you soooooooooooooooo much ! I couldn't ask for Better . and for a cheap price ? this is excellent . it looks brand new but you have to buy your own charger and box AND headphones but the phone is still worth it ! make sure you charge the phone before you deliver it though . :/,5
"I love my phone and it is in great condition but it is an Iphone 5 not a 5S and I payed for a 5S not a 5. The shipping and the quality of the phone was great, but I wanted a 5S.",2
"Phone I got was in decent visual condition. However, battery does not last with more than 1 hour of use. Also, after 3 days the speaker stopped working. Buyer beware, these are junk refurbished phones.",1
"When this phone arrived, it either wasn't unlocked or wasn't an ATT compatible phone which is what we supposedly bought. It won't activate on our line which makes it basically pointless.",1
The sound did not work properly which makes it hard if you can't hear text messages or people when you answer the phone. First and foremost it must work as a phone. Customer service was great at facilitating returns but it would have been nice to double check everything before shipping things out.,1
"Arrived early and came as described (minor imperfections on back surface). My sister lost her previous sprint iPhone & this is for her birthday! Hopefully, easy set-up with sprint...",4
"I bought it as new but when i get it today and opened it it was used and broken, i did not activated it yet going to do it tomorrow hope it will work i am very upset.",1
I was hoping this wouldn't be a crApple product but after less than 2 months of use the phone shuts off randomly & as of lately refusing to boot up for hours.This is absolutely disgusting.,1
I ordered another IPhone before this one & was given one with scratches & the lock screen did not work. This one came as explained in the bio! Works great came in mint condition I love my IPhone!,5
"I needed to recieve this by Christmas as a gift for my boyfriend and did! The seller has great communication via email, and inturn was able to provide ideal customer service. The product is working great and my boyfriend had the best christmas ever. Thank you!",5
"I bought this iphone the other day and I am absolutely in love. Everything came as described. I had the iphone 4s prior to this phone and was inneed of a upgrade, Im very satisfied with the iphone 5s, battery lasts much longer and the camera is way better on this phone. I recommend people to order this phone from here, it really is worth it!",5
Product is great and meet my expatations of a telephone what is needed to experience the modern world. Maybe wen ordered from Europe the adapter can be fit to match the european electricity outlets.Regards Peter,5
"I had the iPhone 4S before and was waiting to upgrade to a newer version but didn't really see the need with the iPhone 5, I'm so glad I waited because I'm in love with my new phone. It came just as it was described and the seller communicated with me in reguards to any questions I had, I would deffenately buy from this seller again in the future.",5
"Phone was in excellent condition. The price and the quality of the device are unparalleled to any other phone product on Amazon. I would not only reuse this service if needed, but would recommend to anyone that asked.",5
"Came with one charging cable, and the phone. No box or anything, but I don't need any more apple boxes on my shelves. I saved a lot of money, and would buy from these fellas and gals again..",5
"The phone I got was highly used, many dinks on the side. the front touch screen was replaced with after market junk. The touch screen stopped working after two weeks. The wifi and LTE data also slowed to a crawl. I don't recommend a used iPhone.",1
I was a little skeptical at first but once I received the phone and activated I was incredibly happy with what I bought I recommend this seller to anybody looking to buy an iPhone on amazon. 5 start quality for sure,5
"When I got my iPhone it was in new condition, but the iPhone was defective, the phone would do a blue screen loop, and then put itself into recovery mode every single night, when I went to go recover it, halfway it would fail. Thankfully the iPhone had the 1 year warranty still I'm effect, so I brought it to the apple store and got a new iPhone.",5
Phone sold as new was not had been activated 6 months early and we could not activate through apple or iTunes. Theregote I feel time snd money wasted.,1
Bought the new iphone to try it so far so good. It really isnt TOO GREAT i have been using other phones like the Xperia Z2 although Iphone 5S has some cool new features like the fingerprint scanner it isnt really something that changes the game.... It is the kind of features that u use the first time u buy the phone and then forget about,3
"Amazing phone. I woke up the next morning after using the phone, I named her Siri; and she made me coffee. I come home from work and all my clothes are folded and put away nicely. What an amazing phone the 5S is. The only problem is we can't take a shower together, something about the water Siri doesn't like. I love my 5S. <3",5
Very disapionted as I'm in Australia and the fone can't be used I understood fone locked for sprint but would axept overseas sim for use out side the states stuck with a fone that the carriers won't unlock,1
"The phone was shipped quickly, however I received the iPhone 5 instead of the 5s model that the title and description state it is. Needed a new phone as soon as possible so I didn't return the item. It works great and looked brand new. I'm just disappointed I didn't get what I thought I was paying for.",3
"Phone came in the mail dead with a scratch on the screen. Once I charged it up and tried it out, multiple letters on the keyboard did not work. To top it off, after one day of owning this ""good conditioned"" iPhone, the screen went completely bizarre. Terrible seller.",1
excellent condition and working perfect. Don't do an upgrade from your carrier to get a phone because it went bad. I'm happy with this and I'm not in another 2 yr contract with AT&T,5
This phone came in great shape. No visible scratches at all. We had no problems at all getting Sprint service added. And so far no problems and works great. So glad we bought this phone at such a great price.,5
"this phone was in great shape when I got it and was exactly as they said! I was worried about it being broken or defective, but the phone is working great and I have absolutely no problems :)",5
Shh .. This is a Christmas Gift from Santa Clause! This phone arrived before the due date & get this .. It came with EXTRAS that wasn't even mentioned or known! I was exstatic when I opened the package & saw everything so I definitely know my recipient of this gift will be too!!!,5
"This phone has been exactly what I expected and wanted. Moreover, the seller was fantastic, did a great job of transferring the phone, packing and shipping securely and promptly.",5
"My wife's iPhone 4 died and she wanted a new one, but didn't want to commit to another 2-year contract. I bought this new from Amazon for $250 less than what Sprint would charge me.",5
This is the second time I've bought an iPhone online. I wish I'd known about this company the first time around. The phone is exactly as it was described! It works and looks perfect! Would absolutely buy from them again! Thank you so much!,5
The phone is beautiful. However i only had a couple of problems with it. The top left corner is glitchy and there is a red dot on the lcd display when turned on. Other than that the phone is perfect. I would buy from this seller again.,3
"Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service.",1
Ordered three of these phones and non of them would connect to Sprint's network. Sprint told me that they were incompatible with their system. They were also not new phones and were refurbished.,1
"I love it. I never had an iPhone before and I am so glad I bought this one. It is just like new and I have seen others like this on ""sale"" for over $500.00 so I got a great deal.",5
"Shipped perfectly. Using flawlessly for months on end. Would suggest buying a SIM card with it unless you live close to a Spring store, I had to make three trips to get it working properly. However, that isn't the buyer's fault, Sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10",5
I was very excited to receive the phone in a short amount of time and to see it was basically brand new and had some charge in it so I could activate it right away! I was also very happy that it came with not 1 but 2 chargers!,5
It was great. Has worked well. but I would like to kindly request for the name that was attached to the sprint account. It is equested for the unlocking of the device. Please contact on my email ubong21@gmail.com,4
I purchased a iPhone5s and the description said it was unlocked. At&t says it is not unlocked and will not release the phone to consumer cellular. I will be returning the phone today and looking to purchase somewhere else.,1
"One of three phones I bought this month from Amazon third-party because of ""drowned"" phones. This was one was as described (or better). Shipping was very fast! Very satisfied so far!",5
"After some issues, not by the seller, the Item was as described. It's perfect! And they gave me a car charger and two phones cases for the mishap. Thank you!",5
"I'm writing this review after using the phone over a year. It was easy to hook up w sprint right out of the box, and has been working well for me since Dec 2015. I can upgrade to a new phone now but haven't because there is no need -this refurbished phone still functions without noticeable hiccups.",5
Item was ok.WARNING: IT does not come with a SIM card. Must have a SIM card from the carrier to be able to activate/ use it. Had to order a nano SIM card to make it work (still waiting on those to be delivered),2
"Appearance of the phone was perfect, unfortunately after 93 days of ownership the video blew out. There was no physical damage to the phone, it just stopped functioning and does not appear repairable.",1
"No complaints, people should read and understand what they going to buy before they start complaining, got my phone in very good condition, for the price and very honest services..",5
Overall it's a good productBut I did see some minor blemishes such as scratches also the screen was popped out in one corner but the technology was fine,3
Overall a nice little phone though the antennae seems a little week to me. I was up in the mountains near my home and my sons cheap go phone had better reception. Both phones are AT&T...,4
"Came as claimed. Near flawless condition... I couldn't find anything wrong with it if I tried. Only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum... No apple logo or and writing, at all. But it grew on me its very sleek. Phone operates as expected and is lightning fast. I would suggest to anyone.",5
The phone they sent me was manufactured for sale in Japan (or another similar country) and thus I cannot shut off the camera shutter sound. It's very annoying.,2
This phone has worked great for me for two years now. I also hate cases and have dropped it a thousand times preparing myself for the worst when I pick it up and it's still in great condition.,5
I have not even had this phone for a month and now the home button does not work!! Have not dropped it I don't know why it just stopped working from one day to the next very disappointed!! Also the screen on the side looks like it is about to pop out any minute!!,1
"Recently purchased this iPhone about 1 month or 2 months ago, sometimes it decides not to charge and then screen frezzes. its a ""NEW"" iPhone but its giving me problems..",3
It was a nice and brand new phone but it wasn't factory unlocked so I had a hard time getting it to work. I had to call 3 different companies and none could provide me with an unlock code so I had to make the decision to send this phone back and settle for a different phone that is unlocked.,2
Ordered this phone thinking it was a sprint phone.. I went to activate it on the sprint network and it isn't actually a sprint phone.. Very frustrated.,1
I really like the iphone 5S. It is my first and only smart phone so I can't judge it according to other makes. The learning curve is terrible an Apple does't tell you much about using it even starting. They assume you know the basics of smart phones apparently. Amazon Warehouse were excellent to do business with.,5
The description said never been out of the box when I got it there was NO box NO booklet NO charger. besides that I love the phone no scratches no nothing.,3
Ok I bought this iPhone now I can't activate it I am desipointed . I need this unlock now they say that there is no unlock code for this phone .pls if u are buying an iPhone make sure it is unlock this was s wast of my time and money. I am KENDAL HANNA a dissatisfied customer,1
"Brand new in sealed box, as promised. Minor complaint -- this must be from a foreign market, because the charger and brick in the box is not a US plug. Seller included a US plug in the amazon box, but its a generic charging cable and brick, not apple. Otherwise, very happy with the product.",5
This is a great phone. iPhone 5S is a great phone. Can do many things. Like multi-tasking is great. The #5 version is a stronger and very popular to work. The pictures are the most easiest for a touch phone. And much faster then the iPhone 4. Try it I think you would like it. I recently bought this for a friend of mine. And she thinks its great.,5
Great phone! I've had the 4 and the 4s and the 5s is amazing! So slim and fast and there is definitely a BIG difference in the phone compared to the 4/4s. Absolutely love apple and iOS 7. And I'm in love with the gold color!,5
"I have sold my Apple iPhone 5s 16GB, as I needed an UNBLOCKED unit, and although I thought I was bying an unblocked version, it turned out that I wasn't. I have since acquired the same machine, here in South Africa, and it is the best thing that I have ever acquired!!!!",1
"Didn't realize how small the screen was...much smaller than my LG which got damaged. I don't like the sound on this. I am unable to put my vm's on speaker so can barely hear my messages, even with the volume at max. The one thing I do like is it since with all my other Apple devices.",3
I should've upgraded ages ago but was too cheap. So glad I can finally get rid of my 4s and be up to speed with the rest of the world! The 5s is so much faster and more responsive. The cable that came with my phone stopped working after just a couple weeks but I replaced it with an Amazon cable and we are good to go.,5
I absolutely love this phone. Being an 17 year old I had worried about buying an iPhone on Amazon for such a low price of 199$ but this phone is absolutely amazing and I totally recommend you buying this phone! It came earlier than expected and came with a charger.,5
"Good phone performs like it should.but calls have static sometimes but it goes away but phone was in awesome condition , very happy I would recommend. Fast shipping too I needed the phone.",5
phone did not work properly. we had to take it to ATT store. the #1 button would not work on keyboard. they had to replace the glass $110. now it works fine. pretty disappointing. It was shipped to my daughter in college and there was no time to send it back and get another one.,1
"Arrived on time, quick shipment! The phone arrived in its original box & factory sealed by Apple. Received my order in less than 24 hours. Plus I got it for a great price! Highly recommended!",5
I am sorry I never wrote a review for you when you I purchased this. Phone was exactly as described and works great. We some issues getting it set up because it was still on the buyers apple account. The buyer worked fast on getting it removed and we were able to add to our provider within two days. Thank You!,5
"It's really good! But sometimes, it doesn't find good signal! I don't know why... If it's the cellphone, or if it's the carrier! The product is amazing, what I had found",4
We are very satisfied with our purchase. The dealer answered questions promptly and communicated with professionalism. would definitely recommend people purchase from this site and this dealer. will be purchasing again soon. Product exceeded my expectations. very satisfied.,5
currently very very pleased with this phone!! i bought it refurbished and it is like brand new. i have had no problems so far and hope i don't have to encounter any.,5
My son does not get the best of signal when at home or in small town areas. But overall he seems to enjoy this phone and has no other complaint. Package came as promised and delivered late due to a mix up but was refunded the shipment before phone arrived. Overall very satisfied,4
"This item came very fast. I was disappointed when they told me it will arrive in a week, but so happy and overwhelmed when it arrived in two days without PRIME connection. The iPhone works perfectly and don't regret purchasing. Best thing I've bought!",5
"The score I am hit to customer service, a staff name Racquel,I buy this phone in a month ago, because of some reasons lead to the phone I haven't use!Finally I reflect the problem to think name is Racquel staff, he is very careful, and have the patience to help me to solve this problem!",5
this phone has disabled me more times than i can say in the short time i have had it. if i could return this phone i would..very unhappy w this phone...,2
"Phone works fine, but went through the run around to get a SIM card. NO...the phone doesn't come with one. Luckily, I was able to get one from Apple because Sprint doesn't have them to give to customers.",3
"Phone was still owned by previous owner and his/her name wasn't clear from at&t, therefore have trouble activating the phone.Update: Resolve when speak with at&t representative, showing them the receipt that I purchase this phone.",1
Terrible! It is a Sprint phone and they couldn't turn it on. I tried to return it but never heard back from the seller. Then I tried to unlock it and have T-Mobile turn it on. They couldn't do it either. This was a waste of my money!!!!,1
Works and arrived as advertised. I feel the the motherboard was scrapped from a 4s because it shows up on AT&T and iTunes as a 4s. I crossed-checked the serial number through Apple and it says it is a 5s so the controlling component must have been from a 4s. Other than that I'm happy with the purchase.,4
"I got it for my out-of-town daughter, so aside from doing the initial setup, I really don't know how it's working out for her. But my brief experience with it was just fine.",5
"love the phone but not the battery. the battery was so damaged and abused that i had to go get it replaced. also, they sent me a nasty otterbox that was beyond the point of no return with how dirty it was.",3
"One star, only because I can't give it ZERO. The phone is a Japanese model, which is fine if you have to conform to Japanese laws. I'm not Japanese nor do I live in Japan. Right away I noticed several features I was unable to turn off because of the model of the phone. Entirely unhappy with this purchase.",1
"I bought an used - like new one. There are little scratch, but I like it very much. I used it for some days, there was not any problem. But the battery cyclecounts are 292 times, very high rate. So 3 stars.",3
"The phone was nice, but the used model sent came with a broken proximity sensor and the home button was a little funky. We returned it and went through Verizon for a brand new phone instead.",3
The shipping was on time. It said it would be here Friday by 8pm I got it Friday at 10am. Took the phone to Verizon to activate it and it works! Very pleased and very pleased with the price I paid for a good phone!,5
"So far so great! I was a little hesitate buying a refurbished phone, but I have had zero issues! It runs great, hardly any scratches or scuffs and the 64GB of storage is amazing compared to the 8GB of storage I had on my iPhone 4S. Really glad I found this awesome deal on Black Friday!",5
"I haven't had a lick of trouble when I got this phone. Not one. It works great, came with everything I needed it to come with, is just what I wanted. Great quality.",5
I'm not sure how I bought this phone for $350 with 64 gigabytes of internal memory but I did ........and it works perfectly on Verizon Wireless.....can't beat it........ came in great condition.....WIFE loves it.,5
"I was told that this iPhone would work with the Verizon network, but it is for AT&T instead. Otherwise I would love it because the seller was really accommodating and the price was great.",4
"Had it for 4 months now and no issues thankfully. I'm giving 5 stars because it's exactly what it described it as. Some normal wear & tear, but it works well and hasn't let me down yet.",5
"I was expecting to get a phone with a few scratches, but the phone was like new. There were no problems getting it set up and it's working perfectly. I purchased the phone for my son and he's very happy with it.",5
"The quality of the product was actually better than I expected, and the delivery also arrived earlier than the projected date which was a plus for me.",5
"The charger, headphone and cable are not original manufacturing. When I try the lightening cable. The handset display ""May not support"". Of course you can avoid that by another side of connector. I think it's good purchasing experience for me. But amazon should improve the quality of peripherals.",4
Very pleased with purchase. The details of the phone noted minor scratches. When I received the phone it looked brand new. It came with new accessories. Highly recommended.,5
"The phone came looking fine, but sometimes the screen glitches and isn't coordinated with where I tap, and sometimes just plain old wigs out and does random things when I'm not even touching the screen. But I can't afford the time to not have a phone so I'm just gonna deal with it for now.",3
"very happy with purchase. phone was in very good shape, very little wear apparent. screen and case looked close to perfect. works just as new and NO trouble getting it on my verizon account (no charge). came exactly as described and on time. Id buy from them again.",5
"as advertised. complete with charger and earbuds (earbuds are no as good as the Originals, but it is nice to have them included) Would purchase from seller again",5
"The online thing was that it did not come with the verizon Sim card like the description leads you to believe. Overall- VERY fast shipping! Phone is brand new as expected, now just to wait for the SIM card so I can enjoy it!",5
"iPhone's battery does not work properly! This was not included in the description. The battery died every 20 minutes unless it was connected to a charger. Once the phone would turn back on, it would say that the battery life was at 30%!",1
"The charging cord it came with sucks. It fried after a week of barely using it so that's really poor quality. Also, the phones volume button is jammed and I barely even use it. I use my earphones to adjust the volume. I wouldn't buy it again. I got it new and it's really causing me problems already.",2
"Received my iphone 5s, bought from thegizmogadgets.. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and looks absolutely new, no visible scratch seen, although the battery is a bit used already but it still fine..",5
I got this product at the end of September and it worked for about 3 weeks until one day lines appeared on the screen and it is now defective. I would not recommend buying this product unless you want a broken iphone.,1
"Phone arrived sooner than expected. Very clean, no signs of use. So far is working just fine. I use it for Page Plus Cellular and I was able to transfer my old number to this new phone without any problems. Great Phone.",5
"This has been a good purchase. The battery life isn't as good as we hoped. Sometimes it dies with 20% left to go. But for the price we got it, I didn't really expect it to be perfect. Other than that, there have been no problems.",4
"The phone overall works fine, but I Just didn't like that it came with headphones and not a charger. The screen was really dirty when I opened the box too. I just say never take a picture of stuff that isn't going to be included. False advertising!!",3
"This phone was a promised by the seller. I actually thought I had an issue with the phone and the seller went over the top to help me. The most amazing seller I have ever dealt with. As far as the phone, my daughter LOVES it!",5
"I got this in the mail and it came with a little kit to clean the screen and then a REALLY nice screen protector. It was a nice little surprise. Anyways, I put a phone case on and it looks brand new! It also works great.",5
Phone is great! Everything is like it said in the description. Had to go to the I phone store for help setting up but that was a minor delay and it worked shortly after. The 30 day warranty was very re-assuring however I won't be returning this phone. Very happy thanks,5
"This phone is garbage. I've had it for less than three months and it's always having problems. Constantly freezing, kicking me out of apps, and dying way above 0% (yesterday it was at 43% when it decided to die).I had such high hopes for this seller and was very disappointed.",1
Thrilled to have this iPhone! Still learning how to use it with ALL the features. Don't know what your missing until you have it in your hot little hand. Wonderful machine.,5
Every function on the phone works well however Bluetooth and wireless are broken. Tried several reboots with the software so it must be a hardware issue. Very disappointing. Not worth the $300+ I paid for it.,2
"Phone worked great for like two weeks. Turns out it wasn't brand new at all, screen started ghost clicking and when I took it to the apple store to use the ""warranty"" it comes with they said it wasn't even new and the warranty wouldn't cover it.",1
"I do not know if these reviews are seller specific but I order the phone from ""Next Level Mobile"" which was labeled as ""new"" after around 3.5 months the display was not working, when I brought it to Apple they said they could not fix the problem because it has been replaced with a ""third party display"".",1
I had ran into a problem with my phone just a week after i had it. i took it to the apple store and they said they couldn't do anything to it because it wasn't an Apple product. It was one of those fake phones from China. now i have to invest in another phone.,1
"Very pleased. I love it. I was expecting more scratches because of shipping but only one or two on back. A small dent on the top of the phone but not noticable in the picture. I would recommend getting this phone, you will not regret it!",5
"Well unfortunately my my phone went swimming and I was forced to decide between buying a new phone for $600 or buy a used one. I got an iPhone 5s in mint condition for less than $200 shipped to my door step in just a few days. Very pleased, would highly recommend this phone and for anybody facing the same situation as me",5
Phone came in mail pretty reasonably but the phone won't turn on or take a charge...seller obviously didn't check to make sure it worked before sending it out. They are based out of Brooklyn so I'm sure they are a lot of shady stores there.,1
This cell phone was easy to start up with Verizon. I bought this phone for my daughter who lives out of state so our family could stay connected. My daughter loves this phone.,5
"Bought this phone for my teenager after getting tired of spending ridiculous amounts of money on the ""latest and greatest"". I have had no regrets. The iPhone has worked great and saved me hundreds of dollars over the price of the latest iPhone.",5
"I bought this to replace my iPhone 6 that got stolen a few weeks ago. I couldn't afford to purchase another 6 so I decided the 5S would suffice. I received the phone today and so far, I am very happy with my purchase. It looks like it has never been used and it works perfectly. It arrived much earlier than expected as well so that is a plus!",5
What can I say? The phone was FAKE. I took it to Verizon & they tried & tried. We were there for hours. End result- it's NOT A REAL IPHONE. This was my 12 year olds birthday gift.. Shame on these people.,1
"Upgrade for my wife from tracfone, took it to Verizon Corporate store for setup, ready to go in 15 minutes. Ported her old # over. Screen is too small for me (my iPhone 6s is easier for me to see) . Bought this refurbished from Noble Planet after looking at their history. I'm very happy with Noble Planet and with this phone.",4
"I was hesitant about buying this phone online, but it came better than expected. Clean with no scratches and works great. I inserted my SIM card and was using it instantly.",5
"The I-phone met all my expectations related to appearance, however the battery is weak and does not hold charge very well, and I am a very light user, it will need a new battery soon which is an extra $50 !",4
"Mobile phone appearance at a line still, there is a slight scratches, can accept, but found that the battery is charging when use more than 300 times, for it is not satisfied",2
"Said the phone was in 'Good' condition. There was one tiny pinprick of a scratch on the back, but other than that it is flawless. This company is good. It was also simple to activate.",5
I bought a refurbished phone and it came in on time. Works very well and since its a refurbished phone then there is still some very light scratched on the side but it doesn't bother me. Overall good buy. Nice camera quality!,5
"It's good, but not as like new as described in condition like new.I think described as very good condition is more reasonable because there are some black points in the back of the cellphone and little scratch in the side.Whatever I'm satisfied with the shopping with the price to get this phone.",3
"Purchased as ""used"" but it arrived in like-new condition complete with charger, cable, and ear buds. Been using the phone for several days now and it works exactly as expected. Out of the box, I had to charge it, then took it to the Verizon store where they verified the ESN was clean, and then installed a verizon sim card. No complaints at all.",5
"This is the first phone I've bought on Amazon. I was kind of leery but the phone came within 2 days, with an estimated 5 to 7 business day shipping expectation. The phone was Verizon ready, no scratches, chips, or any kind of damage on the phone. I love it. And would definitely recommend it.",5
Had an issue with finger print controls. Customer service outstanding they sent me another phone fast fast fast. Perfect phone. Love the newer features over iphone4,5
This does NOT work on Verizon!!!! Very disappointed and sent back immediately after taking to the Verizon store and being told it couldn't be activated.,1
"My husband got me this iPhone 5s for my birthday. I absolutely love it. The reason I'm only giving it 4/5 stars is because the charger port was just FILLED with lint and junk, affecting its ability to charge. My husband had to dig all the lint out with a safety pin.",4
"I'm super happy with my new phone, it works up to every standard and is fast. When I got the phone I noticed that there is very small wear and tear. Only one or two scratches on the screen but overall I couldn't have asked for a much better phone with this much space for this cheap",5
Apple IPhone 5S is working perfectly. No problem getting phone connected thru Verizon service and their free SIMM Card. Very happy with Amazon timely service also.Thank you.,4
"Awesome phone. Works perfect, great price point for brand new phone! Couldn't be happier. Customer service was world class. Will definitely buy here again.",5
"Great form finish, metal and glass feel phenomenal. Cases don't add too much bulk due to already minimal dimensions. Fantastic phone& reliable operating system. Would definitely recommend even in 2016.",5
"Though the phone barely has any scratches or mishandling marks, the iPhone I received has a bad case of ghost tapping. Minus this annoying factor, the iPhone runs smoothly and the battery last as long as any other iPhone.",3
"The operating system failed within 4 months, beyond repair. The warranty with the seller was just 30 days. Very unfriendly return/exchange policy for an expensive item one expects to last at least a couple of years. SELLER/PRODUCT NOT RECOMMENDED.",1
"Although the phone itself was good, it turns out to be a non-verizon machine. which doesn't work with verizon simcard. I think they didn't test it. before selling.",1
"Excellent phone, in flawless condition. Not one single problem and got my phone a few day's earlier than expected... Highly recommend cellcow to all....",5
"So much faster than my iPhone 4s.Everything came in the box... iPhone, charging cable and plug, Verizon sim card, earplugs. I took it to Verizon to switch over to my new iPhone 5s but the rep in the store told me that I could have done the setup at home. :)",5
"Bought this from Best Price Phones or kugs8989, in February - listed as NEW. Today, June 6, the battery is dead and will not hold a charge. Seller has disappeared. I've had the same model of phone since it was first issued in 2013, and it is still going strong.",1
"The screen had a couple of glitches with brightness initially, but it seems to have resolved and is working well. I would purchase a new phone with this seller again.",4
Major cons: (not negotiable)- speaker phone function is roughly 50% of how loud it needs to be. Makes listening to music or talking to people using the speaker pointless without headphones- Bluetooth function will not even display other devices to link to. Completely inoperable Bluetooth capabilityPros:-clean screen with little scratches or dings,1
"Received my new Iphone 5s today and looks used. I bought as new and paid new price for the phone. Box was beaten up, had been opened and re taped. Charged the phone and it had already been setup. Will see how it works but not very happy",3
"I was disappointed when I received the phone and found out that it is not usable on Verizon, even though it clearly stated in the description that it is a Verizon cell phone.",1
"Phone is OK, but when I use the earbuds with mic, the mic does not work. I notified the company and was sent two new sets of earbuds. One of the sets does not have sound from the left side. Still cannot use the mic with this phone. Disappointed.",3
"I was hesitant about buying this phone online, but it came better than expected. Clean with no scratches and works great. I inserted my SIM card and was using it instantly.",5
"I got it for my out-of-town daughter, so aside from doing the initial setup, I really don't know how it's working out for her. But my brief experience with it was just fine.",5
"love the phone but not the battery. the battery was so damaged and abused that i had to go get it replaced. also, they sent me a nasty otterbox that was beyond the point of no return with how dirty it was.",3
"Had an iPhone5, went to a Galaxy S5 (hated it), went back to iPhone (5S this time). Performance is noticeably better than the iPhone5 and SO much better than my S5 (especially after the Lollipop update). Battery life much better than S5, too. Love it!",5
"I'm still using this iphone now after purchasing it months ago, but the fingerprint unlocking mechanism stopped working less than a month in. It's a fine phone but I wish that aspect of it hadn't quit so soon.",4
"Be sure to check out to confirm the phone is fully working within the 30 days. If not, no refund or credit. We purchased a phone and it completely died within (6) months. Should have just bought it through my cell company. I feel for the price I paid, it should work a lot longer.",2
What can I say? The phone was FAKE. I took it to Verizon & they tried & tried. We were there for hours. End result- it's NOT A REAL IPHONE. This was my 12 year olds birthday gift.. Shame on these people.,1
This product came in earlier than expected. As said in the description this phone did have evidence of usage but if you wear a case on it then you can't see the damage and it looks brand new with a case of it. I love it so much. I would recommend buying this.,5
"Everything was as described, very little wear overall (phone was a little dirty but it cleaned up like new with a little rubbing alcohol). It arrived on time, activation went smoothly and the phone is in great working order. 10/10 would order again.",5
"this is my first smartphone,,s0,,, it will take some time to learn how to use,,battery goes dead in 24 hours with very limited use---that sucks---phone was as listed,, looks good,, works good, i guess",5
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It isn't a new phone. It is jailbroken into and then re-packaged to look new. I spent over 6 hours trying to get this phone to work with verizon only to find out it actually isn't brand new and was actually messed with. Don't buy!!,1
I bought this that the intention that it was new and never used. When i went and brought the phone to the verizon wireless and the phone was definitely already used and registered to another person and i had a problem transferring the phone to my plan.,2
"When I got it, I was expecting some glitches. The first time I plugged it in, it decided to scream beeping noises at me that it couldn't keep up the connection. It has gotten better since then. I just it just needed to be loved again to get better.I still feel like I paid too much.",3
"I'll give em a thumbs up. As I will say,they went above & beyond to resolve the error of receiving an incorrect item by error. Impressed with the customer service response & pleased with the product once received.",4
"The phone came looking fine, but sometimes the screen glitches and isn't coordinated with where I tap, and sometimes just plain old wigs out and does random things when I'm not even touching the screen. But I can't afford the time to not have a phone so I'm just gonna deal with it for now.",3
"The phone is in fact new and it arrived pretty quickly. I really recommend it. A note was sent along with my phone, I would most definitely buy from them again.",5
"I received the phone. The screen was loose. The digitizer was non- responsive. It looked like it was put together in a backyard shack, by a bunch of blind elves. Simply put. It's junk.",1
"They may say its a new screen, but its replaced with a third party aftermarket screen that is not OEM.Apple refuses to service any iphone that has an aftemarket screen.",1
The phone arrived in pristine condition to replace an iPhone 4 my daughter had soaked. It just needed the replacement sim card. I have one and love it for all the features and compact size--easy to slip in a pocket and yet very readable.,5
"My iPhone arrived sealed in the box. Everything was perfect! I needed mine for Verizon Wireless, so I can't say if it was unlocked or not. The phone had all the accessories it was supposed to come with and everything works well. I am pleased!",5
"The phone turned out to be a Verizon phone, and was not ""unlocked"" to be used on other networks.This was definitely false advertizing and currently struggling to return it for full refund...do to traveling.",1
"I've had the top of the line Android phones and every single iphone ever and the iphone is the best phone there is and at this rate ever will be...whether it be because of design or performance, it's the better phone.",5
This is my 3rd refurbished iPhone from Amazon and I'm very happy. Works great. You can't beat the price and they always guarantee that they work well.,5
"Went to Verizon Corp store, put the sim card in, turned it on and was up and running in minutes. Completed OS upgrade in 20 minutes, restored iCloud data and was good to go.",4
It came quickly and the phone looks like its brand new. My only issue is that it does some weird things whenI try to use it while its charging. Other than that it works perfectly!,4
"My husband got me this iPhone 5s for my birthday. I absolutely love it. The reason I'm only giving it 4/5 stars is because the charger port was just FILLED with lint and junk, affecting its ability to charge. My husband had to dig all the lint out with a safety pin.",4
"I'm super happy with my new phone, it works up to every standard and is fast. When I got the phone I noticed that there is very small wear and tear. Only one or two scratches on the screen but overall I couldn't have asked for a much better phone with this much space for this cheap",5
I am super happy with this vendor. The Iphone came in super fast before it was suposeto and it was almost brand new and it works. It was the best purchase I've made. My son is super happy! Thanks,5
"Probably could've found better prices , also the battery drains fast a few weeks after I bought it, recenty just shut down for no reason when it was at 70% .",3
"This phone is okay. My son purchased it, he didn't realize how little storage there is. He is constantly deleting nearly all apps and photos to make the phone operable.",3
"Phone was in perfect condition when I got it, everything was fine, until I put the SIM in. Phone was blocked on my network and was reported as stolen. Needless to say, I am NOT happy with this outcome.",1
Great item! Received it a day earlier than expected but works great! Good condition except for stickers on back! Other than that great deal! I reccomend!,5
The phone goes on and off on its own. It also says that the battery is charged and goes dead anytime. I will never purchase a phone from this person ever again. I brought for my daughter cannot call me at times because phone goes dead on its own and with battery says it on 64%.😡,1
"Good phone and in good condition, but recently discovered that this is only an Iphone 5, not a 5s. Also, it didn't come with the stock earbuds, which are expensive. FALSE ADVERTISING.",2
This was advertised as new. Took it to Apple as the battery was depleted after 2 months. They refused to work on it because the battery was third party as were many of the buttons and inner working!! This was not as advertised at all.,1
"This person is a scam artist. I bought my phone, everything works great for a while, then it is reported that the payments are not being made on it and the IMIE is blocked. This person knows exactly what they are doing and they are criminals.",1
it crazy if you lunch an app it takes you outcant hear people without headphones and for them you sound farand cant take phonescalls sometimes it impossible would not recomended,1
This was supposed to be new! It's two years old! I was mislead into believing I was buying a new iPhone. Now it's messing up and I went to Apple Store and they told me its two years old and warranty is up! I got ripped of!!!!!!!!!!,1
I bought this for a friend.1. The product arrived very quickly. It didn't take the amount of time that amazon said it would so that's always a plus.2. Minimal damage to the phone. It worked like a charm3. It's STILL working. lol. My friend is horrible with phones and yet he's managed to keep this one in tact.,5
"the back camera stopped working, the phone touch screen stops working and i have to restart the phone to get it to work. The phone is a huge disappointment. Not worth what i paid for it.",1
"Phone was fine at first, but after two weeks it was constantly shutting down. The power button got stuck down. Took the phone to Apple and they said it was toast. I was able to return this phone through Amazon though for a full refund and ended up just buying a new I-Phone 6 from my wireless provider.",1
"Though fully packaged, it is not totally new.Checking on the Apple support (the Apple web), it says this phone's Telephone Technical Support has already EXPIRED, and only 1 months to Repairs and Service Coverage Expiration Date. Which means it registered about 1 years ago.",2
"Came on time, but a little skeptical about whether or not it was actually new.Other than that the product works great and I'm using it to type this review right now!",5
"Scam, the phone was barred off the network after 1 week due to ""Unpaid payments in the T-Mobile payment plan"", returned immediately to amazon. I'm very disappointed.",1
Came on time but the charger did not work and did not come with headphones or any manuals. It also did not come with the little key to open the sim slot,3
"Im loving it....So far it works very good no problems, no damages, scratches or anything. Came on time arrived by the 20th which was a couple days ago. It's all what was described about the iPhone 5s and to say im glad i bought it.",5
"As of November 2015 this phones memory is just about full. 16 GB is simply NOT enough space....and I'm not a big ""apps"" person, but I do like to save my pictures. Otherwise I have no complaints.",4
"I just received this ""unlocked"" iphone 5s two days ago and was happy until I but I tried to put my sim card in. No service so I called my carrier T-Mobile and oh guess what the phone has a carrier lock on it with guess who T-Mobile. Needless to say I'm pissed and without a phone or money and have yet to get a reply or a refund. ZERO STARS!!!",1
Serious problems with the phone. Isnt compatible with tmobile but says in the factory settings that the carrier is tmobile. Also isn't unlocked like they claim to be. Don't buy the phone it's just a huge hassle,1
Phone arrived quickly as described and worked great for a week. After a day bouncing between Apple and my carrier Apple replaced the phone for a new one. The new phone lasted a week and I had to make another appointment with Apple and they replaced that phone. Quality control could be better. Has all the bells and whistle to keep my daughter happy.,4
"This phone sucks!!😒 Do not waste your money on this product. The first day I got it, it was powering off by itself many times. It always froze. I bought it 4 months ago and now it does not work at all!!! The screen popped out all the time. Even tho it says new it is definitely used! Worst phone I probably ever had !",1
I enjoy the fingerprint addition so when people are nearby I can just touch the home button to unlock my phone without anyone lurking to see me enter my unlock code.,5
Great phone works well with T-Mobile. Game new out-of-the-box in perfect mint condition. It's the right size phone for me I had a Samsung galaxy S3 before that wouldn't fit in my pocket. This phone is lightning fastsyncs with my iTunes automatically can't say enough good things about it. Seller shipped fast no issues,5
I love this phone! I cut my original Sim card that was in my Samsung Galaxy and put it in the new Iphone 5s and it works great.Internet responds super fast and the fingerprint unlock is amazing. Condition is perfect and it came in the original box. I'm very happy with my purchase.,5
A very good device. My only problem is its size. It is heavy in a shirt pocket and inconvenient in hip pocket of a trouser. It slips out very easily from a pocket. I have lost it already 3 times in the last six months but fortunately each time I could find it.,4
Just got my iPhone in the mail thisy 3rd day using it and everything I just like a brand new iPhone 5s no regrets here for the price I got it...... so far.,5
This seller is amazing! I asked about a million questions and they were More than happy to respond to them. When I got the phone I cut my SIM card down to size and it responded immediately! Phone is basically perfect!!,5
"Had to return the phone. After 10 days of the phone, phone became blocked and could not be used. The phone came out of service and couldn't not be used to call or text.",1
"I read a couple of bad reviews, but my experience its been great. I got a brand new IPhone, in a sealed box with all the accessories and works perfectly fine.",5
I am super happy with this vendor. The Iphone came in super fast before it was suposeto and it was almost brand new and it works. It was the best purchase I've made. My son is super happy! Thanks,5
"Don't waste your money on this phone. I bought this phone a month ago and I kept getting this blue screen, then it reboots itself over and over again. Doesn't work well with T-Mobile like it said, I tried sending it back but they won't take it back. One month into my iPhone and I'm now looking to buy another phone.",1
Real iphone 5s. Came in factory box sealed up like an apple store would sell it to you. It has some better features than the 4 and is ALOT faster! I like it! I sanded down my old sim card for my 4 and it fit in my 5 (save $10-20 on a sim card at tmobile),5
"Good phone and in good condition, but recently discovered that this is only an Iphone 5, not a 5s. Also, it didn't come with the stock earbuds, which are expensive. FALSE ADVERTISING.",2

Amazing quality. I knew what i was receiving because i already owned an iphone 5S. Unexpected fast delivery. Definitely will buy again ( if i break this one..haha),5
"Perfect perfect perfect! My phone came right on time. I got it and it was like new just as he said. He also sent a charger and a cute pink otter box which was great, because I didn't have to go out and buy one. Thanks!!",5
"i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs though. They are involved with Dr Dre now and I heard they are going to make bigger phones, something Steve Jobs was against. Guess we will see.",5
This person selling this item is a liar .. I asked specifically if this unit is for t mobile. The sell told me yes.. I put a tmobile SIM card in this phone that was sent to me but it did not read because the Carrier was sent to sprint,1
I bought this for a friend.1. The product arrived very quickly. It didn't take the amount of time that amazon said it would so that's always a plus.2. Minimal damage to the phone.

Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,1
"Probably could've found better prices , also the battery drains fast a few weeks after I bought it, recenty just shut down for no reason when it was at 70% .",3

"It all came in a sealed box, the phone was new and works great. My only problem was that the part that connects to the wall to charge doesn't work too well so I had to use a different connector.",5

Thrilled to have this iPhone! Still learning how to use it with ALL the features. Don't know what your missing until you have it in your hot little hand. Wonderful machine.,5
"I was told that this iPhone would work with the Verizon network, but it is for AT&T instead. Otherwise I would love it because the seller was really accommodating and the price was great.",4
"Had it for 4 months now and no issues thankfully. I'm giving 5 stars because it's exactly what it described it as. Some normal wear & tear, but it works well and hasn't let me down yet.",5
"I was expecting to get a phone with a few scratches, but the phone was like new. There were no problems getting it set up and it's working perfectly. I purchased the phone for my son and he's very happy with it.",5
"Phone was in fair condition. The case had more scratches than originally suggested. For the price, however, a great purchase and delivered very quickly.",3
I'm real happy with my iPhone 5S it works great has a lot of features on it and I just upgraded me to a better phone I love the tracking system that Amazon offers you know exactly when you're going to receive it,5
"Excellent phone, in flawless condition. Not one single problem and got my phone a few day's earlier than expected... Highly recommend cellcow to all....",5
"So much faster than my iPhone 4s.Everything came in the box... iPhone, charging cable and plug, Verizon sim card, earplugs. I took it to Verizon to switch over to my new iPhone 5s but the rep in the store told me that I could have done the setup at home. :)",5
Screen started going out shortly after activating the phone. Took it to the apple store to hear that it needs a whole new screen. It is now fully understood why the phone was put up for sale to begin with.,1
"The I-phone met all my expectations related to appearance, however the battery is weak and does not hold charge very well, and I am a very light user, it will need a new battery soon which is an extra $50 !",4
"Mobile phone appearance at a line still, there is a slight scratches, can accept, but found that the battery is charging when use more than 300 times, for it is not satisfied",2
"Said the phone was in 'Good' condition. There was one tiny pinprick of a scratch on the back, but other than that it is flawless. This company is good. It was also simple to activate.",5
What can I say! I amSuper pleased . Arrived befor time set on amazon. Seller kept in touch w mePersonally To tell me about items I bought. Explained what I Was goingTo receive Very clear and was very helpful! Christmas presents for my kids they are very happy . THANK YOU!,5
"It's good, but not as like new as described in condition like new.I think described as very good condition is more reasonable because there are some black points in the back of the cellphone and little scratch in the side.Whatever I'm satisfied with the shopping with the price to get this phone.",3
"I was hesitant about buying this phone online, but it came better than expected. Clean with no scratches and works great. I inserted my SIM card and was using it instantly.",5
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It isn't a new phone. It is jailbroken into and then re-packaged to look new. I spent over 6 hours trying to get this phone to work with verizon only to find out it actually isn't brand new and was actually messed with. Don't buy!!,1
I bought this that the intention that it was new and never used. When i went and brought the phone to the verizon wireless and the phone was definitely already used and registered to another person and i had a problem transferring the phone to my plan.,2
"I bought an used - like new one. There are little scratch, but I like it very much. I used it for some days, there was not any problem. But the battery cyclecounts are 292 times, very high rate. So 3 stars.",3
"The phone was nice, but the used model sent came with a broken proximity sensor and the home button was a little funky. We returned it and went through Verizon for a brand new phone instead.",3
The shipping was on time. It said it would be here Friday by 8pm I got it Friday at 10am. Took the phone to Verizon to activate it and it works! Very pleased and very pleased with the price I paid for a good phone!,5
"Very pleased. I love it. I was expecting more scratches because of shipping but only one or two on back. A small dent on the top of the phone but not noticable in the picture. I would recommend getting this phone, you will not regret it!",5
"Well unfortunately my my phone went swimming and I was forced to decide between buying a new phone for $600 or buy a used one. I got an iPhone 5s in mint condition for less than $200 shipped to my door step in just a few days. Very pleased, would highly recommend this phone and for anybody facing the same situation as me",5
Phone came in mail pretty reasonably but the phone won't turn on or take a charge...seller obviously didn't check to make sure it worked before sending it out. They are based out of Brooklyn so I'm sure they are a lot of shady stores there.,1
This cell phone was easy to start up with Verizon. I bought this phone for my daughter who lives out of state so our family could stay connected. My daughter loves this phone.,5
"Bought this phone for my teenager after getting tired of spending ridiculous amounts of money on the ""latest and greatest"". I have had no regrets. The iPhone has worked great and saved me hundreds of dollars over the price of the latest iPhone.",5
"Haven't activated this phone yet, as it is a Christmas gift, but the phone is in great condition (as described). So far, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Will update this review, if it is necessary.Update: We absolutely love this phone and I am very satisfied with the purchase.",5
I bought this phone and then receive a iPhone 5! Not a 5s. Just a 5. I get it. The battery percentage is wrong so my phone shuts off at 35%. My touch screen lags and fidgets all the time. And my microphone hardly works. This company is terrible! Don't ever buy from them!!!,1
"I received the phone. The screen was loose. The digitizer was non- responsive. It looked like it was put together in a backyard shack, by a bunch of blind elves. Simply put. It's junk.",1
"They may say its a new screen, but its replaced with a third party aftermarket screen that is not OEM.Apple refuses to service any iphone that has an aftemarket screen.",1
The phone arrived in pristine condition to replace an iPhone 4 my daughter had soaked. It just needed the replacement sim card. I have one and love it for all the features and compact size--easy to slip in a pocket and yet very readable.,5
I got this product at the end of September and it worked for about 3 weeks until one day lines appeared on the screen and it is now defective. I would not recommend buying this product unless you want a broken iphone.,1
"Phone arrived sooner than expected. Very clean, no signs of use. So far is working just fine. I use it for Page Plus Cellular and I was able to transfer my old number to this new phone without any problems. Great Phone.",5
"This has been a good purchase. The battery life isn't as good as we hoped. Sometimes it dies with 20% left to go. But for the price we got it, I didn't really expect it to be perfect. Other than that, there have been no problems.",4
"I haven't had a lick of trouble when I got this phone. Not one. It works great, came with everything I needed it to come with, is just what I wanted. Great quality.",5
I'm not sure how I bought this phone for $350 with 64 gigabytes of internal memory but I did ........and it works perfectly on Verizon Wireless.....can't beat it........ came in great condition.....WIFE loves it.,5
"So far so great! I was a little hesitate buying a refurbished phone, but I have had zero issues! It runs great, hardly any scratches or scuffs and the 64GB of storage is amazing compared to the 8GB of storage I had on my iPhone 4S. Really glad I found this awesome deal on Black Friday!",5
"Purchased as ""used"" but it arrived in like-new condition complete with charger, cable, and ear buds. Been using the phone for several days now and it works exactly as expected. Out of the box, I had to charge it, then took it to the Verizon store where they verified the ESN was clean, and then installed a verizon sim card. No complaints at all.",5
"This is the first phone I've bought on Amazon. I was kind of leery but the phone came within 2 days, with an estimated 5 to 7 business day shipping expectation. The phone was Verizon ready, no scratches, chips, or any kind of damage on the phone. I love it. And would definitely recommend it.",5
Had an issue with finger print controls. Customer service outstanding they sent me another phone fast fast fast. Perfect phone. Love the newer features over iphone4,5
This does NOT work on Verizon!!!! Very disappointed and sent back immediately after taking to the Verizon store and being told it couldn't be activated.,1
"Received my new Iphone 5s today and looks used. I bought as new and paid new price for the phone. Box was beaten up, had been opened and re taped. Charged the phone and it had already been setup. Will see how it works but not very happy",3
"When I got it, I was expecting some glitches. The first time I plugged it in, it decided to scream beeping noises at me that it couldn't keep up the connection. It has gotten better since then. I just it just needed to be loved again to get better.I still feel like I paid too much.",3
"Phone was advertised as new, but was defective. Took it to the apple store and they said it came up on their computer as recycled. HMMMM Am having to return it.",1
This is my 3rd refurbished iPhone from Amazon and I'm very happy. Works great. You can't beat the price and they always guarantee that they work well.,5
"I'm still using this iphone now after purchasing it months ago, but the fingerprint unlocking mechanism stopped working less than a month in. It's a fine phone but I wish that aspect of it hadn't quit so soon.",4
"Be sure to check out to confirm the phone is fully working within the 30 days. If not, no refund or credit. We purchased a phone and it completely died within (6) months. Should have just bought it through my cell company. I feel for the price I paid, it should work a lot longer.",2
I bought a refurbished phone and it came in on time. Works very well and since its a refurbished phone then there is still some very light scratched on the side but it doesn't bother me. Overall good buy. Nice camera quality!,5
"Went to Verizon Corp store, put the sim card in, turned it on and was up and running in minutes. Completed OS upgrade in 20 minutes, restored iCloud data and was good to go.",4
"The phone is in fact new and it arrived pretty quickly. I really recommend it. A note was sent along with my phone, I would most definitely buy from them again.",5
"I was very nervous about buying an expensive item from Amazon, but I gave it a try and DO NOT regret it! I got my package in record time and it was exactly, if not better, than what I was hoping.",5
"I needed to upgrade my iPhone 4, and wasn't sure what to go with. Turns out I found a decent price in comparison, and it's everything I wanted and more. Love iPhone!",5
"The online thing was that it did not come with the verizon Sim card like the description leads you to believe. Overall- VERY fast shipping! Phone is brand new as expected, now just to wait for the SIM card so I can enjoy it!",5
"iPhone's battery does not work properly! This was not included in the description. The battery died every 20 minutes unless it was connected to a charger. Once the phone would turn back on, it would say that the battery life was at 30%!",1
"I got this in the mail and it came with a little kit to clean the screen and then a REALLY nice screen protector. It was a nice little surprise. Anyways, I put a phone case on and it looks brand new! It also works great.",5
Phone is great! Everything is like it said in the description. Had to go to the I phone store for help setting up but that was a minor delay and it worked shortly after. The 30 day warranty was very re-assuring however I won't be returning this phone. Very happy thanks,5
"This phone is garbage. I've had it for less than three months and it's always having problems. Constantly freezing, kicking me out of apps, and dying way above 0% (yesterday it was at 43% when it decided to die).I had such high hopes for this seller and was very disappointed.",1
"The phone came looking fine, but sometimes the screen glitches and isn't coordinated with where I tap, and sometimes just plain old wigs out and does random things when I'm not even touching the screen. But I can't afford the time to not have a phone so I'm just gonna deal with it for now.",3
"very happy with purchase. phone was in very good shape, very little wear apparent. screen and case looked close to perfect. works just as new and NO trouble getting it on my verizon account (no charge). came exactly as described and on time. Id buy from them again.",5
"as advertised. complete with charger and earbuds (earbuds are no as good as the Originals, but it is nice to have them included) Would purchase from seller again",5
"The phone overall works fine, but I Just didn't like that it came with headphones and not a charger. The screen was really dirty when I opened the box too. I just say never take a picture of stuff that isn't going to be included. False advertising!!",3
"This phone was a promised by the seller. I actually thought I had an issue with the phone and the seller went over the top to help me. The most amazing seller I have ever dealt with. As far as the phone, my daughter LOVES it!",5
"The charging cord it came with sucks. It fried after a week of barely using it so that's really poor quality. Also, the phones volume button is jammed and I barely even use it. I use my earphones to adjust the volume. I wouldn't buy it again. I got it new and it's really causing me problems already.",2
"Received my iphone 5s, bought from thegizmogadgets.. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and looks absolutely new, no visible scratch seen, although the battery is a bit used already but it still fine..",5
What can I say? The phone was FAKE. I took it to Verizon & they tried & tried. We were there for hours. End result- it's NOT A REAL IPHONE. This was my 12 year olds birthday gift.. Shame on these people.,1
"Upgrade for my wife from tracfone, took it to Verizon Corporate store for setup, ready to go in 15 minutes. Ported her old # over. Screen is too small for me (my iPhone 6s is easier for me to see) . Bought this refurbished from Noble Planet after looking at their history. I'm very happy with Noble Planet and with this phone.",4
"Product arrived quickly. Showed signs of minimal wear, just a slight rub mark from when it had been in a case. Was activated thru Verizon online account in a matter of minutes. Functions as expected. No complaints yet, only had it a few days tho. Came in non-factory box, included a new charger in good condition. Pleased with my order.",4
"Terrible. Phone took first charge to 100%. At 30% it went to 0 and turned off. Next charge to %100, then dead after 2 hours. It then wouldn't even take a charge. Garbage",1
"One star, only because I can't give it ZERO. The phone is a Japanese model, which is fine if you have to conform to Japanese laws. I'm not Japanese nor do I live in Japan. Right away I noticed several features I was unable to turn off because of the model of the phone. Entirely unhappy with this purchase.",1
"Phone was in fair condition. The case had more scratches than originally suggested. For the price, however, a great purchase and delivered very quickly.",3
"My iPhone arrived sealed in the box. Everything was perfect! I needed mine for Verizon Wireless, so I can't say if it was unlocked or not. The phone had all the accessories it was supposed to come with and everything works well. I am pleased!",5
"The phone turned out to be a Verizon phone, and was not ""unlocked"" to be used on other networks.This was definitely false advertizing and currently struggling to return it for full refund...do to traveling.",1
"I've had the top of the line Android phones and every single iphone ever and the iphone is the best phone there is and at this rate ever will be...whether it be because of design or performance, it's the better phone.",5
Apple IPhone 5S is working perfectly. No problem getting phone connected thru Verizon service and their free SIMM Card. Very happy with Amazon timely service also.Thank you.,4
"Awesome phone. Works perfect, great price point for brand new phone! Couldn't be happier. Customer service was world class. Will definitely buy here again.",5
"Bought this from Best Price Phones or kugs8989, in February - listed as NEW. Today, June 6, the battery is dead and will not hold a charge. Seller has disappeared. I've had the same model of phone since it was first issued in 2013, and it is still going strong.",1
"The screen had a couple of glitches with brightness initially, but it seems to have resolved and is working well. I would purchase a new phone with this seller again.",4
Major cons: (not negotiable)- speaker phone function is roughly 50% of how loud it needs to be. Makes listening to music or talking to people using the speaker pointless without headphones- Bluetooth function will not even display other devices to link to. Completely inoperable Bluetooth capabilityPros:-clean screen with little scratches or dings,1
Every function on the phone works well however Bluetooth and wireless are broken. Tried several reboots with the software so it must be a hardware issue. Very disappointing. Not worth the $300+ I paid for it.,2
"Phone worked great for like two weeks. Turns out it wasn't brand new at all, screen started ghost clicking and when I took it to the apple store to use the ""warranty"" it comes with they said it wasn't even new and the warranty wouldn't cover it.",1
"I do not know if these reviews are seller specific but I order the phone from ""Next Level Mobile"" which was labeled as ""new"" after around 3.5 months the display was not working, when I brought it to Apple they said they could not fix the problem because it has been replaced with a ""third party display"".",1
"I'll give em a thumbs up. As I will say,they went above & beyond to resolve the error of receiving an incorrect item by error. Impressed with the customer service response & pleased with the product once received.",4
"The phone came looking fine, but sometimes the screen glitches and isn't coordinated with where I tap, and sometimes just plain old wigs out and does random things when I'm not even touching the screen. But I can't afford the time to not have a phone so I'm just gonna deal with it for now.",3
"Had an iPhone5, went to a Galaxy S5 (hated it), went back to iPhone (5S this time). Performance is noticeably better than the iPhone5 and SO much better than my S5 (especially after the Lollipop update). Battery life much better than S5, too. Love it!",5
"Haven't activated this phone yet, as it is a Christmas gift, but the phone is in great condition (as described). So far, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Will update this review, if it is necessary.Update: We absolutely love this phone and I am very satisfied with the purchase.",5

It came quickly and the phone looks like its brand new. My only issue is that it does some weird things whenI try to use it while its charging. Other than that it works perfectly!,4
"My husband got me this iPhone 5s for my birthday. I absolutely love it. The reason I'm only giving it 4/5 stars is because the charger port was just FILLED with lint and junk, affecting its ability to charge. My husband had to dig all the lint out with a safety pin.",4
"I'm super happy with my new phone, it works up to every standard and is fast. When I got the phone I noticed that there is very small wear and tear. Only one or two scratches on the screen but overall I couldn't have asked for a much better phone with this much space for this cheap",5
This product came in earlier than expected. As said in the description this phone did have evidence of usage but if you wear a case on it then you can't see the damage and it looks brand new with a case of it. I love it so much. I would recommend buying this.,5
"Everything was as described, very little wear overall (phone was a little dirty but it cleaned up like new with a little rubbing alcohol). It arrived on time, activation went smoothly and the phone is in great working order. 10/10 would order again.",5
"this is my first smartphone,,s0,,, it will take some time to learn how to use,,battery goes dead in 24 hours with very limited use---that sucks---phone was as listed,, looks good,, works good, i guess",5
"To start with when I took the phone into the store to get it switched with the old one the numbers off of the new box were not good. But when we got the phone out charged it and used the numbers off of it, it worked ok. So at first I was a little heaitant that it was real. It all worked out in the long run though.",4
"It's good, but not as like new as described in condition like new.I think described as very good condition is more reasonable because there are some black points in the back of the cellphone and little scratch in the side.Whatever I'm satisfied with the shopping with the price to get this phone.",3
"The phone overall works fine, but I Just didn't like that it came with headphones and not a charger. The screen was really dirty when I opened the box too. I just say never take a picture of stuff that isn't going to be included. False advertising!!",3

"I got it for my out-of-town daughter, so aside from doing the initial setup, I really don't know how it's working out for her. But my brief experience with it was just fine.",5
"love the phone but not the battery. the battery was so damaged and abused that i had to go get it replaced. also, they sent me a nasty otterbox that was beyond the point of no return with how dirty it was.",3
"The online thing was that it did not come with the verizon Sim card like the description leads you to believe. Overall- VERY fast shipping! Phone is brand new as expected, now just to wait for the SIM card so I can enjoy it!",5

Thrilled to have this iPhone! Still learning how to use it with ALL the features. Don't know what your missing until you have it in your hot little hand. Wonderful machine.,5
"The quality of the product was actually better than I expected, and the delivery also arrived earlier than the projected date which was a plus for me.",5
"Though the phone barely has any scratches or mishandling marks, the iPhone I received has a bad case of ghost tapping. Minus this annoying factor, the iPhone runs smoothly and the battery last as long as any other iPhone.",3
"The operating system failed within 4 months, beyond repair. The warranty with the seller was just 30 days. Very unfriendly return/exchange policy for an expensive item one expects to last at least a couple of years. SELLER/PRODUCT NOT RECOMMENDED.",1
"Although the phone itself was good, it turns out to be a non-verizon machine. which doesn't work with verizon simcard. I think they didn't test it. before selling.",1
This is my 3rd refurbished iPhone from Amazon and I'm very happy. Works great. You can't beat the price and they always guarantee that they work well.,5

I'm real happy with my iPhone 5S it works great has a lot of features on it and I just upgraded me to a better phone I love the tracking system that Amazon offers you know exactly when you're going to receive it,5

I had ran into a problem with my phone just a week after i had it. i took it to the apple store and they said they couldn't do anything to it because it wasn't an Apple product. It was one of those fake phones from China. now i have to invest in another phone.,1
"I was disappointed when I received the phone and found out that it is not usable on Verizon, even though it clearly stated in the description that it is a Verizon cell phone.",1
"Phone is OK, but when I use the earbuds with mic, the mic does not work. I notified the company and was sent two new sets of earbuds. One of the sets does not have sound from the left side. Still cannot use the mic with this phone. Disappointed.",3

This product came in great with no scratches on it! The only issue I had was that I have to leave my cellular data turned on at all times in order for the iMessaging to work. (I just turn on the cellular data and shut it off for all the apps I have so they don't use up all my data),5
Great phone. Did not look used hardly at all. Worked very well. We just took the sim card from the old Verizon Samsung and put it in this one. Very seamless!,5
"I was very nervous about buying an expensive item from Amazon, but I gave it a try and DO NOT regret it! I got my package in record time and it was exactly, if not better, than what I was hoping.",5
"I needed to upgrade my iPhone 4, and wasn't sure what to go with. Turns out I found a decent price in comparison, and it's everything I wanted and more. Love iPhone!",5
"Not too happy with this item. Say you can have connected with Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile but no sim card came with it, price out rages, and can't get it hock up for a phone use. So very unhappy as it took a long time to try all the different cell phone companies and nothing unless we buy a Sims card and still nothing. This was bull.",2
Purchased this phone brand new and it's amazing better than I expected it to be. I had concerns that it wouldn't be as good as it looks but it was great and not sure why there are bad reviews about the company selling it?,5
"The charger, headphone and cable are not original manufacturing. When I try the lightening cable. The handset display ""May not support"". Of course you can avoid that by another side of connector. I think it's good purchasing experience for me. But amazon should improve the quality of peripherals.",4
Very pleased with purchase. The details of the phone noted minor scratches. When I received the phone it looked brand new. It came with new accessories. Highly recommended.,5
"Excellent phone, in flawless condition. Not one single problem and got my phone a few day's earlier than expected... Highly recommend cellcow to all....",5
"Upgrade for my wife from tracfone, took it to Verizon Corporate store for setup, ready to go in 15 minutes. Ported her old # over. Screen is too small for me (my iPhone 6s is easier for me to see) . Bought this refurbished from Noble Planet after looking at their history. I'm very happy with Noble Planet and with this phone.",4
"I was told that this iPhone would work with the Verizon network, but it is for AT&T instead. Otherwise I would love it because the seller was really accommodating and the price was great.",4
"Had it for 4 months now and no issues thankfully. I'm giving 5 stars because it's exactly what it described it as. Some normal wear & tear, but it works well and hasn't let me down yet.",5
"The phone is in fact new and it arrived pretty quickly. I really recommend it. A note was sent along with my phone, I would most definitely buy from them again.",5
Screen started going out shortly after activating the phone. Took it to the apple store to hear that it needs a whole new screen. It is now fully understood why the phone was put up for sale to begin with.,1
"I was expecting to get a phone with a few scratches, but the phone was like new. There were no problems getting it set up and it's working perfectly. I purchased the phone for my son and he's very happy with it.",5
"The phone overall works fine, but I Just didn't like that it came with headphones and not a charger. The screen was really dirty when I opened the box too. I just say never take a picture of stuff that isn't going to be included. False advertising!!",3
"This phone was a promised by the seller. I actually thought I had an issue with the phone and the seller went over the top to help me. The most amazing seller I have ever dealt with. As far as the phone, my daughter LOVES it!",5
"I bought an used - like new one. There are little scratch, but I like it very much. I used it for some days, there was not any problem. But the battery cyclecounts are 292 times, very high rate. So 3 stars.",3
"The phone was nice, but the used model sent came with a broken proximity sensor and the home button was a little funky. We returned it and went through Verizon for a brand new phone instead.",3
"Though the phone barely has any scratches or mishandling marks, the iPhone I received has a bad case of ghost tapping. Minus this annoying factor, the iPhone runs smoothly and the battery last as long as any other iPhone.",3
"The operating system failed within 4 months, beyond repair. The warranty with the seller was just 30 days. Very unfriendly return/exchange policy for an expensive item one expects to last at least a couple of years. SELLER/PRODUCT NOT RECOMMENDED.",1
"Although the phone itself was good, it turns out to be a non-verizon machine. which doesn't work with verizon simcard. I think they didn't test it. before selling.",1
"To start with when I took the phone into the store to get it switched with the old one the numbers off of the new box were not good. But when we got the phone out charged it and used the numbers off of it, it worked ok. So at first I was a little heaitant that it was real. It all worked out in the long run though.",4
"It's good, but not as like new as described in condition like new.I think described as very good condition is more reasonable because there are some black points in the back of the cellphone and little scratch in the side.Whatever I'm satisfied with the shopping with the price to get this phone.",3
"very happy with purchase. phone was in very good shape, very little wear apparent. screen and case looked close to perfect. works just as new and NO trouble getting it on my verizon account (no charge). came exactly as described and on time. Id buy from them again.",5
"as advertised. complete with charger and earbuds (earbuds are no as good as the Originals, but it is nice to have them included) Would purchase from seller again",5
I got this product at the end of September and it worked for about 3 weeks until one day lines appeared on the screen and it is now defective. I would not recommend buying this product unless you want a broken iphone.,1
"Phone was advertised as new, but was defective. Took it to the apple store and they said it came up on their computer as recycled. HMMMM Am having to return it.",1
"Had an iPhone5, went to a Galaxy S5 (hated it), went back to iPhone (5S this time). Performance is noticeably better than the iPhone5 and SO much better than my S5 (especially after the Lollipop update). Battery life much better than S5, too. Love it!",5
"So much faster than my iPhone 4s.Everything came in the box... iPhone, charging cable and plug, Verizon sim card, earplugs. I took it to Verizon to switch over to my new iPhone 5s but the rep in the store told me that I could have done the setup at home. :)",5
"I bought this to replace my iPhone 6 that got stolen a few weeks ago. I couldn't afford to purchase another 6 so I decided the 5S would suffice. I received the phone today and so far, I am very happy with my purchase. It looks like it has never been used and it works perfectly. It arrived much earlier than expected as well so that is a plus!",5
"Product arrived quickly. Showed signs of minimal wear, just a slight rub mark from when it had been in a case. Was activated thru Verizon online account in a matter of minutes. Functions as expected. No complaints yet, only had it a few days tho. Came in non-factory box, included a new charger in good condition. Pleased with my order.",4
"Terrible. Phone took first charge to 100%. At 30% it went to 0 and turned off. Next charge to %100, then dead after 2 hours. It then wouldn't even take a charge. Garbage",1
"I received the phone. The screen was loose. The digitizer was non- responsive. It looked like it was put together in a backyard shack, by a bunch of blind elves. Simply put. It's junk.",1
"They may say its a new screen, but its replaced with a third party aftermarket screen that is not OEM.Apple refuses to service any iphone that has an aftemarket screen.",1
The phone arrived in pristine condition to replace an iPhone 4 my daughter had soaked. It just needed the replacement sim card. I have one and love it for all the features and compact size--easy to slip in a pocket and yet very readable.,5
Apple IPhone 5S is working perfectly. No problem getting phone connected thru Verizon service and their free SIMM Card. Very happy with Amazon timely service also.Thank you.,4
"Awesome phone. Works perfect, great price point for brand new phone! Couldn't be happier. Customer service was world class. Will definitely buy here again.",5
"The online thing was that it did not come with the verizon Sim card like the description leads you to believe. Overall- VERY fast shipping! Phone is brand new as expected, now just to wait for the SIM card so I can enjoy it!",5
"iPhone's battery does not work properly! This was not included in the description. The battery died every 20 minutes unless it was connected to a charger. Once the phone would turn back on, it would say that the battery life was at 30%!",1
"I got this in the mail and it came with a little kit to clean the screen and then a REALLY nice screen protector. It was a nice little surprise. Anyways, I put a phone case on and it looks brand new! It also works great.",5
"Very pleased. I love it. I was expecting more scratches because of shipping but only one or two on back. A small dent on the top of the phone but not noticable in the picture. I would recommend getting this phone, you will not regret it!",5
"Well unfortunately my my phone went swimming and I was forced to decide between buying a new phone for $600 or buy a used one. I got an iPhone 5s in mint condition for less than $200 shipped to my door step in just a few days. Very pleased, would highly recommend this phone and for anybody facing the same situation as me",5
"One star, only because I can't give it ZERO. The phone is a Japanese model, which is fine if you have to conform to Japanese laws. I'm not Japanese nor do I live in Japan. Right away I noticed several features I was unable to turn off because of the model of the phone. Entirely unhappy with this purchase.",1
"Phone was in fair condition. The case had more scratches than originally suggested. For the price, however, a great purchase and delivered very quickly.",3
I bought iphone5s in 2014. but yesterday my earphone was bad.I went to the Apple Store to repair earphone.They told me the earphone is not original earphone.I find I can not find any word in the earphone about Assembled in China.I think you sell me fake accessories！！！I think this is a very serious problem.,1
Had an issue with finger print controls. Customer service outstanding they sent me another phone fast fast fast. Perfect phone. Love the newer features over iphone4,5
This does NOT work on Verizon!!!! Very disappointed and sent back immediately after taking to the Verizon store and being told it couldn't be activated.,1
"I haven't had a lick of trouble when I got this phone. Not one. It works great, came with everything I needed it to come with, is just what I wanted. Great quality.",5
"Bought this from Best Price Phones or kugs8989, in February - listed as NEW. Today, June 6, the battery is dead and will not hold a charge. Seller has disappeared. I've had the same model of phone since it was first issued in 2013, and it is still going strong.",1
"The screen had a couple of glitches with brightness initially, but it seems to have resolved and is working well. I would purchase a new phone with this seller again.",4
Major cons: (not negotiable)- speaker phone function is roughly 50% of how loud it needs to be. Makes listening to music or talking to people using the speaker pointless without headphones- Bluetooth function will not even display other devices to link to. Completely inoperable Bluetooth capabilityPros:-clean screen with little scratches or dings,1
Every function on the phone works well however Bluetooth and wireless are broken. Tried several reboots with the software so it must be a hardware issue. Very disappointing. Not worth the $300+ I paid for it.,2
"Phone worked great for like two weeks. Turns out it wasn't brand new at all, screen started ghost clicking and when I took it to the apple store to use the ""warranty"" it comes with they said it wasn't even new and the warranty wouldn't cover it.",1
"I do not know if these reviews are seller specific but I order the phone from ""Next Level Mobile"" which was labeled as ""new"" after around 3.5 months the display was not working, when I brought it to Apple they said they could not fix the problem because it has been replaced with a ""third party display"".",1
This is my 3rd refurbished iPhone from Amazon and I'm very happy. Works great. You can't beat the price and they always guarantee that they work well.,5
"Went to Verizon Corp store, put the sim card in, turned it on and was up and running in minutes. Completed OS upgrade in 20 minutes, restored iCloud data and was good to go.",4
It came quickly and the phone looks like its brand new. My only issue is that it does some weird things whenI try to use it while its charging. Other than that it works perfectly!,4
"My husband got me this iPhone 5s for my birthday. I absolutely love it. The reason I'm only giving it 4/5 stars is because the charger port was just FILLED with lint and junk, affecting its ability to charge. My husband had to dig all the lint out with a safety pin.",4
"I'm super happy with my new phone, it works up to every standard and is fast. When I got the phone I noticed that there is very small wear and tear. Only one or two scratches on the screen but overall I couldn't have asked for a much better phone with this much space for this cheap",5
Phone came in mail pretty reasonably but the phone won't turn on or take a charge...seller obviously didn't check to make sure it worked before sending it out. They are based out of Brooklyn so I'm sure they are a lot of shady stores there.,1
This cell phone was easy to start up with Verizon. I bought this phone for my daughter who lives out of state so our family could stay connected. My daughter loves this phone.,5
"Bought this phone for my teenager after getting tired of spending ridiculous amounts of money on the ""latest and greatest"". I have had no regrets. The iPhone has worked great and saved me hundreds of dollars over the price of the latest iPhone.",5
"Great form finish, metal and glass feel phenomenal. Cases don't add too much bulk due to already minimal dimensions. Fantastic phone& reliable operating system. Would definitely recommend even in 2016.",5
"Haven't activated this phone yet, as it is a Christmas gift, but the phone is in great condition (as described). So far, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. Will update this review, if it is necessary.Update: We absolutely love this phone and I am very satisfied with the purchase.",5
I bought this phone and then receive a iPhone 5! Not a 5s. Just a 5. I get it. The battery percentage is wrong so my phone shuts off at 35%. My touch screen lags and fidgets all the time. And my microphone hardly works. This company is terrible! Don't ever buy from them!!!,1
I'm not sure how I bought this phone for $350 with 64 gigabytes of internal memory but I did ........and it works perfectly on Verizon Wireless.....can't beat it........ came in great condition.....WIFE loves it.,5
I'm real happy with my iPhone 5S it works great has a lot of features on it and I just upgraded me to a better phone I love the tracking system that Amazon offers you know exactly when you're going to receive it,5
"Received my new Iphone 5s today and looks used. I bought as new and paid new price for the phone. Box was beaten up, had been opened and re taped. Charged the phone and it had already been setup. Will see how it works but not very happy",3
Phone is great! Everything is like it said in the description. Had to go to the I phone store for help setting up but that was a minor delay and it worked shortly after. The 30 day warranty was very re-assuring however I won't be returning this phone. Very happy thanks,5
"This phone is garbage. I've had it for less than three months and it's always having problems. Constantly freezing, kicking me out of apps, and dying way above 0% (yesterday it was at 43% when it decided to die).I had such high hopes for this seller and was very disappointed.",1
"So far so great! I was a little hesitate buying a refurbished phone, but I have had zero issues! It runs great, hardly any scratches or scuffs and the 64GB of storage is amazing compared to the 8GB of storage I had on my iPhone 4S. Really glad I found this awesome deal on Black Friday!",5
"just get the phone ,almost brandnew, no any scratch on the screen or back cover, love it, better then the iPhone 4 what i bought last year. btw, the cable and earphone are orighnal as well, not the cheap copy.",5
Thrilled to have this iPhone! Still learning how to use it with ALL the features. Don't know what your missing until you have it in your hot little hand. Wonderful machine.,5
"The quality of the product was actually better than I expected, and the delivery also arrived earlier than the projected date which was a plus for me.",5
DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. It isn't a new phone. It is jailbroken into and then re-packaged to look new. I spent over 6 hours trying to get this phone to work with verizon only to find out it actually isn't brand new and was actually messed with. Don't buy!!,1
I bought this that the intention that it was new and never used. When i went and brought the phone to the verizon wireless and the phone was definitely already used and registered to another person and i had a problem transferring the phone to my plan.,2
"When I got it, I was expecting some glitches. The first time I plugged it in, it decided to scream beeping noises at me that it couldn't keep up the connection. It has gotten better since then. I just it just needed to be loved again to get better.I still feel like I paid too much.",3
I had ran into a problem with my phone just a week after i had it. i took it to the apple store and they said they couldn't do anything to it because it wasn't an Apple product. It was one of those fake phones from China. now i have to invest in another phone.,1
"The charging cord it came with sucks. It fried after a week of barely using it so that's really poor quality. Also, the phones volume button is jammed and I barely even use it. I use my earphones to adjust the volume. I wouldn't buy it again. I got it new and it's really causing me problems already.",2
"The I-phone met all my expectations related to appearance, however the battery is weak and does not hold charge very well, and I am a very light user, it will need a new battery soon which is an extra $50 !",4
"I'm still using this iphone now after purchasing it months ago, but the fingerprint unlocking mechanism stopped working less than a month in. It's a fine phone but I wish that aspect of it hadn't quit so soon.",4
"Be sure to check out to confirm the phone is fully working within the 30 days. If not, no refund or credit. We purchased a phone and it completely died within (6) months. Should have just bought it through my cell company. I feel for the price I paid, it should work a lot longer.",2
What can I say? The phone was FAKE. I took it to Verizon & they tried & tried. We were there for hours. End result- it's NOT A REAL IPHONE. This was my 12 year olds birthday gift.. Shame on these people.,1
The shipping was on time. It said it would be here Friday by 8pm I got it Friday at 10am. Took the phone to Verizon to activate it and it works! Very pleased and very pleased with the price I paid for a good phone!,5
I bought a refurbished phone and it came in on time. Works very well and since its a refurbished phone then there is still some very light scratched on the side but it doesn't bother me. Overall good buy. Nice camera quality!,5
"Mobile phone appearance at a line still, there is a slight scratches, can accept, but found that the battery is charging when use more than 300 times, for it is not satisfied",2
"Said the phone was in 'Good' condition. There was one tiny pinprick of a scratch on the back, but other than that it is flawless. This company is good. It was also simple to activate.",5
"Purchased as ""used"" but it arrived in like-new condition complete with charger, cable, and ear buds. Been using the phone for several days now and it works exactly as expected. Out of the box, I had to charge it, then took it to the Verizon store where they verified the ESN was clean, and then installed a verizon sim card. No complaints at all.",5
"This is the first phone I've bought on Amazon. I was kind of leery but the phone came within 2 days, with an estimated 5 to 7 business day shipping expectation. The phone was Verizon ready, no scratches, chips, or any kind of damage on the phone. I love it. And would definitely recommend it.",5
A very good device. My only problem is its size. It is heavy in a shirt pocket and inconvenient in hip pocket of a trouser. It slips out very easily from a pocket. I have lost it already 3 times in the last six months but fortunately each time I could find it.,4
Just got my iPhone in the mail thisy 3rd day using it and everything I just like a brand new iPhone 5s no regrets here for the price I got it...... so far.,5
"Good phone and in good condition, but recently discovered that this is only an Iphone 5, not a 5s. Also, it didn't come with the stock earbuds, which are expensive. FALSE ADVERTISING.",2
This was advertised as new. Took it to Apple as the battery was depleted after 2 months. They refused to work on it because the battery was third party as were many of the buttons and inner working!! This was not as advertised at all.,1
"This person is a scam artist. I bought my phone, everything works great for a while, then it is reported that the payments are not being made on it and the IMIE is blocked. This person knows exactly what they are doing and they are criminals.",1
I am super happy with this vendor. The Iphone came in super fast before it was suposeto and it was almost brand new and it works. It was the best purchase I've made. My son is super happy! Thanks,5
"This phone is okay. My son purchased it, he didn't realize how little storage there is. He is constantly deleting nearly all apps and photos to make the phone operable.",3
"Phone was in perfect condition when I got it, everything was fine, until I put the SIM in. Phone was blocked on my network and was reported as stolen. Needless to say, I am NOT happy with this outcome.",1
Great item! Received it a day earlier than expected but works great! Good condition except for stickers on back! Other than that great deal! I reccomend!,5
"As of November 2015 this phones memory is just about full. 16 GB is simply NOT enough space....and I'm not a big ""apps"" person, but I do like to save my pictures. Otherwise I have no complaints.",4
"I just received this ""unlocked"" iphone 5s two days ago and was happy until I but I tried to put my sim card in. No service so I called my carrier T-Mobile and oh guess what the phone has a carrier lock on it with guess who T-Mobile. Needless to say I'm pissed and without a phone or money and have yet to get a reply or a refund. ZERO STARS!!!",1
I enjoy the fingerprint addition so when people are nearby I can just touch the home button to unlock my phone without anyone lurking to see me enter my unlock code.,5
Great phone works well with T-Mobile. Game new out-of-the-box in perfect mint condition. It's the right size phone for me I had a Samsung galaxy S3 before that wouldn't fit in my pocket. This phone is lightning fastsyncs with my iTunes automatically can't say enough good things about it. Seller shipped fast no issues,5
I love this phone! I cut my original Sim card that was in my Samsung Galaxy and put it in the new Iphone 5s and it works great.Internet responds super fast and the fingerprint unlock is amazing. Condition is perfect and it came in the original box. I'm very happy with my purchase.,5
"Don't waste your money on this phone. I bought this phone a month ago and I kept getting this blue screen, then it reboots itself over and over again. Doesn't work well with T-Mobile like it said, I tried sending it back but they won't take it back. One month into my iPhone and I'm now looking to buy another phone.",1
Real iphone 5s. Came in factory box sealed up like an apple store would sell it to you. It has some better features than the 4 and is ALOT faster! I like it! I sanded down my old sim card for my 4 and it fit in my 5 (save $10-20 on a sim card at tmobile),5
Came on time but the charger did not work and did not come with headphones or any manuals. It also did not come with the little key to open the sim slot,3
it crazy if you lunch an app it takes you outcant hear people without headphones and for them you sound farand cant take phonescalls sometimes it impossible would not recomended,1
This was supposed to be new! It's two years old! I was mislead into believing I was buying a new iPhone. Now it's messing up and I went to Apple Store and they told me its two years old and warranty is up! I got ripped of!!!!!!!!!!,1
"Great customer service! I love my new phone! And the best part is I got it from a really good price! Other places were charging me almost 1,000 for this phone but I got it here for 600. I'm very pleased. Thank you.",5
"This is a very good iphone model. There is a problem that hopefully gets resolved later. If you accidentally push the bottom center button to long, it goes into voice over mode that is difficult to get out of!",4
Great Phone!!! Great phone to have in our system. This phone is also feel like is one of our part in our body system. I really enjoy this phone. Without this phone I feel like handicapped.,5
"Perfect perfect perfect! My phone came right on time. I got it and it was like new just as he said. He also sent a charger and a cute pink otter box which was great, because I didn't have to go out and buy one. Thanks!!",5
"i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs though. They are involved with Dr Dre now and I heard they are going to make bigger phones, something Steve Jobs was against. Guess we will see.",5
This person selling this item is a liar .. I asked specifically if this unit is for t mobile. The sell told me yes.. I put a tmobile SIM card in this phone that was sent to me but it did not read because the Carrier was sent to sprint,1
"It all came in a sealed box, the phone was new and works great. My only problem was that the part that connects to the wall to charge doesn't work too well so I had to use a different connector.",5
"Im loving it....So far it works very good no problems, no damages, scratches or anything. Came on time arrived by the 20th which was a couple days ago. It's all what was described about the iPhone 5s and to say im glad i bought it.",5
The phone goes on and off on its own. It also says that the battery is charged and goes dead anytime. I will never purchase a phone from this person ever again. I brought for my daughter cannot call me at times because phone goes dead on its own and with battery says it on 64%.😡,1
Phone arrived quickly as described and worked great for a week. After a day bouncing between Apple and my carrier Apple replaced the phone for a new one. The new phone lasted a week and I had to make another appointment with Apple and they replaced that phone. Quality control could be better. Has all the bells and whistle to keep my daughter happy.,4
"This phone sucks!!😒 Do not waste your money on this product. The first day I got it, it was powering off by itself many times. It always froze. I bought it 4 months ago and now it does not work at all!!! The screen popped out all the time. Even tho it says new it is definitely used! Worst phone I probably ever had !",1
I bought this for a friend.1. The product arrived very quickly. It didn't take the amount of time that amazon said it would so that's always a plus.2. Minimal damage to the phone. It worked like a charm3. It's STILL working. lol. My friend is horrible with phones and yet he's managed to keep this one in tact.,5
"the back camera stopped working, the phone touch screen stops working and i have to restart the phone to get it to work. The phone is a huge disappointment. Not worth what i paid for it.",1
"Phone was fine at first, but after two weeks it was constantly shutting down. The power button got stuck down. Took the phone to Apple and they said it was toast. I was able to return this phone through Amazon though for a full refund and ended up just buying a new I-Phone 6 from my wireless provider.",1
"Probably could've found better prices , also the battery drains fast a few weeks after I bought it, recenty just shut down for no reason when it was at 70% .",3
This seller is amazing! I asked about a million questions and they were More than happy to respond to them. When I got the phone I cut my SIM card down to size and it responded immediately! Phone is basically perfect!!,5
"Had to return the phone. After 10 days of the phone, phone became blocked and could not be used. The phone came out of service and couldn't not be used to call or text.",1
"I read a couple of bad reviews, but my experience its been great. I got a brand new IPhone, in a sealed box with all the accessories and works perfectly fine.",5
"Though fully packaged, it is not totally new.Checking on the Apple support (the Apple web), it says this phone's Telephone Technical Support has already EXPIRED, and only 1 months to Repairs and Service Coverage Expiration Date. Which means it registered about 1 years ago.",2
"Came on time, but a little skeptical about whether or not it was actually new.Other than that the product works great and I'm using it to type this review right now!",5
"Scam, the phone was barred off the network after 1 week due to ""Unpaid payments in the T-Mobile payment plan"", returned immediately to amazon. I'm very disappointed.",1
Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,1
Came on time but the charger did not work and did not come with headphones or any manuals. It also did not come with the little key to open the sim slot,3
Amazing quality. I knew what i was receiving because i already owned an iphone 5S. Unexpected fast delivery. Definitely will buy again ( if i break this one..haha),5
Serious problems with the phone. Isnt compatible with tmobile but says in the factory settings that the carrier is tmobile. Also isn't unlocked like they claim to be. Don't buy the phone it's just a huge hassle,1

"Phone was in perfect condition when I got it, everything was fine, until I put the SIM in. Phone was blocked on my network and was reported as stolen. Needless to say, I am NOT happy with this outcome.",1
Great item! Received it a day earlier than expected but works great! Good condition except for stickers on back! Other than that great deal! I reccomend!,5
"Had to return the phone. After 10 days of the phone, phone became blocked and could not be used. The phone came out of service and couldn't not be used to call or text.",1
"I read a couple of bad reviews, but my experience its been great. I got a brand new IPhone, in a sealed box with all the accessories and works perfectly fine.",5
The phone goes on and off on its own. It also says that the battery is charged and goes dead anytime. I will never purchase a phone from this person ever again. I brought for my daughter cannot call me at times because phone goes dead on its own and with battery says it on 64%.😡,1
"Good phone and in good condition, but recently discovered that this is only an Iphone 5, not a 5s. Also, it didn't come with the stock earbuds, which are expensive. FALSE ADVERTISING.",2
This was advertised as new. Took it to Apple as the battery was depleted after 2 months. They refused to work on it because the battery was third party as were many of the buttons and inner working!! This was not as advertised at all.,1
"This person is a scam artist. I bought my phone, everything works great for a while, then it is reported that the payments are not being made on it and the IMIE is blocked. This person knows exactly what they are doing and they are criminals.",1
Came on time but the charger did not work and did not come with headphones or any manuals. It also did not come with the little key to open the sim slot,3
Amazing quality. I knew what i was receiving because i already owned an iphone 5S. Unexpected fast delivery. Definitely will buy again ( if i break this one..haha),5
I am super happy with this vendor. The Iphone came in super fast before it was suposeto and it was almost brand new and it works. It was the best purchase I've made. My son is super happy! Thanks,5
"Don't waste your money on this phone. I bought this phone a month ago and I kept getting this blue screen, then it reboots itself over and over again. Doesn't work well with T-Mobile like it said, I tried sending it back but they won't take it back. One month into my iPhone and I'm now looking to buy another phone.",1
"Though fully packaged, it is not totally new.Checking on the Apple support (the Apple web), it says this phone's Telephone Technical Support has already EXPIRED, and only 1 months to Repairs and Service Coverage Expiration Date. Which means it registered about 1 years ago.",2
"Came on time, but a little skeptical about whether or not it was actually new.Other than that the product works great and I'm using it to type this review right now!",5
"Scam, the phone was barred off the network after 1 week due to ""Unpaid payments in the T-Mobile payment plan"", returned immediately to amazon. I'm very disappointed.",1
Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,1
"Great customer service! I love my new phone! And the best part is I got it from a really good price! Other places were charging me almost 1,000 for this phone but I got it here for 600. I'm very pleased. Thank you.",5
"This is a very good iphone model. There is a problem that hopefully gets resolved later. If you accidentally push the bottom center button to long, it goes into voice over mode that is difficult to get out of!",4
Great Phone!!! Great phone to have in our system. This phone is also feel like is one of our part in our body system. I really enjoy this phone. Without this phone I feel like handicapped.,5
"As of November 2015 this phones memory is just about full. 16 GB is simply NOT enough space....and I'm not a big ""apps"" person, but I do like to save my pictures. Otherwise I have no complaints.",4
"I just received this ""unlocked"" iphone 5s two days ago and was happy until I but I tried to put my sim card in. No service so I called my carrier T-Mobile and oh guess what the phone has a carrier lock on it with guess who T-Mobile. Needless to say I'm pissed and without a phone or money and have yet to get a reply or a refund. ZERO STARS!!!",1
I enjoy the fingerprint addition so when people are nearby I can just touch the home button to unlock my phone without anyone lurking to see me enter my unlock code.,5
Great phone works well with T-Mobile. Game new out-of-the-box in perfect mint condition. It's the right size phone for me I had a Samsung galaxy S3 before that wouldn't fit in my pocket. This phone is lightning fastsyncs with my iTunes automatically can't say enough good things about it. Seller shipped fast no issues,5
I love this phone! I cut my original Sim card that was in my Samsung Galaxy and put it in the new Iphone 5s and it works great.Internet responds super fast and the fingerprint unlock is amazing. Condition is perfect and it came in the original box. I'm very happy with my purchase.,5
Serious problems with the phone. Isnt compatible with tmobile but says in the factory settings that the carrier is tmobile. Also isn't unlocked like they claim to be. Don't buy the phone it's just a huge hassle,1

"It all came in a sealed box, the phone was new and works great. My only problem was that the part that connects to the wall to charge doesn't work too well so I had to use a different connector.",5
"Probably could've found better prices , also the battery drains fast a few weeks after I bought it, recenty just shut down for no reason when it was at 70% .",3
"This phone sucks!!😒 Do not waste your money on this product. The first day I got it, it was powering off by itself many times. It always froze. I bought it 4 months ago and now it does not work at all!!! The screen popped out all the time. Even tho it says new it is definitely used! Worst phone I probably ever had !",1
Phone arrived quickly as described and worked great for a week. After a day bouncing between Apple and my carrier Apple replaced the phone for a new one. The new phone lasted a week and I had to make another appointment with Apple and they replaced that phone. Quality control could be better. Has all the bells and whistle to keep my daughter happy.,4
Real iphone 5s. Came in factory box sealed up like an apple store would sell it to you. It has some better features than the 4 and is ALOT faster! I like it! I sanded down my old sim card for my 4 and it fit in my 5 (save $10-20 on a sim card at tmobile),5
"Perfect perfect perfect! My phone came right on time. I got it and it was like new just as he said. He also sent a charger and a cute pink otter box which was great, because I didn't have to go out and buy one. Thanks!!",5
"i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs though. They are involved with Dr Dre now and I heard they are going to make bigger phones, something Steve Jobs was against. Guess we will see.",5
This person selling this item is a liar .. I asked specifically if this unit is for t mobile. The sell told me yes.. I put a tmobile SIM card in this phone that was sent to me but it did not read because the Carrier was sent to sprint,1
I bought this for a friend.1. The product arrived very quickly. It didn't take the amount of time that amazon said it would so that's always a plus.2. Minimal damage to the phone. It worked like a charm3. It's STILL working. lol. My friend is horrible with phones and yet he's managed to keep this one in tact.,5
"the back camera stopped working, the phone touch screen stops working and i have to restart the phone to get it to work. The phone is a huge disappointment. Not worth what i paid for it.",1
"Phone was fine at first, but after two weeks it was constantly shutting down. The power button got stuck down. Took the phone to Apple and they said it was toast. I was able to return this phone through Amazon though for a full refund and ended up just buying a new I-Phone 6 from my wireless provider.",1
"Good phone and in good condition, but recently discovered that this is only an Iphone 5, not a 5s. Also, it didn't come with the stock earbuds, which are expensive. FALSE ADVERTISING.",2

"Im loving it....So far it works very good no problems, no damages, scratches or anything. Came on time arrived by the 20th which was a couple days ago. It's all what was described about the iPhone 5s and to say im glad i bought it.",5
The phone goes on and off on its own. It also says that the battery is charged and goes dead anytime. I will never purchase a phone from this person ever again. I brought for my daughter cannot call me at times because phone goes dead on its own and with battery says it on 64%.😡,1

A very good device. My only problem is its size. It is heavy in a shirt pocket and inconvenient in hip pocket of a trouser. It slips out very easily from a pocket. I have lost it already 3 times in the last six months but fortunately each time I could find it.,4
Just got my iPhone in the mail thisy 3rd day using it and everything I just like a brand new iPhone 5s no regrets here for the price I got it...... so far.,5

"I loved it when it first came , kinda took alil long but when I started using it , it started action up , the screen would turn blue & just turn off and it won't start up unless it wants to , I had a whole day without a phone until I plugged in the charger 🙄",3
"I was amazed at how good of condition this phone was actually in, and it was a great price. I actually work for Target Mobile and sell phones, and I got more than I expected. I searched for almost a whole month for a good deal to make me push the confirm payment button. I definitely do not regret getting it.",5
"Phone does NOT work with ATT and is associated with a completely different phone. I ordered a Iphone 5s 64GB gold, received a platinum also IMIE is listed as a blue 8GB 5C. This can NOT be used, i basically bought an overpriced ipod.",1
The iPhone was unlocked one which makes it easy to use in the States & aboard. Working very well.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F3J2N6W/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_9,5
"All the bells and whistles I need and then some. Beautiful, nice comfortable size, and works well. I especially like the large memory capacity to holds lots of pictures (which are pretty good quality) as well as apps, etc. Kudos to the seller as well.",5
"My phone broke, I needed a new one and to Amazon we went. The phone was exactly how it was described. I love when I get what I pay for!!! It's amazing at how new the phone looked once I opened it, although it was used. Would definitely purchase from this seller again",5

It works great. It hasn't overheated or the battery isn't damaged like the other reviews said. I was scared to buy it at first because of the reviews but it hasn't had any problems.,5
"This phone states it is AT&T compatible and unlocked but AT&T could not activate the phone, said that Verizon would have to unlock it.I purchased 8 for a business and probably will have to return them all. Called the seller and they gave me a song and dance abouthow I could unlock the phone. If it is advertised unlocked, it should be unlocked.",1
"I've had this phone for about a month now, and so far, other than being laggy 2 or 3 times, it's worked perfectly! I would have liked a little bit more protection around the phone inside the box during shipping, but both the phone and the charger work as new.",4
"After my last iPhone when kaput, and my dad wouldn't buy me another one, I had no choice but to shop for used phones from Amazon. After selecting this one and taking the chances on a used phone, I was pleasantly surprised. For a great price I received this phone and have not regretted my decision in the least. Five stars!!!",5
"this phone works great! Came in a nice box with a charger, and doesn't have ANY noticeable flaws. The phone runs smoothly like I just bought it from Apple. Thanks!!!",5
the outside of the phone is in excellent shape. It was locked when we received it so we had to pay to have it unlocked. It freezes and erases saved content due to a bug we again had to fix. I think overall its okay.,2
The phone itself is great. But this phone is NOT UNLOCKED for other carriers. It is an ATT phone and it would not register and I couldn't get a SIMS card to activate with any other carrier. I spent plenty of time trying. I feel cheated for trusting product description and advertisement.,2
"The phone didn't come with a charger, then when I got it the home button does not work, then I've only had it for a few weeks and it stopped working already.",1
"Although the phone that I purchased didn't read my GSM sim card, the seller was amazing and gave me a refund for a new phone immediately. I guess I had just received a bad apple, but that doesn't mean the rest of the phones are bad as well. :-)",3
"Unit works well and am very satisfied. However, the charging unit is worthless. It has been iffy since I purchased it but now (3 months later) it no longer charges and gets error message that charger is not compatible with Apple unit. Makes iPhone useless without additional expense.",3
Good afternoon.I am writing to you in order to notify them that estiy having problems with the iPhone 5s buy. The Start button is unresponsive and some applications remain unanswered. could you tell me how I can resolve this. after making my purchase. I read several pages in this cell came with problems. but he had already made the purchase.,1
"Unlocked? If you are an AT&T customer maybe that is true but this phone would simply not work for Verizon. Find another seller this phone was in perfect condition but not capable of doing what the description says. What an enormous waste of time buying, bringing to the Verizon store, having them tell me it is not unlocked and having to return it.",1
"The phone was in decent condition just some scratches but nothing that couldn't be covered up with a case. Only hardware issue it seemed to have was the Touch ID it won't scan my finger print overall definitely worth the price and arrived quickly, very pleased!",3
I Recieved This Phone May 4th.. The Phone Came In Excellent Shape With Charger! I'm Pretty Sure It Works With Any GSM SIM Card Because I Put My MetroPCS SIM In It & It Worked After I Called Metro.... I Recommend You Buy It!!,5
Although this phone was supposed to work with my provider US Cellular it did not I traveled extensively to stores to find someone who could turn this phone but its system did not comply .,1
"I am not pleased with this iphone5s.....the screen freezes, when someone calls I can't swipe the screen......I hate I purchased this iPhone from Amazon......",1
Received item as specified on website. The only problem was that it didn't come with a charger. All of that money spent and there wasn't a charger to go with the phone.,3
Actually 0 stars. DO NOT BUY. They LIE. Claim the phone is new. It started freezing after a month. Convenient for them. I contact Apple. Lo and behold the phone is KNOWN AS DEFECTIVE. Now they won't refund because of the time. They also won't post a truthful review on their site if it's not glowing. BEWARE!,1
"Got the phone and it came as expected. GSM unlocked, clean phone. It did have a couple of dings/scratches but as to be expected. Currently still using the same phone, still holding as well as it did when it came in.",5
"Read some bad reviews about used phones. I was a bit concerned as the description mentioned there may be wear and scratches on housing (not screen). We had no issues. No scratches, preformed well, charges fully. LIKE NEW!Been working great since we received it Friday (8/19/16).",5

It came set in Russian and had pictures and video on it. The sticker said 'new' means brand new or reset to factory settings. Misleading on website as there is another section for 'used'.,2
"The vibrate didn't work on the phone from day one. Two months after purchasing it started shutting itself off and back on in a continuos loop. I got that fixed for a lot of money, and then the battery died and the phone won't even turn back on. These phones are junk. Don't buy them.",1
"Good evening, I write to you this time to inform you that the device does not turn on the screen wanted to verify with you what type of warranty covers this technical failure.",5
"Phone had some issues upon arrival such as lacking some sensibility to touch making it more difficult to use, managed to crack slightly from simply holding the phone making it even harder to use - wonder if phone was damaged prior",2
"I love it. I never had an iPhone before and I am so glad I bought this one. It is just like new and I have seen others like this on ""sale"" for over $500.00 so I got a great deal.",5
"As far as the iPhone goes I like it. As far as this particular one, the screen is sometimes unresponsive requiring a restart. Not cool.update. downgrading to one star. it quit on me last night. it is still on, but the screen wont come on. am having to return it and I cant even wipe it before i do. not cool.",1
"Arrived on time, quick shipment! The phone arrived in its original box & factory sealed by Apple. Received my order in less than 24 hours. Plus I got it for a great price! Highly recommended!",5
I am sorry I never wrote a review for you when you I purchased this. Phone was exactly as described and works great. We some issues getting it set up because it was still on the buyers apple account. The buyer worked fast on getting it removed and we were able to add to our provider within two days. Thank You!,5
Product is great and meet my expatations of a telephone what is needed to experience the modern world. Maybe wen ordered from Europe the adapter can be fit to match the european electricity outlets.Regards Peter,5
"I had the iPhone 4S before and was waiting to upgrade to a newer version but didn't really see the need with the iPhone 5, I'm so glad I waited because I'm in love with my new phone. It came just as it was described and the seller communicated with me in reguards to any questions I had, I would deffenately buy from this seller again in the future.",5
"I didn't read all description, so I thought that the product was available for all phone carriers. When I wanted to activate with other carrier and I couldn't do that, I reread the complete description and understood which was my problem.",4
"I was scared to buy a phone online because I didn't want it to be broken, but I'm so happy this phone is perfect. Works great no scratches. Very friendly, buy their stuff!",5
"I've had this phone for about two months now and I absolutely love it! It's a great phone. One problem though, the brightness sometimes changes by itself even with auto-brightness turned off. Other than that, it's a great phone.",5
"The phone I got was highly used, many dinks on the side. the front touch screen was replaced with after market junk. The touch screen stopped working after two weeks. The wifi and LTE data also slowed to a crawl. I don't recommend a used iPhone.",1
Was doing really good. Now this week my screens are freezing up i have to push home button and turn back on to get messages or my square. sometimes freezes up while i am using it. is a pain to use square to collect money for my sales and turn off and on couple of times to complete a transaction.,3
"I'm writing this review after using the phone over a year. It was easy to hook up w sprint right out of the box, and has been working well for me since Dec 2015. I can upgrade to a new phone now but haven't because there is no need -this refurbished phone still functions without noticeable hiccups.",5
Item was ok.WARNING: IT does not come with a SIM card. Must have a SIM card from the carrier to be able to activate/ use it. Had to order a nano SIM card to make it work (still waiting on those to be delivered),2
"the phone speakers broke after a month and a half. do not buy from them. they are a 3rd party who ""fixes"" phones with tape to hold parts together. buying from them was the biggest mistake of my life. i thought they were posing as apple and sold me a crapy phone. THEY ARE FAKE!!!! DO NOT TRUST THEM!!!!",1
I really really LOOVVEEE this iPhone ! 😍😍 thank you soooooooooooooooo much ! I couldn't ask for Better . and for a cheap price ? this is excellent . it looks brand new but you have to buy your own charger and box AND headphones but the phone is still worth it ! make sure you charge the phone before you deliver it though . :/,5
"Was advertised as a refurbished phone. But it was used not refurbished. Refurbished almost always have a new shell. But are to definitely be fully tested. More rigorous testing than new products. However, this phone was scratched up. And microphone is not working at 100%. As others he me as muffled.",2
"This was an amazing upgrade for us since we were still using a 3Gs. I would prefer a more solid battery, and I wish that voice control/siri could function w/o internet access but other than that; it's a good product at this price point.",4
"Paid almost $20 extra for overnight shipping, phone came 4 days later, plugged in the charger n it started smoking. Phone it's self was as advertised and works fine just wish it was a better overall experience.",3
"Came as advertised, put in the SIM Card, registered phone with provider, syncd with ITunes and was up in no time at all. Was a new locked phone for Sprint and couldn't have worked any better. Quick delivery, excellent product and I couldn't be happier.",5
"My apologies - I didn't know that my phone is synced with my hearing aids - and, therefore, ""blue tooth"" is on all the time. So, that is causing the battery to run down faster than I'm used to. The phone is just fine and the vendor was most cooperative.",4
"I bought this Iphone because I wanted to use it in Mexico but it doesn't work, on the website description said that It just works in US just with sprint but in others countries it would work totally fine like Mexico, so I would like to return it.",1
The sound did not work properly which makes it hard if you can't hear text messages or people when you answer the phone. First and foremost it must work as a phone. Customer service was great at facilitating returns but it would have been nice to double check everything before shipping things out.,1
The description said never been out of the box when I got it there was NO box NO booklet NO charger. besides that I love the phone no scratches no nothing.,3
"this is a great phone! It arrived in perfect, new condition. No SIM card, but Apple took care of that quickly and with no charge. It arrived quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas",5
"this is a great phone! It arrived in perfect, new condition. No SIM card, but Apple took care of that quickly and with no charge. It arrived quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas",5
"Not sure about a used phone in this price range, but very happy with the cost and it is much better condition than expected. Already past the 30-days and no problems. Works great. I will buy more phones like this.",5
Overall it's a good productBut I did see some minor blemishes such as scratches also the screen was popped out in one corner but the technology was fine,3
before ordering the iphone 5s i was like man whats the point of touch id it sounds like a stupid gimmick. in reality its a great tool for phone security because people don't see you put in your password. I also like that it's faster to log into my phone.,5
This phone is absolutely amazing & this is the first iPhone I've ever had :). The battery is better than Android because I only need to charge it every 2 days instead of everyday. It's very well designed & I'll stick with Apple for a very long time haha.,3
I'am very satisfied with purchasing my new phone. Everything described was exactly true about the conditions of the phone which looks practically new. I would reccomend anyone to get their phone with them :),5
So far this phone has been exactly what I wanted it for! It was nice to get an Iphone for a lower price and not have to shell out the big bucks!A few times the phone has had some glitches but it worked after restarting it. But overall what I wanted!!,4
Phone works and was in really good condition the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I ordered a silver iphone and recieved the space grey iphone.,4
It was a nice and brand new phone but it wasn't factory unlocked so I had a hard time getting it to work. I had to call 3 different companies and none could provide me with an unlock code so I had to make the decision to send this phone back and settle for a different phone that is unlocked.,2
Ordered this phone thinking it was a sprint phone.. I went to activate it on the sprint network and it isn't actually a sprint phone.. Very frustrated.,1
The phone has been to the AT&T store twice and help from Apple Support . It may have serious problems. Not sure iif I should send it back or give it more time.,2
"Good price. Phone is immaculate. Fast delivery. No issues. Love the phone, much better than the 5c I had. Touch ID is a nice feature. Wonderful camera.",5
"Great, connection is lost at times but maybe the connection is due to ATT. Didn't come with charger like supposed to. But works great. Came charged. Almost new.",4
"Amazing phone. I woke up the next morning after using the phone, I named her Siri; and she made me coffee. I come home from work and all my clothes are folded and put away nicely. What an amazing phone the 5S is. The only problem is we can't take a shower together, something about the water Siri doesn't like. I love my 5S. <3",5
Very disapionted as I'm in Australia and the fone can't be used I understood fone locked for sprint but would axept overseas sim for use out side the states stuck with a fone that the carriers won't unlock,1
Terrible! It is a Sprint phone and they couldn't turn it on. I tried to return it but never heard back from the seller. Then I tried to unlock it and have T-Mobile turn it on. They couldn't do it either. This was a waste of my money!!!!,1
"Shipped perfectly. Using flawlessly for months on end. Would suggest buying a SIM card with it unless you live close to a Spring store, I had to make three trips to get it working properly. However, that isn't the buyer's fault, Sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10",5
I was very excited to receive the phone in a short amount of time and to see it was basically brand new and had some charge in it so I could activate it right away! I was also very happy that it came with not 1 but 2 chargers!,5
"The phone was shipped quickly, however I received the iPhone 5 instead of the 5s model that the title and description state it is. Needed a new phone as soon as possible so I didn't return the item. It works great and looked brand new. I'm just disappointed I didn't get what I thought I was paying for.",3
"Appearance of the phone was perfect, unfortunately after 93 days of ownership the video blew out. There was no physical damage to the phone, it just stopped functioning and does not appear repairable.",1
"No complaints, people should read and understand what they going to buy before they start complaining, got my phone in very good condition, for the price and very honest services..",5
"It got here fast, order got here in 2 days standard shipping. I love it, looks new came in IPhone box with ear buds, and charger. Could not have ask for anything better. Will recommend to everybody. Thanks for the phone!",5
"Didn't realize how small the screen was...much smaller than my LG which got damaged. I don't like the sound on this. I am unable to put my vm's on speaker so can barely hear my messages, even with the volume at max. The one thing I do like is it since with all my other Apple devices.",3
I should've upgraded ages ago but was too cheap. So glad I can finally get rid of my 4s and be up to speed with the rest of the world! The 5s is so much faster and more responsive. The cable that came with my phone stopped working after just a couple weeks but I replaced it with an Amazon cable and we are good to go.,5
The home button made a clicking sound every time i pressed it and it took a fall and the back camera went out i pulled it apart fixed but forgot to put something on it and then it wouldnt turn on the motherboard went but that was my fault really,3
"this phone was in great shape when I got it and was exactly as they said! I was worried about it being broken or defective, but the phone is working great and I have absolutely no problems :)",5
Works and arrived as advertised. I feel the the motherboard was scrapped from a 4s because it shows up on AT&T and iTunes as a 4s. I crossed-checked the serial number through Apple and it says it is a 5s so the controlling component must have been from a 4s. Other than that I'm happy with the purchase.,4
"Phone is a bit more quirky than I'd hoped, touchscreen seems to lose letters and motions here and there, but I think that's just iOS8 being weird, hopefully it'll get better with the next update.",4
"Phone works fine, but went through the run around to get a SIM card. NO...the phone doesn't come with one. Luckily, I was able to get one from Apple because Sprint doesn't have them to give to customers.",3
"Phone was still owned by previous owner and his/her name wasn't clear from at&t, therefore have trouble activating the phone.Update: Resolve when speak with at&t representative, showing them the receipt that I purchase this phone.",1
"Phone was in excellent condition. The price and the quality of the device are unparalleled to any other phone product on Amazon. I would not only reuse this service if needed, but would recommend to anyone that asked.",5
Shh .. This is a Christmas Gift from Santa Clause! This phone arrived before the due date & get this .. It came with EXTRAS that wasn't even mentioned or known! I was exstatic when I opened the package & saw everything so I definitely know my recipient of this gift will be too!!!,5
"This phone has been exactly what I expected and wanted. Moreover, the seller was fantastic, did a great job of transferring the phone, packing and shipping securely and promptly.",5
"My wife's iPhone 4 died and she wanted a new one, but didn't want to commit to another 2-year contract. I bought this new from Amazon for $250 less than what Sprint would charge me.",5
Its permanently locked to Sprint and I am travelling to a different country. Now I am not able to use it as its locked.This information was missing during the time of purchase.,1
I was a little skeptical at first but once I received the phone and activated I was incredibly happy with what I bought I recommend this seller to anybody looking to buy an iPhone on amazon. 5 start quality for sure,5
"When I got my iPhone it was in new condition, but the iPhone was defective, the phone would do a blue screen loop, and then put itself into recovery mode every single night, when I went to go recover it, halfway it would fail. Thankfully the iPhone had the 1 year warranty still I'm effect, so I brought it to the apple store and got a new iPhone.",5
Phone sold as new was not had been activated 6 months early and we could not activate through apple or iTunes. Theregote I feel time snd money wasted.,1
Bought the new iphone to try it so far so good. It really isnt TOO GREAT i have been using other phones like the Xperia Z2 although Iphone 5S has some cool new features like the fingerprint scanner it isnt really something that changes the game.... It is the kind of features that u use the first time u buy the phone and then forget about,3
This is a great phone. iPhone 5S is a great phone. Can do many things. Like multi-tasking is great. The #5 version is a stronger and very popular to work. The pictures are the most easiest for a touch phone. And much faster then the iPhone 4. Try it I think you would like it. I recently bought this for a friend of mine. And she thinks its great.,5
I purchased the phone used for $350 and have been using it for the past month. I recommend the phone at this price point.Pros:Good cameraTouch ID is accurate and convenientGood 4 inch sizeFast processorPurchased 1 year used and it still works wellIt runs iOS 8.1Cons:Home button works but has a small clicking sound.No Apple pay/ NFC,5
It was unblocked and never been unblocked. Charger was so dirty and disgusting! I could not finalize talk to seller who promised to unlock the phone but never did,1
"Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service.",1
Ordered three of these phones and non of them would connect to Sprint's network. Sprint told me that they were incompatible with their system. They were also not new phones and were refurbished.,1
I have not even had this phone for a month and now the home button does not work!! Have not dropped it I don't know why it just stopped working from one day to the next very disappointed!! Also the screen on the side looks like it is about to pop out any minute!!,1
"Recently purchased this iPhone about 1 month or 2 months ago, sometimes it decides not to charge and then screen frezzes. its a ""NEW"" iPhone but its giving me problems..",3
"this item arrived perfectly fine, on time and it looked great on the outside but the part where it charges the phone was old, moldy and burnt, and there is no way to fix it. I wasted $250.",1
"Phone came in the mail dead with a scratch on the screen. Once I charged it up and tried it out, multiple letters on the keyboard did not work. To top it off, after one day of owning this ""good conditioned"" iPhone, the screen went completely bizarre. Terrible seller.",1
excellent condition and working perfect. Don't do an upgrade from your carrier to get a phone because it went bad. I'm happy with this and I'm not in another 2 yr contract with AT&T,5
This phone came in great shape. No visible scratches at all. We had no problems at all getting Sprint service added. And so far no problems and works great. So glad we bought this phone at such a great price.,5
"When this phone arrived, it either wasn't unlocked or wasn't an ATT compatible phone which is what we supposedly bought. It won't activate on our line which makes it basically pointless.",1
I was skeptical about ordering a used iPhone but I am thrilled with the phone I received. It is in perfect condition and exactly as advertised. Not a flaw on it that I can see. The SIM card from my old phone was too big. I took it to an ATT store and they cut it to fit. No charge. My phone was working the same day I received it.,5
Overall a nice little phone though the antennae seems a little week to me. I was up in the mountains near my home and my sons cheap go phone had better reception. Both phones are AT&T...,4
"Came as claimed. Near flawless condition... I couldn't find anything wrong with it if I tried. Only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum... No apple logo or and writing, at all. But it grew on me its very sleek. Phone operates as expected and is lightning fast. I would suggest to anyone.",5
This phone has worked great for me for two years now. I also hate cases and have dropped it a thousand times preparing myself for the worst when I pick it up and it's still in great condition.,5
"This was a upgrade from the 5c. The only issue i had was that this phone did not come with a SIM card, but the nice guy i called at ATT told me what to do, and this phone works like a charm! i am SO happy!The phone was in excellent shape, one minor blemish that is easily ignored (or covered with a sparkly phone case).",5
IT was not totally fine. It has a rattle like the insides don't quite fit tightly. I am having some issues with it not responding to internet quickly. But this does not happen all the time.,3
"I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED!",1
Ordered this as a gift for my daughter's 17th birthday and so far she's in love with it. Everything was as described and it even arrived earlier than expected!,5
I was hoping this wouldn't be a crApple product but after less than 2 months of use the phone shuts off randomly & as of lately refusing to boot up for hours.This is absolutely disgusting.,1
I ordered another IPhone before this one & was given one with scratches & the lock screen did not work. This one came as explained in the bio! Works great came in mint condition I love my IPhone!,5
"I needed to recieve this by Christmas as a gift for my boyfriend and did! The seller has great communication via email, and inturn was able to provide ideal customer service. The product is working great and my boyfriend had the best christmas ever. Thank you!",5
"I bought this iphone the other day and I am absolutely in love. Everything came as described. I had the iphone 4s prior to this phone and was inneed of a upgrade, Im very satisfied with the iphone 5s, battery lasts much longer and the camera is way better on this phone. I recommend people to order this phone from here, it really is worth it!",5
"I love my phone and it is in great condition but it is an Iphone 5 not a 5S and I payed for a 5S not a 5. The shipping and the quality of the phone was great, but I wanted a 5S.",2
"Phone I got was in decent visual condition. However, battery does not last with more than 1 hour of use. Also, after 3 days the speaker stopped working. Buyer beware, these are junk refurbished phones.",1
"Very undone. Speaker was blown, front facing had to replaced as well as the battery after I found out it was an aftermarketed replacement that was too thick for the facing to seat correctly. Overall spent over $200 to have it in basic standings",1
There wasn't a SIMS card with it. Which my have been my fault for not double checking out reading through everything. I'm not sure they advertised no SIM card though. But it was in great shape and exactly what I was looking for. No scratches or problems either. Also the charger they sent me didn't work.,3
My son does not get the best of signal when at home or in small town areas. But overall he seems to enjoy this phone and has no other complaint. Package came as promised and delivered late due to a mix up but was refunded the shipment before phone arrived. Overall very satisfied,4
"It's really good! But sometimes, it doesn't find good signal! I don't know why... If it's the cellphone, or if it's the carrier! The product is amazing, what I had found",4
We are very satisfied with our purchase. The dealer answered questions promptly and communicated with professionalism. would definitely recommend people purchase from this site and this dealer. will be purchasing again soon. Product exceeded my expectations. very satisfied.,5
currently very very pleased with this phone!! i bought it refurbished and it is like brand new. i have had no problems so far and hope i don't have to encounter any.,5
"Phone does not say percentage by the battery, caused me problems when I was restoring it. Charger is FAKE. Not pleased because of that. The phone is also causing me problems with music. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate the phone a 6.",3
"I have had some erratic incidents that I had not had with my previous 5s. Eventually they went away, but it has caused me to question the product or the source a bit.",3
"As far as the iPhone goes I like it. As far as this particular one, the screen is sometimes unresponsive requiring a restart. Not cool.update. downgrading to one star. it quit on me last night. it is still on, but the screen wont come on. am having to return it and I cant even wipe it before i do. not cool.",1
This is the second time I've bought an iPhone online. I wish I'd known about this company the first time around. The phone is exactly as it was described! It works and looks perfect! Would absolutely buy from them again! Thank you so much!,5
The phone is beautiful. However i only had a couple of problems with it. The top left corner is glitchy and there is a red dot on the lcd display when turned on. Other than that the phone is perfect. I would buy from this seller again.,3
"Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service.",1
Ordered three of these phones and non of them would connect to Sprint's network. Sprint told me that they were incompatible with their system. They were also not new phones and were refurbished.,1
"Arrived early and came as described (minor imperfections on back surface). My sister lost her previous sprint iPhone & this is for her birthday! Hopefully, easy set-up with sprint...",4
"One of three phones I bought this month from Amazon third-party because of ""drowned"" phones. This was one was as described (or better). Shipping was very fast! Very satisfied so far!",5
"After some issues, not by the seller, the Item was as described. It's perfect! And they gave me a car charger and two phones cases for the mishap. Thank you!",5
"The phone does not hold a charge for over 3 hours, the auto rotate function does not work, the compass does not funtion. To sum it up, if I were to have a second chance I would NOT buy a used phone here.",1
This phone was in great condition I have had it for about a month now and I haven't had any problems it was a great purchase great price all around great,5
It arrived sealed in the box phone works and looks great the Apple iPhone 5s is extremely easy to use I actually purchased it for my twelve year old daughter and she has not put it down it was a great gift for her,5
"I bought it as new but when i get it today and opened it it was used and broken, i did not activated it yet going to do it tomorrow hope it will work i am very upset.",1
"this is a great phone! It arrived in perfect, new condition. No SIM card, but Apple took care of that quickly and with no charge. It arrived quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas",5
"The product is marked as like new, but the mobilephone i received screen scratches.And the top of the screen will be dented with a little strength,use my hand.",3
My new iphone 5s arrived ahead of schedule. My iphone 5s arrived in very good condition without any incidents. The price was just right.Now I can purchase my iwatch. Thanks James Thom,5
"I did not realize that the phone was not unlocked and made ​​the mistake to buy it for the Sprint company. I live in Argentina , and wanted to know if you know any way to unlock it or I can send some code to do it?",4
"Bought this phone to replace 4S, but have had nothing but trouble. The camera only works toward the texter, not out the back the right way. My I tunes and computer do not recognize it at all. How do I get a refund?",1
I really like the iphone 5S. It is my first and only smart phone so I can't judge it according to other makes. The learning curve is terrible an Apple does't tell you much about using it even starting. They assume you know the basics of smart phones apparently. Amazon Warehouse were excellent to do business with.,5
The description said never been out of the box when I got it there was NO box NO booklet NO charger. besides that I love the phone no scratches no nothing.,3
Ok I bought this iPhone now I can't activate it I am desipointed . I need this unlock now they say that there is no unlock code for this phone .pls if u are buying an iPhone make sure it is unlock this was s wast of my time and money. I am KENDAL HANNA a dissatisfied customer,1
"Brand new in sealed box, as promised. Minor complaint -- this must be from a foreign market, because the charger and brick in the box is not a US plug. Seller included a US plug in the amazon box, but its a generic charging cable and brick, not apple. Otherwise, very happy with the product.",5
Great phone! I've had the 4 and the 4s and the 5s is amazing! So slim and fast and there is definitely a BIG difference in the phone compared to the 4/4s. Absolutely love apple and iOS 7. And I'm in love with the gold color!,5
"I have sold my Apple iPhone 5s 16GB, as I needed an UNBLOCKED unit, and although I thought I was bying an unblocked version, it turned out that I wasn't. I have since acquired the same machine, here in South Africa, and it is the best thing that I have ever acquired!!!!",1
this phone has disabled me more times than i can say in the short time i have had it. if i could return this phone i would..very unhappy w this phone...,2

"A friend asked me to order this item, the phone came with no charger, screen corners are darker than usual, ICCID says unknown and I paid $189 for this. I want my money back ASAP, pleassse somebody.",1
This phone works great at first I thought it was defective because it would not turn on but I found out that the lock switch was on which would not let the phone charge or turn on after I turned that off the phone works like brand new great deal for the price,5
The phone came in alright condition. It has scratches and dings on. BUT it does not come with a SIM and it is not clearly noted on the description. Make sure you have a SIM because it's a huge pain to get one! Two to three weeks shipping for me.,3
"Phone came in the mail dead with a scratch on the screen. Once I charged it up and tried it out, multiple letters on the keyboard did not work. To top it off, after one day of owning this ""good conditioned"" iPhone, the screen went completely bizarre. Terrible seller.",1
excellent condition and working perfect. Don't do an upgrade from your carrier to get a phone because it went bad. I'm happy with this and I'm not in another 2 yr contract with AT&T,5
This phone came in great shape. No visible scratches at all. We had no problems at all getting Sprint service added. And so far no problems and works great. So glad we bought this phone at such a great price.,5
"the phone speakers broke after a month and a half. do not buy from them. they are a 3rd party who ""fixes"" phones with tape to hold parts together. buying from them was the biggest mistake of my life. i thought they were posing as apple and sold me a crapy phone. THEY ARE FAKE!!!! DO NOT TRUST THEM!!!!",1
I really really LOOVVEEE this iPhone ! 😍😍 thank you soooooooooooooooo much ! I couldn't ask for Better . and for a cheap price ? this is excellent . it looks brand new but you have to buy your own charger and box AND headphones but the phone is still worth it ! make sure you charge the phone before you deliver it though . :/,5

Was doing really good. Now this week my screens are freezing up i have to push home button and turn back on to get messages or my square. sometimes freezes up while i am using it. is a pain to use square to collect money for my sales and turn off and on couple of times to complete a transaction.,3

Very disapionted as I'm in Australia and the fone can't be used I understood fone locked for sprint but would axept overseas sim for use out side the states stuck with a fone that the carriers won't unlock,1
before ordering the iphone 5s i was like man whats the point of touch id it sounds like a stupid gimmick. in reality its a great tool for phone security because people don't see you put in your password. I also like that it's faster to log into my phone.,5
"I've had this phone for about two months now and I absolutely love it! It's a great phone. One problem though, the brightness sometimes changes by itself even with auto-brightness turned off. Other than that, it's a great phone.",5
"Was advertised as a refurbished phone. But it was used not refurbished. Refurbished almost always have a new shell. But are to definitely be fully tested. More rigorous testing than new products. However, this phone was scratched up. And microphone is not working at 100%. As others he me as muffled.",2
"This was an amazing upgrade for us since we were still using a 3Gs. I would prefer a more solid battery, and I wish that voice control/siri could function w/o internet access but other than that; it's a good product at this price point.",4

"It looked good, but the battery is shot and it won't charge very fast. Now we are stuck. That was all her Christmas money. Don't buy used! Or refurbished...it took an hour and a half in the Sprint store to get all the updates loaded.",2
I love the form factor. Just the right size for my needs. The 6 was too large for someone who usually keeps the phone in his pocket. The extra memory means I'll never run out of room for apps and pics. Plenty fast even with the new OS.,5
"Shipped perfectly. Using flawlessly for months on end. Would suggest buying a SIM card with it unless you live close to a Spring store, I had to make three trips to get it working properly. However, that isn't the buyer's fault, Sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10",5

"I'm writing this review after using the phone over a year. It was easy to hook up w sprint right out of the box, and has been working well for me since Dec 2015. I can upgrade to a new phone now but haven't because there is no need -this refurbished phone still functions without noticeable hiccups.",5
Item was ok.WARNING: IT does not come with a SIM card. Must have a SIM card from the carrier to be able to activate/ use it. Had to order a nano SIM card to make it work (still waiting on those to be delivered),2

I just got my new iphone 5s Today it came in the iPhone 5s gold box and looked brand new! Everything is in tact no scratches or any screen problems at all! Shipping also came very early. My predicted shipping was 5-110 days after my purchase and it came two days from after i put my order in!,5
Had the phone for 6 months and had no problem. So much faster than any android I ever had the music thing is annoying but you get used to downloading songs of iTunes lol.,5

It was a nice and brand new phone but it wasn't factory unlocked so I had a hard time getting it to work. I had to call 3 different companies and none could provide me with an unlock code so I had to make the decision to send this phone back and settle for a different phone that is unlocked.,2
Ordered this phone thinking it was a sprint phone.. I went to activate it on the sprint network and it isn't actually a sprint phone.. Very frustrated.,1
The phone has been to the AT&T store twice and help from Apple Support . It may have serious problems. Not sure iif I should send it back or give it more time.,2
"Good price. Phone is immaculate. Fast delivery. No issues. Love the phone, much better than the 5c I had. Touch ID is a nice feature. Wonderful camera.",5
"Great, connection is lost at times but maybe the connection is due to ATT. Didn't come with charger like supposed to. But works great. Came charged. Almost new.",4
"i could not insert a nano sim chip then i do not know if works. I noticed that if you buy the 64 GB from the apple store for Tmobile is cheaper than this one, also is unlocked. I didn't know about that.",3
"this phone was in great shape when I got it and was exactly as they said! I was worried about it being broken or defective, but the phone is working great and I have absolutely no problems :)",5
"This item came very fast. I was disappointed when they told me it will arrive in a week, but so happy and overwhelmed when it arrived in two days without PRIME connection. The iPhone works perfectly and don't regret purchasing. Best thing I've bought!",5
"The score I am hit to customer service, a staff name Racquel,I buy this phone in a month ago, because of some reasons lead to the phone I haven't use!Finally I reflect the problem to think name is Racquel staff, he is very careful, and have the patience to help me to solve this problem!",5
"When this phone arrived, it either wasn't unlocked or wasn't an ATT compatible phone which is what we supposedly bought. It won't activate on our line which makes it basically pointless.",1
The sound did not work properly which makes it hard if you can't hear text messages or people when you answer the phone. First and foremost it must work as a phone. Customer service was great at facilitating returns but it would have been nice to double check everything before shipping things out.,1
"I bought it as new but when i get it today and opened it it was used and broken, i did not activated it yet going to do it tomorrow hope it will work i am very upset.",1
"Phone was in excellent condition. The price and the quality of the device are unparalleled to any other phone product on Amazon. I would not only reuse this service if needed, but would recommend to anyone that asked.",5
"Came with one charging cable, and the phone. No box or anything, but I don't need any more apple boxes on my shelves. I saved a lot of money, and would buy from these fellas and gals again..",5
The phone they sent me was manufactured for sale in Japan (or another similar country) and thus I cannot shut off the camera shutter sound. It's very annoying.,2
"This phone was horrible. Within a few months, it was completely useless. It glitches out all the time, I couldn't even write a text message. Huge waste of money.",1
This phone is the right size and as is fast!! It was purchased for my son's birthday. He is happy with this phone. My son prefers the smaller phones and this works for him as some larger ones like the iPhone 6 and 7 are too big for his taste.,5
"Works great! Does not uncles SIM card but you can purchase one online or through a phone call. Perfect screen. Very minimal marks on the back, but if you use a case it looks brand new.",5
"This Iphone product didn't meet my expectations at all. There were many damages around the phone casing, and the main speaker, on the front screen, wasn't working properly. Also the phone over-heats; not to mention the battery life drains faster than usual.",1
My son does not get the best of signal when at home or in small town areas. But overall he seems to enjoy this phone and has no other complaint. Package came as promised and delivered late due to a mix up but was refunded the shipment before phone arrived. Overall very satisfied,4
This phone is absolutely amazing & this is the first iPhone I've ever had :). The battery is better than Android because I only need to charge it every 2 days instead of everyday. It's very well designed & I'll stick with Apple for a very long time haha.,3
I'am very satisfied with purchasing my new phone. Everything described was exactly true about the conditions of the phone which looks practically new. I would reccomend anyone to get their phone with them :),5
So far this phone has been exactly what I wanted it for! It was nice to get an Iphone for a lower price and not have to shell out the big bucks!A few times the phone has had some glitches but it worked after restarting it. But overall what I wanted!!,4
Phone works and was in really good condition the only reason I didnt give 5 stars is because I ordered a silver iphone and recieved the space grey iphone.,4
Terrible! It is a Sprint phone and they couldn't turn it on. I tried to return it but never heard back from the seller. Then I tried to unlock it and have T-Mobile turn it on. They couldn't do it either. This was a waste of my money!!!!,1
Works and arrived as advertised. I feel the the motherboard was scrapped from a 4s because it shows up on AT&T and iTunes as a 4s. I crossed-checked the serial number through Apple and it says it is a 5s so the controlling component must have been from a 4s. Other than that I'm happy with the purchase.,4
"One of three phones I bought this month from Amazon third-party because of ""drowned"" phones. This was one was as described (or better). Shipping was very fast! Very satisfied so far!",5
"After some issues, not by the seller, the Item was as described. It's perfect! And they gave me a car charger and two phones cases for the mishap. Thank you!",5
"this is a great phone! It arrived in perfect, new condition. No SIM card, but Apple took care of that quickly and with no charge. It arrived quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas",5
"Not sure about a used phone in this price range, but very happy with the cost and it is much better condition than expected. Already past the 30-days and no problems. Works great. I will buy more phones like this.",5
"Phone does not say percentage by the battery, caused me problems when I was restoring it. Charger is FAKE. Not pleased because of that. The phone is also causing me problems with music. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate the phone a 6.",3
"I have had some erratic incidents that I had not had with my previous 5s. Eventually they went away, but it has caused me to question the product or the source a bit.",3
"As far as the iPhone goes I like it. As far as this particular one, the screen is sometimes unresponsive requiring a restart. Not cool.update. downgrading to one star. it quit on me last night. it is still on, but the screen wont come on. am having to return it and I cant even wipe it before i do. not cool.",1
"the phone speakers broke after a month and a half. do not buy from them. they are a 3rd party who ""fixes"" phones with tape to hold parts together. buying from them was the biggest mistake of my life. i thought they were posing as apple and sold me a crapy phone. THEY ARE FAKE!!!! DO NOT TRUST THEM!!!!",1
I really really LOOVVEEE this iPhone ! 😍😍 thank you soooooooooooooooo much ! I couldn't ask for Better . and for a cheap price ? this is excellent . it looks brand new but you have to buy your own charger and box AND headphones but the phone is still worth it ! make sure you charge the phone before you deliver it though . :/,5
"I love my phone and it is in great condition but it is an Iphone 5 not a 5S and I payed for a 5S not a 5. The shipping and the quality of the phone was great, but I wanted a 5S.",2
"Phone I got was in decent visual condition. However, battery does not last with more than 1 hour of use. Also, after 3 days the speaker stopped working. Buyer beware, these are junk refurbished phones.",1
"The phone I got was highly used, many dinks on the side. the front touch screen was replaced with after market junk. The touch screen stopped working after two weeks. The wifi and LTE data also slowed to a crawl. I don't recommend a used iPhone.",1
This phone works great at first I thought it was defective because it would not turn on but I found out that the lock switch was on which would not let the phone charge or turn on after I turned that off the phone works like brand new great deal for the price,5
The phone came in alright condition. It has scratches and dings on. BUT it does not come with a SIM and it is not clearly noted on the description. Make sure you have a SIM because it's a huge pain to get one! Two to three weeks shipping for me.,3
"A friend asked me to order this item, the phone came with no charger, screen corners are darker than usual, ICCID says unknown and I paid $189 for this. I want my money back ASAP, pleassse somebody.",1
"It's really good! But sometimes, it doesn't find good signal! I don't know why... If it's the cellphone, or if it's the carrier! The product is amazing, what I had found",4
We are very satisfied with our purchase. The dealer answered questions promptly and communicated with professionalism. would definitely recommend people purchase from this site and this dealer. will be purchasing again soon. Product exceeded my expectations. very satisfied.,5
currently very very pleased with this phone!! i bought it refurbished and it is like brand new. i have had no problems so far and hope i don't have to encounter any.,5
"Was advertised as a refurbished phone. But it was used not refurbished. Refurbished almost always have a new shell. But are to definitely be fully tested. More rigorous testing than new products. However, this phone was scratched up. And microphone is not working at 100%. As others he me as muffled.",2
"This was an amazing upgrade for us since we were still using a 3Gs. I would prefer a more solid battery, and I wish that voice control/siri could function w/o internet access but other than that; it's a good product at this price point.",4
I was skeptical about ordering a used iPhone but I am thrilled with the phone I received. It is in perfect condition and exactly as advertised. Not a flaw on it that I can see. The SIM card from my old phone was too big. I took it to an ATT store and they cut it to fit. No charge. My phone was working the same day I received it.,5
I really like the iphone 5S. It is my first and only smart phone so I can't judge it according to other makes. The learning curve is terrible an Apple does't tell you much about using it even starting. They assume you know the basics of smart phones apparently. Amazon Warehouse were excellent to do business with.,5
The description said never been out of the box when I got it there was NO box NO booklet NO charger. besides that I love the phone no scratches no nothing.,3
This phone has worked great for me for two years now. I also hate cases and have dropped it a thousand times preparing myself for the worst when I pick it up and it's still in great condition.,5
The product came in less than a week. It was in perfect condition and was as described. I was able to activate the phone immediately with no issues what so ever.,5
I was a little skeptical at first but once I received the phone and activated I was incredibly happy with what I bought I recommend this seller to anybody looking to buy an iPhone on amazon. 5 start quality for sure,5
"When I got my iPhone it was in new condition, but the iPhone was defective, the phone would do a blue screen loop, and then put itself into recovery mode every single night, when I went to go recover it, halfway it would fail. Thankfully the iPhone had the 1 year warranty still I'm effect, so I brought it to the apple store and got a new iPhone.",5
Phone sold as new was not had been activated 6 months early and we could not activate through apple or iTunes. Theregote I feel time snd money wasted.,1
Bought the new iphone to try it so far so good. It really isnt TOO GREAT i have been using other phones like the Xperia Z2 although Iphone 5S has some cool new features like the fingerprint scanner it isnt really something that changes the game.... It is the kind of features that u use the first time u buy the phone and then forget about,3
"Amazing phone. I woke up the next morning after using the phone, I named her Siri; and she made me coffee. I come home from work and all my clothes are folded and put away nicely. What an amazing phone the 5S is. The only problem is we can't take a shower together, something about the water Siri doesn't like. I love my 5S. <3",5
Very disapionted as I'm in Australia and the fone can't be used I understood fone locked for sprint but would axept overseas sim for use out side the states stuck with a fone that the carriers won't unlock,1
"The phone did not come unlocked as advertised. When the package was delivered, it was stated in the bill that was locked onto the AT&T Network, not Factory Unlocked as advertised.",3
I was hoping this wouldn't be a crApple product but after less than 2 months of use the phone shuts off randomly & as of lately refusing to boot up for hours.This is absolutely disgusting.,1
I ordered another IPhone before this one & was given one with scratches & the lock screen did not work. This one came as explained in the bio! Works great came in mint condition I love my IPhone!,5
"I needed to recieve this by Christmas as a gift for my boyfriend and did! The seller has great communication via email, and inturn was able to provide ideal customer service. The product is working great and my boyfriend had the best christmas ever. Thank you!",5
"I bought this iphone the other day and I am absolutely in love. Everything came as described. I had the iphone 4s prior to this phone and was inneed of a upgrade, Im very satisfied with the iphone 5s, battery lasts much longer and the camera is way better on this phone. I recommend people to order this phone from here, it really is worth it!",5
Product is great and meet my expatations of a telephone what is needed to experience the modern world. Maybe wen ordered from Europe the adapter can be fit to match the european electricity outlets.Regards Peter,5
"I had the iPhone 4S before and was waiting to upgrade to a newer version but didn't really see the need with the iPhone 5, I'm so glad I waited because I'm in love with my new phone. It came just as it was described and the seller communicated with me in reguards to any questions I had, I would deffenately buy from this seller again in the future.",5
Overall a nice little phone though the antennae seems a little week to me. I was up in the mountains near my home and my sons cheap go phone had better reception. Both phones are AT&T...,4
"Came as claimed. Near flawless condition... I couldn't find anything wrong with it if I tried. Only thing is it came with a black back piece of aluminum... No apple logo or and writing, at all. But it grew on me its very sleek. Phone operates as expected and is lightning fast. I would suggest to anyone.",5
"this item arrived perfectly fine, on time and it looked great on the outside but the part where it charges the phone was old, moldy and burnt, and there is no way to fix it. I wasted $250.",1
"It looked good, but the battery is shot and it won't charge very fast. Now we are stuck. That was all her Christmas money. Don't buy used! Or refurbished...it took an hour and a half in the Sprint store to get all the updates loaded.",2
I love the form factor. Just the right size for my needs. The 6 was too large for someone who usually keeps the phone in his pocket. The extra memory means I'll never run out of room for apps and pics. Plenty fast even with the new OS.,5
It was great. Has worked well. but I would like to kindly request for the name that was attached to the sprint account. It is equested for the unlocking of the device. Please contact on my email ubong21@gmail.com,4
I purchased a iPhone5s and the description said it was unlocked. At&t says it is not unlocked and will not release the phone to consumer cellular. I will be returning the phone today and looking to purchase somewhere else.,1
"Good phone performs like it should.but calls have static sometimes but it goes away but phone was in awesome condition , very happy I would recommend. Fast shipping too I needed the phone.",5
phone did not work properly. we had to take it to ATT store. the #1 button would not work on keyboard. they had to replace the glass $110. now it works fine. pretty disappointing. It was shipped to my daughter in college and there was no time to send it back and get another one.,1
"My apologies - I didn't know that my phone is synced with my hearing aids - and, therefore, ""blue tooth"" is on all the time. So, that is causing the battery to run down faster than I'm used to. The phone is just fine and the vendor was most cooperative.",4
"I bought this Iphone because I wanted to use it in Mexico but it doesn't work, on the website description said that It just works in US just with sprint but in others countries it would work totally fine like Mexico, so I would like to return it.",1
"Arrived early and came as described (minor imperfections on back surface). My sister lost her previous sprint iPhone & this is for her birthday! Hopefully, easy set-up with sprint...",4
I purchased this phone and had contact with seller to make sure it's a att phone. They said yes. Well went to att and it's not an att phone. They checked it and it will not accept simple card from att.,1
Phone looks great does as expected. Sadly the battery is useless. After fully charging it still dies within two hours. Now that should have been stated in the sale listing too. Now off to buy a battery!!! I don't like dishonesty or failure to disclose. especially when it comes to this sort of item.,2
I wish I could give this 0 stars.The phone is dirty and cracked up. It looks like its been through hell and back.This phone has water damage and the screen is blur.I demand a refund this is going back.,1
I ordered the phone on the Monday night (the night I broke my phone and couldn't use it) and it arrived on Friday. The phone looks great and works well. Thank you for your swift service and delivery.,5
"Got this for my daughter for her birthday, was listed as good condition but it was practically brand new just didn't have a box. Super fast shipping! Thank you",5
The home button made a clicking sound every time i pressed it and it took a fall and the back camera went out i pulled it apart fixed but forgot to put something on it and then it wouldnt turn on the motherboard went but that was my fault really,3
"Arrived on time, quick shipment! The phone arrived in its original box & factory sealed by Apple. Received my order in less than 24 hours. Plus I got it for a great price! Highly recommended!",5
I am sorry I never wrote a review for you when you I purchased this. Phone was exactly as described and works great. We some issues getting it set up because it was still on the buyers apple account. The buyer worked fast on getting it removed and we were able to add to our provider within two days. Thank You!,5
before ordering the iphone 5s i was like man whats the point of touch id it sounds like a stupid gimmick. in reality its a great tool for phone security because people don't see you put in your password. I also like that it's faster to log into my phone.,5
"I've had this phone for about two months now and I absolutely love it! It's a great phone. One problem though, the brightness sometimes changes by itself even with auto-brightness turned off. Other than that, it's a great phone.",5
"The product is marked as like new, but the mobilephone i received screen scratches.And the top of the screen will be dented with a little strength,use my hand.",3
My new iphone 5s arrived ahead of schedule. My iphone 5s arrived in very good condition without any incidents. The price was just right.Now I can purchase my iwatch. Thanks James Thom,5
"I did not realize that the phone was not unlocked and made ​​the mistake to buy it for the Sprint company. I live in Argentina , and wanted to know if you know any way to unlock it or I can send some code to do it?",4
"Bought this phone to replace 4S, but have had nothing but trouble. The camera only works toward the texter, not out the back the right way. My I tunes and computer do not recognize it at all. How do I get a refund?",1
"The phone does not hold a charge for over 3 hours, the auto rotate function does not work, the compass does not funtion. To sum it up, if I were to have a second chance I would NOT buy a used phone here.",1
This phone was in great condition I have had it for about a month now and I haven't had any problems it was a great purchase great price all around great,5
It arrived sealed in the box phone works and looks great the Apple iPhone 5s is extremely easy to use I actually purchased it for my twelve year old daughter and she has not put it down it was a great gift for her,5
The phone has been to the AT&T store twice and help from Apple Support . It may have serious problems. Not sure iif I should send it back or give it more time.,2
"Good price. Phone is immaculate. Fast delivery. No issues. Love the phone, much better than the 5c I had. Touch ID is a nice feature. Wonderful camera.",5
"Great, connection is lost at times but maybe the connection is due to ATT. Didn't come with charger like supposed to. But works great. Came charged. Almost new.",4
"Very good used iphone 5s. Product came exactly as described in product details. Good batter life, cosmetic condition. And shipping was fast after an initial wait period.",5
Its permanently locked to Sprint and I am travelling to a different country. Now I am not able to use it as its locked.This information was missing during the time of purchase.,1
"Appearance of the phone was perfect, unfortunately after 93 days of ownership the video blew out. There was no physical damage to the phone, it just stopped functioning and does not appear repairable.",1
"No complaints, people should read and understand what they going to buy before they start complaining, got my phone in very good condition, for the price and very honest services..",5
Overall it's a good productBut I did see some minor blemishes such as scratches also the screen was popped out in one corner but the technology was fine,3
"Phone is a bit more quirky than I'd hoped, touchscreen seems to lose letters and motions here and there, but I think that's just iOS8 being weird, hopefully it'll get better with the next update.",4
"Sprint refused to activate this phone on a pre-paid plan. We ended up returning it. The phone itself appeared unused and in the original box. However, it did not have the Apple factory seal on the box so was apparently not ""new"".",2
I purchased this phone from the seller and when I received it I was unable to use it. I invested alot of time and money trying to fix it and couldn't. The seller would not communicate with me about the phone when I was trying to fix it so it was returned to seller. My experience with this product was very stressful to say the least.,1
"The item is exactly as it was described and shipping was as expected, by far the best thing I have bought on Amazon. The price was a lot but it's bc it's practically brand new, but it was totally worth all the money I spent on ift, I love it!!",5
I just got my new iphone 5s Today it came in the iPhone 5s gold box and looked brand new! Everything is in tact no scratches or any screen problems at all! Shipping also came very early. My predicted shipping was 5-110 days after my purchase and it came two days from after i put my order in!,5
Had the phone for 6 months and had no problem. So much faster than any android I ever had the music thing is annoying but you get used to downloading songs of iTunes lol.,5
Shh .. This is a Christmas Gift from Santa Clause! This phone arrived before the due date & get this .. It came with EXTRAS that wasn't even mentioned or known! I was exstatic when I opened the package & saw everything so I definitely know my recipient of this gift will be too!!!,5
"This phone has been exactly what I expected and wanted. Moreover, the seller was fantastic, did a great job of transferring the phone, packing and shipping securely and promptly.",5
"My wife's iPhone 4 died and she wanted a new one, but didn't want to commit to another 2-year contract. I bought this new from Amazon for $250 less than what Sprint would charge me.",5
IT was not totally fine. It has a rattle like the insides don't quite fit tightly. I am having some issues with it not responding to internet quickly. But this does not happen all the time.,3
"I ordered this phone expecting a 5s. Imagine my shock when I opened the box to find a 5 in there. The phone is in good condition, but WAS NOT AS LISTED!",1
Ordered this as a gift for my daughter's 17th birthday and so far she's in love with it. Everything was as described and it even arrived earlier than expected!,5
Ok I bought this iPhone now I can't activate it I am desipointed . I need this unlock now they say that there is no unlock code for this phone .pls if u are buying an iPhone make sure it is unlock this was s wast of my time and money. I am KENDAL HANNA a dissatisfied customer,1
"Brand new in sealed box, as promised. Minor complaint -- this must be from a foreign market, because the charger and brick in the box is not a US plug. Seller included a US plug in the amazon box, but its a generic charging cable and brick, not apple. Otherwise, very happy with the product.",5
"I was hesitant about purchasing this phone but I'm glad I did! The phone got here 1 day earlier than I expected, it looks almost new, everything works great, and it came with the charging cables! Very happy with my purchase!",5
"It got here fast, order got here in 2 days standard shipping. I love it, looks new came in IPhone box with ear buds, and charger. Could not have ask for anything better. Will recommend to everybody. Thanks for the phone!",5
I have not even had this phone for a month and now the home button does not work!! Have not dropped it I don't know why it just stopped working from one day to the next very disappointed!! Also the screen on the side looks like it is about to pop out any minute!!,1
"Recently purchased this iPhone about 1 month or 2 months ago, sometimes it decides not to charge and then screen frezzes. its a ""NEW"" iPhone but its giving me problems..",3
It was a nice and brand new phone but it wasn't factory unlocked so I had a hard time getting it to work. I had to call 3 different companies and none could provide me with an unlock code so I had to make the decision to send this phone back and settle for a different phone that is unlocked.,2
Ordered this phone thinking it was a sprint phone.. I went to activate it on the sprint network and it isn't actually a sprint phone.. Very frustrated.,1
this phone has disabled me more times than i can say in the short time i have had it. if i could return this phone i would..very unhappy w this phone...,2
"Phone works fine, but went through the run around to get a SIM card. NO...the phone doesn't come with one. Luckily, I was able to get one from Apple because Sprint doesn't have them to give to customers.",3
"Phone was still owned by previous owner and his/her name wasn't clear from at&t, therefore have trouble activating the phone.Update: Resolve when speak with at&t representative, showing them the receipt that I purchase this phone.",1
"I'm writing this review after using the phone over a year. It was easy to hook up w sprint right out of the box, and has been working well for me since Dec 2015. I can upgrade to a new phone now but haven't because there is no need -this refurbished phone still functions without noticeable hiccups.",5
Item was ok.WARNING: IT does not come with a SIM card. Must have a SIM card from the carrier to be able to activate/ use it. Had to order a nano SIM card to make it work (still waiting on those to be delivered),2
"I didn't read all description, so I thought that the product was available for all phone carriers. When I wanted to activate with other carrier and I couldn't do that, I reread the complete description and understood which was my problem.",4
"I was scared to buy a phone online because I didn't want it to be broken, but I'm so happy this phone is perfect. Works great no scratches. Very friendly, buy their stuff!",5
"i could not insert a nano sim chip then i do not know if works. I noticed that if you buy the 64 GB from the apple store for Tmobile is cheaper than this one, also is unlocked. I didn't know about that.",3
"Very undone. Speaker was blown, front facing had to replaced as well as the battery after I found out it was an aftermarketed replacement that was too thick for the facing to seat correctly. Overall spent over $200 to have it in basic standings",1
There wasn't a SIMS card with it. Which my have been my fault for not double checking out reading through everything. I'm not sure they advertised no SIM card though. But it was in great shape and exactly what I was looking for. No scratches or problems either. Also the charger they sent me didn't work.,3
"the phone works great, but i did have to get the power cord replaced shortly after receiving it. but the apple store gave it to me for free because it was still under warrenty",4
"Phone came in the mail dead with a scratch on the screen. Once I charged it up and tried it out, multiple letters on the keyboard did not work. To top it off, after one day of owning this ""good conditioned"" iPhone, the screen went completely bizarre. Terrible seller.",1
excellent condition and working perfect. Don't do an upgrade from your carrier to get a phone because it went bad. I'm happy with this and I'm not in another 2 yr contract with AT&T,5
This phone came in great shape. No visible scratches at all. We had no problems at all getting Sprint service added. And so far no problems and works great. So glad we bought this phone at such a great price.,5
This is a great phone. iPhone 5S is a great phone. Can do many things. Like multi-tasking is great. The #5 version is a stronger and very popular to work. The pictures are the most easiest for a touch phone. And much faster then the iPhone 4. Try it I think you would like it. I recently bought this for a friend of mine. And she thinks its great.,5
bought this used from amazon. was worried about it not working or missing a cable but it came with new everything except an apple box. sure beats buying a new one for close to $1000. works great and its new to me.,5
"Mine works perfectly! I have yet to find any scratches on the screen, so it's in great condition! Plus, I have over 2500 songs and tons of apps on my phone now and I still have about 38 GB of free space! I am EXTREMELY pleased!",5
Awesome Used Product.. No Flaw except some hazy look on screen when its screen is off.. Outer body dont have a single scratch and phone is running without any issue,4
"I love it. I never had an iPhone before and I am so glad I bought this one. It is just like new and I have seen others like this on ""sale"" for over $500.00 so I got a great deal.",5
Worst thing ever..... Ordered the home thinking I was gonna be able to use it.... And turns out it was for the wrong carrier as described in the ad. I was very upset... This is the first time something like this has ever happened.,1
"This was a upgrade from the 5c. The only issue i had was that this phone did not come with a SIM card, but the nice guy i called at ATT told me what to do, and this phone works like a charm! i am SO happy!The phone was in excellent shape, one minor blemish that is easily ignored (or covered with a sparkly phone case).",5
This is the second time I've bought an iPhone online. I wish I'd known about this company the first time around. The phone is exactly as it was described! It works and looks perfect! Would absolutely buy from them again! Thank you so much!,5
The phone is beautiful. However i only had a couple of problems with it. The top left corner is glitchy and there is a red dot on the lcd display when turned on. Other than that the phone is perfect. I would buy from this seller again.,3
"Phone arrived and appeared new and in a Sprint iphone box. However, when brought to the Sprint store to activate they advised that it was not a Sprint phone and they would be unable to activate it for service.",1
Ordered three of these phones and non of them would connect to Sprint's network. Sprint told me that they were incompatible with their system. They were also not new phones and were refurbished.,1
Great phone! I've had the 4 and the 4s and the 5s is amazing! So slim and fast and there is definitely a BIG difference in the phone compared to the 4/4s. Absolutely love apple and iOS 7. And I'm in love with the gold color!,5
"I have sold my Apple iPhone 5s 16GB, as I needed an UNBLOCKED unit, and although I thought I was bying an unblocked version, it turned out that I wasn't. I have since acquired the same machine, here in South Africa, and it is the best thing that I have ever acquired!!!!",1
"The phone was shipped quickly, however I received the iPhone 5 instead of the 5s model that the title and description state it is. Needed a new phone as soon as possible so I didn't return the item. It works great and looked brand new. I'm just disappointed I didn't get what I thought I was paying for.",3
"Shipped perfectly. Using flawlessly for months on end. Would suggest buying a SIM card with it unless you live close to a Spring store, I had to make three trips to get it working properly. However, that isn't the buyer's fault, Sprint just has a s***ty way to do everything. 10/10",5
I was very excited to receive the phone in a short amount of time and to see it was basically brand new and had some charge in it so I could activate it right away! I was also very happy that it came with not 1 but 2 chargers!,5
I purchased the phone used for $350 and have been using it for the past month. I recommend the phone at this price point.Pros:Good cameraTouch ID is accurate and convenientGood 4 inch sizeFast processorPurchased 1 year used and it still works wellIt runs iOS 8.1Cons:Home button works but has a small clicking sound.No Apple pay/ NFC,5
It was unblocked and never been unblocked. Charger was so dirty and disgusting! I could not finalize talk to seller who promised to unlock the phone but never did,1
"this is a great phone! It arrived in perfect, new condition. No SIM card, but Apple took care of that quickly and with no charge. It arrived quickly and in plenty of time for Christmas",5
Was doing really good. Now this week my screens are freezing up i have to push home button and turn back on to get messages or my square. sometimes freezes up while i am using it. is a pain to use square to collect money for my sales and turn off and on couple of times to complete a transaction.,3
"Paid almost $20 extra for overnight shipping, phone came 4 days later, plugged in the charger n it started smoking. Phone it's self was as advertised and works fine just wish it was a better overall experience.",3
"Came as advertised, put in the SIM Card, registered phone with provider, syncd with ITunes and was up in no time at all. Was a new locked phone for Sprint and couldn't have worked any better. Quick delivery, excellent product and I couldn't be happier.",5
"Didn't realize how small the screen was...much smaller than my LG which got damaged. I don't like the sound on this. I am unable to put my vm's on speaker so can barely hear my messages, even with the volume at max. The one thing I do like is it since with all my other Apple devices.",3
I should've upgraded ages ago but was too cheap. So glad I can finally get rid of my 4s and be up to speed with the rest of the world! The 5s is so much faster and more responsive. The cable that came with my phone stopped working after just a couple weeks but I replaced it with an Amazon cable and we are good to go.,5
I absolutely love this phone. Being an 17 year old I had worried about buying an iPhone on Amazon for such a low price of 199$ but this phone is absolutely amazing and I totally recommend you buying this phone! It came earlier than expected and came with a charger.,5
Hey Amazon I purchased this iPhone and it's not working..I live in Trinidad and it's showing an outstanding balance T-mobile.I need assistance from u all .,1
Phone had a couple of scratches in the back & at the bottom around the charging port. Aside from that the phone has been functioning perfectly & I am satisfied for the time being.,4
Totally unsatisfied with the product.It has scratches at bottom and on screen which was not mentioned in product description.I want to present it as gift to my girlfriend but I'm disappointed by seeing this product.I lost my money by purchasing this unworthy product and lost my trust on this site for false description & products supplying.,1
I bought the phone for my son. The seller sent the phone with power cord and it was packaged nicely. No damage on body or glass surface. Very pleased and would buy again!,4
"The phone did not turn on plain and simple. This was a birthday gift for my son who was so excited to receive his phone and to our disappointment, it doesn't work.",1
"Bought this refurb a little skeptical because I thought the battery would be toast after sitting for a long time... turned out it works just fine. Way better value than buying one new, works the same. Been using for 3 months no problem.",5
"I was really hoping I would luck out and get a good phone, despite the negative reviews. I have had the phone for two days. The first day seemed fine but now I see that the phone wont last more than 4 hours, even without use. It also randomly shuts down. Very disappointed.",1
"This item is not as advertised. It was to be unlocked GSM or which it is not. It is locked and requires SIM card and is a Verizon locked phone. Yes it is new, but does me no good. I do not recommend buying from this seller.",1
"""Refurbished"", more like ""Take it, it's broken but cheaper!"". Battery is in its worst condition, and there are scratches everywhere. The Touch ID is non-responsive. Bad product.",2
"i dont know what does it mean to look like new but i am sure it should not look like that the screen is obviously scratched and there is a wear on the side, i am not sure how can sell something like that with that price, i returned it, hopefully i will get my money back",1
Hey Amazon I purchased this iPhone and it's not working..I live in Trinidad and it's showing an outstanding balance T-mobile.I need assistance from u all .,1
Phone had a couple of scratches in the back & at the bottom around the charging port. Aside from that the phone has been functioning perfectly & I am satisfied for the time being.,4
"Good phone and in good condition, but recently discovered that this is only an Iphone 5, not a 5s. Also, it didn't come with the stock earbuds, which are expensive. FALSE ADVERTISING.",2
This was advertised as new. Took it to Apple as the battery was depleted after 2 months. They refused to work on it because the battery was third party as were many of the buttons and inner working!! This was not as advertised at all.,1
"This person is a scam artist. I bought my phone, everything works great for a while, then it is reported that the payments are not being made on it and the IMIE is blocked. This person knows exactly what they are doing and they are criminals.",1
"Had to return the phone. After 10 days of the phone, phone became blocked and could not be used. The phone came out of service and couldn't not be used to call or text.",1
"I read a couple of bad reviews, but my experience its been great. I got a brand new IPhone, in a sealed box with all the accessories and works perfectly fine.",5
Serious problems with the phone. Isnt compatible with tmobile but says in the factory settings that the carrier is tmobile. Also isn't unlocked like they claim to be. Don't buy the phone it's just a huge hassle,1
"Probably could've found better prices , also the battery drains fast a few weeks after I bought it, recenty just shut down for no reason when it was at 70% .",3
Don't buy it. Yes the iPhone is brand new and everything but the phone itself is horrible. I wanted to activated on tmobile but had Lots of problems like the phone was not reading the SIM card and when it did it kept turning off which made the screen go blue!! horrible experience.,1
Phone arrived quickly as described and worked great for a week. After a day bouncing between Apple and my carrier Apple replaced the phone for a new one. The new phone lasted a week and I had to make another appointment with Apple and they replaced that phone. Quality control could be better. Has all the bells and whistle to keep my daughter happy.,4
I enjoy the fingerprint addition so when people are nearby I can just touch the home button to unlock my phone without anyone lurking to see me enter my unlock code.,5
Great phone works well with T-Mobile. Game new out-of-the-box in perfect mint condition. It's the right size phone for me I had a Samsung galaxy S3 before that wouldn't fit in my pocket. This phone is lightning fastsyncs with my iTunes automatically can't say enough good things about it. Seller shipped fast no issues,5
I love this phone! I cut my original Sim card that was in my Samsung Galaxy and put it in the new Iphone 5s and it works great.Internet responds super fast and the fingerprint unlock is amazing. Condition is perfect and it came in the original box. I'm very happy with my purchase.,5
"Im loving it....So far it works very good no problems, no damages, scratches or anything. Came on time arrived by the 20th which was a couple days ago. It's all what was described about the iPhone 5s and to say im glad i bought it.",5
"This phone sucks!!😒 Do not waste your money on this product. The first day I got it, it was powering off by itself many times. It always froze. I bought it 4 months ago and now it does not work at all!!! The screen popped out all the time. Even tho it says new it is definitely used! Worst phone I probably ever had !",1
This seller is amazing! I asked about a million questions and they were More than happy to respond to them. When I got the phone I cut my SIM card down to size and it responded immediately! Phone is basically perfect!!,5
"Don't waste your money on this phone. I bought this phone a month ago and I kept getting this blue screen, then it reboots itself over and over again. Doesn't work well with T-Mobile like it said, I tried sending it back but they won't take it back. One month into my iPhone and I'm now looking to buy another phone.",1
Real iphone 5s. Came in factory box sealed up like an apple store would sell it to you. It has some better features than the 4 and is ALOT faster! I like it! I sanded down my old sim card for my 4 and it fit in my 5 (save $10-20 on a sim card at tmobile),5
it crazy if you lunch an app it takes you outcant hear people without headphones and for them you sound farand cant take phonescalls sometimes it impossible would not recomended,1
This was supposed to be new! It's two years old! I was mislead into believing I was buying a new iPhone. Now it's messing up and I went to Apple Store and they told me its two years old and warranty is up! I got ripped of!!!!!!!!!!,1
I bought this for a friend.1. The product arrived very quickly. It didn't take the amount of time that amazon said it would so that's always a plus.2. Minimal damage to the phone. It worked like a charm3. It's STILL working. lol. My friend is horrible with phones and yet he's managed to keep this one in tact.,5
"the back camera stopped working, the phone touch screen stops working and i have to restart the phone to get it to work. The phone is a huge disappointment. Not worth what i paid for it.",1
"Phone was fine at first, but after two weeks it was constantly shutting down. The power button got stuck down. Took the phone to Apple and they said it was toast. I was able to return this phone through Amazon though for a full refund and ended up just buying a new I-Phone 6 from my wireless provider.",1
I am super happy with this vendor. The Iphone came in super fast before it was suposeto and it was almost brand new and it works. It was the best purchase I've made. My son is super happy! Thanks,5
A very good device. My only problem is its size. It is heavy in a shirt pocket and inconvenient in hip pocket of a trouser. It slips out very easily from a pocket. I have lost it already 3 times in the last six months but fortunately each time I could find it.,4
Just got my iPhone in the mail thisy 3rd day using it and everything I just like a brand new iPhone 5s no regrets here for the price I got it...... so far.,5
"Perfect perfect perfect! My phone came right on time. I got it and it was like new just as he said. He also sent a charger and a cute pink otter box which was great, because I didn't have to go out and buy one. Thanks!!",5
"i really like the iphone 5s, i can reach everything on the screen with my thumb. I am wondering about the future of Apple since the death of Steve Jobs though. They are involved with Dr Dre now and I heard they are going to make bigger phones, something Steve Jobs was against. Guess we will see.",5
This person selling this item is a liar .. I asked specifically if this unit is for t mobile. The sell told me yes.. I put a tmobile SIM card in this phone that was sent to me but it did not read because the Carrier was sent to sprint,1
"As of November 2015 this phones memory is just about full. 16 GB is simply NOT enough space....and I'm not a big ""apps"" person, but I do like to save my pictures. Otherwise I have no complaints.",4
"I just received this ""unlocked"" iphone 5s two days ago and was happy until I but I tried to put my sim card in. No service so I called my carrier T-Mobile and oh guess what the phone has a carrier lock on it with guess who T-Mobile. Needless to say I'm pissed and without a phone or money and have yet to get a reply or a refund. ZERO STARS!!!",1
"This phone is okay. My son purchased it, he didn't realize how little storage there is. He is constantly deleting nearly all apps and photos to make the phone operable.",3
"Phone was in perfect condition when I got it, everything was fine, until I put the SIM in. Phone was blocked on my network and was reported as stolen. Needless to say, I am NOT happy with this outcome.",1
Great item! Received it a day earlier than expected but works great! Good condition except for stickers on back! Other than that great deal! I reccomend!,5
"It all came in a sealed box, the phone was new and works great. My only problem was that the part that connects to the wall to charge doesn't work too well so I had to use a different connector.",5
"Great customer service! I love my new phone! And the best part is I got it from a really good price! Other places were charging me almost 1,000 for this phone but I got it here for 600. I'm very pleased. Thank you.",5
"This is a very good iphone model. There is a problem that hopefully gets resolved later. If you accidentally push the bottom center button to long, it goes into voice over mode that is difficult to get out of!",4
Great Phone!!! Great phone to have in our system. This phone is also feel like is one of our part in our body system. I really enjoy this phone. Without this phone I feel like handicapped.,5
"Good phone and in good condition, but recently discovered that this is only an Iphone 5, not a 5s. Also, it didn't come with the stock earbuds, which are expensive. FALSE ADVERTISING.",2

My battery does not last longer than 3 hours and there is something wrong with the circuitry inside the phone. I took it into an apple store and the apple tech informed me that my battery had officially failed and I would have to replace the phone.,1
"I'm guessing this is one of the Japanese ones because I can't just use it on wifi without a SIM card, JUST TO SEE IF IT WORKS IN EVERY WAY!!! Can't afford a SIM card right now, I will change my review when I get a SIM and check it out. I don't even know if I got the 32 gig for that matter.",1
"Im so dissapointed on my order in amazon, when i open my iphone 5s unfortunately my phone wont activate. I call the apple support they said that the reason why my phone wont activate due to some deffect on hardware because they try to restore the phone wont work...And they said that the phone is not anymore warranty of apple.",4

I got this so fast…..It is everything I wanted…it was easy to set up! I would recommend this to people who have had trouble with cell phones….it's a pleasure having a nice one!,5
This phone is a present to my nephew who lives overseas. It said it was unlocked. My sister said it is locked and impossible to use. I don't know what to do.,1
"The way it was delivered was a bit less than desirable but the box itself for the phone was in perfect condition so I don't really care. As for the product, I didn't think I'd get a SIM card with it. To my surprise I did. Was a seamless number transfer and as usual I'm very pleased. Phone works great.",5
"This phone met and exceeded my expectations. The processor is fast, the phone was in great condition, and I have no complaints. Great phone, great price, great service from the seller.",5
"I had a iPhone 4s prior and was more pleased with it. The 5S is good, sometimes it's slow... Overall not a bad phone. Love the fingerprint for security. Looks great too .",4
My poor daughters phone she finally got malfunction and has to send it back and pay 500 for Apple to fix at worst case and 250 for best case scenario....feel bad for her :(,1
The phone works great but when I tried to activate the SIM card the phone went into an endless loop. Now I have to wait for Straight Talk to send me a new sim so I can actually use the phone as a phone instead of a very expensive iPod touch. Not happy.,1
"I never got any information on how to activate the phone, it ask for a sim card, only i dont know which one to get. It was suppose to come with instructions. As of right now im waiting for a reply from the company. Phone looks good tho.",2
Great Phone ! Only problem was and still is the service. This phone is Verizon towers but through straight talk. It won't let me text on iMessage or get on Internet without wifi. But the phone itself is great with wonderful pictures. Just make sure you fight hard to get a good service,4
Arrived very quickly even though it was the holidays. Everything promised was in the box. Item works perfectly. I would purchase from this vendor again.,5
When I got the phone I tried to set it up with straight talk and the SIM card would not work with straight talk then later I found out the iPhone was for track phone but the phone was brand new as described,3
"Works great!! Wasn't the exact color as I thought it would be but it's okay. Came in freshly new, the sim card was attached and it worked; I just love it. Exactly how it said in the description. Would buy from this seller again (:",5
"I though this IPhone 5s is ready to use where ever I want but I'm so disappointed.I brought that Phone with me to Cambodia to use as my pleasure but it was lock the code.I was told that phone is ready to use but it too bad I have to bring that phone back to US to retrieve that,",1
"Don't buy.Bought this for my husband bout 3 months ago,And his phone is all messed up like the phone keeps restarting and the screen turns blue u can't do any Thing on it, and can't return it or replace cause return day is up :/Pay the extra money for a phone.",1
"I received the iPhone 5S but when I got it there was not a SIM card, there is a SIM card number but no actual Sim card as the description said there was.",1
I finally upgraded to a gold iPhone 6 from an iPhone 4. Huge difference and I believe that this phone will last me for a long time as the quality appears far superior to any other phone on the market. The camera is crystal clear. The processor is fast and does not freeze up at all. Awesome phone!,5
"The phone came with all of the articles as promised. Everything was wrapped nicely and it got delivered well before the supposed day of delivery, with two holidays considered. It works just fine, like new.",5
"The phone is nice, great shape. BUT, it is not compatible with Sprint as it says it is. It is a GSM phone. This made it more of a hassle than I was expecting. Was not worth the headache since I could've easily chosen another and been good to go with a simple SIM swap.",1
paid the money phone never made home. It was horrible experience and the person never emailed me back. I emailed 4 times. Do NOT buy phone from this!!,1
"Got the phone super quickly, it freaked out a little bit when I first plugged it into my computer but that was the only issue I had. That was over 2 weeks ago and I haven't had a single problem since. Phone works beautifully and the condition was ""Like New"" as advertised, not even a scratch on the screen.",5
When we received it the phone was password protected and we could not use it. I emailed and I received the pass code. Phone looks and works great as advertised .,5
"Can't hear very well , have to turn on speaker . I did have this cover put on it though: COMC Extreme Shockproof iPhone 6 Aluminum Case [Metal Hybrid Silicone] Dust/Dirt Proof Military Heavy Duty Protection Cover Waterproof Case for Apple iPhone 6 4.7 Inch (Black)and wondering if anyone else is having this problem?",3
"I have been using apple for years, this phone is my favorite yet! Awesome quality camera, front and back. Plenty of storage, I have thousands of pictures, many songs and apps, with plenty memory left. Fits in your hand perfectly and I love the sleek design. Overall a great product!",5
"Great phone, looked better than expected. Only issue, seller failed to mention the home button was fixed so it doesn't work for touch i.d which I won't send back for but it's good to know when there's issues with product.",4
I love it but only problem wit charge so I went to Apple Store for replace new battery. There me go wit beautiful iPhone but not a bad on scatch.. Thk y so still working all the way,3
"I love this phone! I had a 5C for several years. This is bigger, but not as big as the plus size apple phones. I love some of the upgrades but touch ID is my favorite. Love apple products but have been disappointed with some apple decisions.",5
Beautiful refurbished instrument...no signs of use.Will never purchase a new phone from phone service again and pay for it on my bill when the same product is available for half the price.Thank-you!,5
Phone was exactly as described and works perfectly. The tracking number was off when I was notified that it shipped but a quick email returned a prompt reply with the correct tracking number.,5
"The phone was in like-new condition. It works perfectly, I've had it activated on ACN's Flash (Verizon) Network for a couple of days now. Great value, I'm glad I purchased this.",5
I was very excited when I got my phone but when I went to go activate it at my Verizon the phone was reported lost an stolen was not very pleased with that,1
My son is very happy with thus phone. I purchase a use phone that came in great shape and looked like it's never been used. It was well worth the money!,5
The phone I received was not described as in the post. The screen was clearly replaced but not replaced properly making the multi-touch defective in some spots. Also the speaker does not work. Not something I would buy again.,2
This is an excellent product.The 64GB memory is the most important factor for me.The phone is my main entertainment center for almost constant travel.My only caveat is the battery charge life. I bought an external battery that seconds as a robust cover.,5
"Just as advertised!!!Shipped and Arrived in good timeiPhone arrived in original packaging, with original Apple charger and headphones. Even had the apple sticker!",5
"I love it. I was worry at first to buying an used phone from online because I was paying a lot of money for something that I have never seen specially for an electronic device, but I actually love with my purchase. The phone is in a very good condition. I hardly recommend buying it.",5
"The screen stopped working after 4 months of use. Now I have to replace my phone with a brand new one, this was a very costly mistake. Don't waste your money with these phones.",1
"The phone is fine, but it was advertised as new. It wasn't. There was a phone number in it and I had to go to verizon to delete the number, get another sim to put my number in.",3
The phone is ok apple could've done better with the ear piece it can be hard to hear the person you're talking to and but the phone being a sim phone the phone signal suck big time.,4
"Ordered the silver one with a white front and was sent the black space grey one I actually was trying to avoid while searching for an iPhone 6. The phone works great though so I can't complain too much, just wish I would've gotten the color I wanted",3
"The front flash make all my pictures black. If it wasnt for that, i would give it 5 stars because iPhones are the best. But that is just a seller issue, not a phone issue",2
Waste of money. Very frustrating. When I spend more than the equivalent a truck payment on a phone I expect it to activate. Hopefully the return goes better.,1
This is the first negative review I have ever written. The phone was expensive and when it arrived not only was it so scratched up on the screen (definitely not normal wear and tear) but the phone did not work! Callers could not hear me. Very frustrating experience and first time I had a bad experience ordering through Amazon.,1
"Works as expected since I bought it several months ago. As everyone knows, it is bigger (but thinner) than the iPhone 5. Took it to Verizon and got it hooked up to our network without incident. Saved about $200 doing it this way (with a refurbished phone).",4
I bought this phone and I absolutely love it! It's just like brand new as if I went and bought it directly from the Apple Store! Not a scratch on it! I received two cases and a charger with it. I couldn't be more happier. Thanks so much for the awesome purchase!!,5
To sum it up for you in comparison to ANY OTHER PHONEPros:it looks good and it worksCons:needs an external backup battery to last through a work dayneeds protector caseneeds screen protectorneeds money for apps monopolistmy old phone didn't need any of that,4
"The phone had scratches as stated, but when I talk to Siri or on the phone it can't hear me , same with videos if someone says anything you can't hear it. And the battery came defected I go from 90 percent to 70 percent in 10 minutes.",2
"I have nothing but good to say about this product, it looks brand new and works great. All I did was put the sim in and it worked, I am very impressed with cellcow and hope that this review was helpful.",5
"Slim, Sleek, and fast. This phone is everything and above what I could ever hoped it would be. Fast processing, amazing quality on both screen resolution and picture quality. The size does take some time to get use to especially if you are switching from a smaller phone, but it is well worth the adjustments.",5
"The phone came on time, the item was doubled up with packaging. I had to buy the SIM card from Verizon but no issues at all to connect. My Granddaughter is enjoying her iPhone 6.",5
"After spending 4 HOURS AT VERIZON on my day off trying to activate this phone, only to find out from Apple and Verizon that this phone is an AT&T Iphone 6. I am so beyond angry. Ruined my Saturday. Thanks a lot. Sending it back NOW",1
"I love the iPhone. I have had Android phones, Windows phones, and iPhones. I will stick with the iPhone. The seller was great and the phone arrived quickly. Thanks!",5
"Guaranteed to be 100% functional? Yeah right. Worked for a few weeks, then stopped charging. Took it in to the Apple Store, who opened it up and saw that the refurbish job was sloppy. Screws were missing, the screen was third-party, etc. Seemed likely that whatever was wrong with the phone was a shoddy part stopped working. Don't buy this.",1
This iPhone does not work. It appears that at some point in the life of the phone it was submerged in water. The screen resolution does not work and the battery does not charge. Where should I return it?,1
Garbage. Motherboard puked after 4 months and didn't know the warranty was for 30 days. Phone was never dropped or had water damage. DO NOT BUY from these losers. They said oh so nicely that there was nothing they could do. Obviously they are selling inferior products if they are not willing to stand behind them.SAVE YOUR MONEY,1
I didn't even have it for a month and the screen started glitching and it seriously looked like a strobe light. Went to apple and they couldn't fix it because it had 3rd party parts that most likely caused the damage so they gave me a new phone.THANK GOD FOR APPLE.,1
I wanted to face time with my grandchildren so I bit the bullet and enlisted in the iCult.But I did not like it so I return the phone and bought an android from Verizon instead. MUCH better.,1
"I love it!There were very minor scratches around the edges of the phone, but you would have to really analyze the phone in order to see it. Great working condition, I have no complaints what so ever. I just wish the shipping was a bit faster, since I really phone during the time I ordered it.",5
"It's been three months since I got this phone. My only complaint is battery life is low...but otherwise, this phone is beautiful. It came quickly, looked like new , and is just wonderful.",4
"I bought the Iphone 6 for my niece and she loves it. Since she received the phone, she has not had any issues. I would recommend Complex Melodies to friends. The deliver was less than five days Overall, I am satisfied with the company.",4
"So i was very skeptical on if i should get this because some reviews weren't the best and you never know with buying online, but i got it in apple packaging, with all the cords so organized and i was pleasantly surprised that the phone was perfect condition, perfect everything. So I'm very pleased, and i do recommend because its well worth it!",5
I was very excited when I got my phone but when I went to go activate it at my Verizon the phone was reported lost an stolen was not very pleased with that,1
iPhone 6 is a solid phone that is simplistic with the operating system. I like the thinner design and power button on the side. A good product from Apple.,5
"Phone was as described, I LOVED the courtesy card inside saying to feel free to contact him if anything is wrong which I found pretty awesome! All in all Great!",5
It's a beautiful color the Space Gray and just as they advertise in the picture it was shipped immediately and the customer service was excellent. I will purchase again from them package got here in three days I activated the phone immediately and it works perfect I rate it a 5 I'm very happy.,5
I bought this phone that clear stated that its compatible with sprint only to call sprint and for them to tell me that's not the case. Such a waste of time!!,1
Delivered ahead of schedule and in mint condition. Only issue was some charge cables did not seat properly and intermittently charged. We have been able to correct so it's working great!,4
"I have had zero problems with the phone itself. I love Apple products and so far it stands up to any other I have had. The phone arrived sooner than expected, so as for the iPhone 6 it is a great device.",4
I have minor problems with the phone. But other than that I love it. Came with charger and headphones wasn't locked. I needed a SIM card and that's it. I'm satisfied.,4
Came to me broken and unable for sprint to activate. If I could give this 0 stars I would. Not only was it incredibly frustrating but took two hours for sprint to trouble shoot it only to find out the couldn't fix it. Wasted my time and money.,1
Great customer service and support. Phone looks and works great. I activated my new phone with ease. It took 10 minutes.Very impressed with overall purchase!!!!,5
Worked great! Had to take it to sprint first to activate but that was free of charge! Came with a few small scratches on the back aluminum but that was barely noticable as well as it was used so that's understandable.,4
"I purchased this phone from an unlocked phone classification under.. but the seller did not indicate the phone is locked in relevant page.it can not be use under other networks,,",1
The phone was in perfect condition went to activate the phone it was good went to use one of my old phones then called sprint like two months later they said the phone was reported stolen and I need to return it . So now I have a phone I will not be able to use ever again !!!!,1
"The iphone 6 is great. Better deal to by from Amazon then get service, vs. getting trapped in a contract. I have the $50 plan with sprint and that's it!",5
My iPhone that I ordered from Amazon worked great. I had no issues with turning it on or getting it activated. Came unscathed with charging equipment. I am highly satisfied and love my phone!,5
Unbelievable!!! Received phone and the previous owner never released it - SPRINT can't set it up for us and keeps getting an error message because of it.,1
"Great phone, holds lots of memory. Just mad I didn't know that sprint phones can not be unlocked so I had to open an account with sprint, but in all honesty, I like sprint service better than what I originally had.",5
I rated this two stars only because when I received the phone it didn't meet the description. Buts its not a 0 because the seller was very understanding and I got my money back right away!,2
"so far its been working great! the only thing is, im not sure if they replaced the screen beause the circle around the front camera is not perfectly set, so it looks like its cutting into the view but so far the camera has been working fine! overall very happy with this purchase!",5
"Did not come with SIM card, also the accessories were not authentic from Apple. And took (4-5 days to arrive). Overall, phone was in like-new condition. But the rear camera does not function.",4
This iPhone 6 has been nothing but great to me! It was in the exact condition that the description said it was I feel like I paid s great price for a new iPhone 6! Thank you! It's getting taken care of!,5

"Came in great condition. Kinda had to wait a couple days more because I wasn't home to sign so I went to fedex and picked it up. The iPhone 6 is was packaged in its original box with its usb cable,wall charger and EarPods. I made a great purchase!",5
I was extremely happy with the phone. It was exactly as stated. I was just a little disappointed with the product not being shipped for over 24 hours after my purchase even though I purchased it on a non holiday Monday.,5
"I am very satisfied with the purchase, i got my iPhone 6 on time and even received a screen protectant with a charger. Thank you so much for the iPhone 6, it was worth the wait.",5
"Delivery took a little longer than expected (since I paid extra to expedite), and I also hadn't realized that phone didn't come with charger or any other accessory, but otherwise phone works great.",4
"iPhone was listed Used but Very Good and besides one tiny, not deep nick (which i probably caused from forcing in my old charger) the phone looked BRAND NEW. I will DEFINITELY be buying from this seller again and I highly recommend.",5
Don't buy this phone if you want a usa phone It is not a real usa phone. It is different in how it reacts to recent OS updates than the US versions. They do not say that. The inference is that this is a usa phone. It was not,1
Bought an this iPhone because I needed a new phone. It came in and was satisfied! Bought it from Supreme Deals 18. They are authentic and would def buy from them again,5
The phone came really fast. I could tell the phone used to have a cracked screen because whoever replaced didn't align the screen & the phone all the way. Overall the phone came in great condition for the price! Occasionally it'll freeze but if I lock & unlock the phone it goes back to working normal again.,4

"I bought a new phone, nevertheless I was informed by Apple that there was no guaranty for this iPhone. Is it true? Why did it happen? A new product should come with at least 1 year guaranty.",2
Can't find anything like this price. phone came absolutely intact and all the headphones and chargers are brand new. loved it! worked immediately after i set up my phone in AT&T.,5
Great phone I was able to turn it on with my cell phone provider works perfectly phone came in great condition. Would recommend to anyone great price too!,5
"Huge issue with this order, the phone I received is stolen. It worked fine oversees, but once I got back and inserted a us sim, the phone get locked, it is registered to a stolen phone in US, I am also writing to amazon regarding this issue.",1
"The phone I bought isn't an AT&T phone. The SIM card from AT&T didn't work, the rep at the store said he doesn't know who the carrier is, but it's not them. Returning it.",2

Amazing! It actually came the next day with Prime. I was skeptical at first because so many people said they had various issues with the product. None so far! Highly recommend! Definitely an upgrade from my iPhone 5c!,5
"The item appeared to be slightly used, re-packaged and not brand new in box as advertised. Box was not sealed but had been opened and SIM card had been installed but nevertheless acceptable.",4
"I ordered the phone brand new & it appears to me that is exactly what I got, it works without any issues, came exactly as described, with the charger & brand new headphones!!! The box was complete with everything you get when you buy from the actual store!!!",4
Bought this phone for my wife and she loves it. It has lots of room for all of her pictures and it takes great ones! She has had it nearly a year now with no problems. Very happy with this product.,5
"The phone was amazing! My crush loved it!' Worked perfectly . She liked taking selfies with it too '. She activated it with T-Mobile even though it's from AT&T. So, you can probably activate it with any carrier. HAS to be a GOOD store . Not the small stores .",5
Got this for my daughter as she is on straighttalk and cracked her iPhone 5 so figured at this price is upgrade her to the 6...so far the phone works great....simply removed her straighttalk sim card and put it in the new one and it works fine...she is very happy and pleased.,5
Cosmetically flawed on the home screen. Lots of scratches. Biggest issue is the battery status of the iPhone I received. I am very disappointed that the phone was shipped with a battery that seems faulty. It constantly jumps around and dies extremely fast. I may end up purchasing a new battery for the phone.,2
"I purchased mine from seller JD Auction Warehouse. Item was better than described. Works perfectly. It was shipped same day and arrived earlier than expected. I am extremely pleased with my purchase. It is the AT&T model, but it is unlocked. Extremely pleased with my purchase.",5
"0 stars.Its a locked phone.We were unable to activate it, as it's still attached to another plan.I will be returning this phone for a full refund.Disappointed,Andrea Sommer",1
I have had this phone for a day. A DAY. It turns itself off and won't turn back on for hours. Pretty useless. I would not recommend this product to anyone.,1
"I absolutely love this phone. I've had the same iPhone 5 since December 2014 and it was in pitiful shape, dropped way too many times... this iPhone 6 is like going from eating hamburger to steak! Haha",5
"The product would have been fine, but it was not fully functional. I had to return it in the end. The return process was very easy and refund/exchange was offered with the utmost courtesy.",4
"I absolutely love this phone. Sure it's not the latest one, but it gets the job done. Battery life sucks, yes, but that's okay. Camera quality is good enough, and the colors available is great! Awesome phone.",5
"Hello, I wanted to unlock the phone on AT & T and I respond that I pay to unlock the phone.I need you to unlock my phone and reminded me.That data need to unlock AT & T?Otherwise I'll open a case on Amazon because you have cheated me.",1
"In the explanation part it was saying that the phone was factory unlocked, I took it my country but it didn't work. Because it wasn't factory unlocked! I want to return this item but unable contact the seller!",1
This phone was stolen!! Thought that because I was buying it from a company that I wouldn't have to worry about that as much. I got it activated at AT&T and within 20 minutes my device was blocked. It was reported stolen. This is a huge pain and i'm really angry and upset about it.,1
Product was refurbished I purchased as new. iPhone not working properly and it would shut off by itself. I returned it quickly and my money was refunded.,2
We liked the Apple iPhone 6 because it makes our life so much easier. The updated apps makes it easy to use. We like the fact that the iPhone came to us in almost perfect condition. There was a small blemishe on the side other than that the phone met and exceeded all of our expectations.,5
"cheap, but it serves the purpose of protecting my phone and holding my cards. good magnet closure. inflated price for the product. but i could not find a quality case that holds cards. feels cardboard-ish.",2
I got this from some friend in Asia and it work right out of the box. the phone is use but it look new to me and it is unlock to use for any carrier.When I first got the phone I call Apple and give them IMEI number and it is clean phone no icloud lock or stolen phone,5
Love the phone! The only issue I have is that the speaker that is to use on Siri and when using the speaker phone for people to hear me has stopped working unless I yell into it.,5
Payed a lot of money for said phone and had it activated Saturday March 19th. All seemed fine. Received first call on Monday and couldn't hear the caller. Thought maybe it was their phone. Nope it's this one. Seller won't take return! Now I have to get credit card involved for someone who sells junk!,1
"Awesome phone in excellent condition. Worked perfectly. Only complaint was a little heart attack I had when I saw the sticker on the back of the phone read it was a Verizon phone which wouldn't work on the att network. Turned out that it was fine worked perfectly. Love my new iPhone 6. Oh, and super fast shipping!",5
"The cell in very good physical condition and performance.The cable and hub to charge the battery soon not served, sent a message that is not original, so I had to buy these accessories in Ecuador are very expensive and found them worth $ 70. A part of this cell it works perfectly.",3
"Was really worried that the product would not be as described. It's literally like a new iPhone! Don't waste your money elsewhere! Sleek, not a scratch or dent anywhere. Buy it!",5
